""' Society
is
indeed a contract.
Subordinate
contracts, for
objects of mere
occasional interest, may be dissolved at pleasure ; but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing
better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper
and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern to be taken up for a
little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties.
It is to
be looked on with other reverence ; because it is not a partnership
in things sub-
servient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature.
It is a partnership in all science ; a partnership
in all art ; a partnership in every
virtue , and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership
not only between those who are
living , but between those who are living , those who are dead, and those who are to
be born ."

PREFACE .
I AM glad to have the opportunity of welcoming
the present work,
both because I am
sure that the Contrat Social
should
be
more
studied
than
it is, and
because
the
general
reader
needs
such
guidance
as Mr.
Tozer's
edition
supplies .
An
Introduction
is imperatively
required
as a clue
to that
strange
and
significant
metamorphosis
of ideas in which Rousseau's
work marks perhaps
the most conspicuous
crisis .
How the notion of a Law of Nature
grew up
out of the practice
of a Roman
court in which
disputes
between foreigners
were
decided , how
out of the notion of a Law
of Nature there arose under
many influences
and by slow degrees
the
formula
of a freedom
and
equality
innate in man , how the
› idea of individual consent
was invoked in order to reconcile
this
inborn freedom
with the facts
of social
authority , and
how the
fiction of individual
consent
passed into the theory of a general ,
social , or rational
will ,—all this forms
as fascinating
a chapter
as
the
history
of
ideas
contains .
And
in this
development
the
Contrat
Social
holds
a
place
which
we
should
hardly
have
expected
from the
current
reputation
of
its
author
,
or
from the
iti


iv
Preface .
actual
effect of his
writings
in
his
own
day .
I hope
that
Mr.
Tozer's edition may cause the
Contrat Social
to be
more
read
for its own sake , not
apart from
its
true
context , but
apart from
the preconceptions
with which
others
of
Rousseau's
writings
have surrounded
it.
So different , indeed , in the way of practical
politics
is Rousseau's
atmosphere
from our own , that we have to
interpret
his
ideas
with
the same kind of allowance
which
we
make
for
a
writer
of antiquity.
But
when all
is
said ,
the
principle that " Will , not Force, is the
basis
of the State " has
never
been
more
effectively
proclaimed
than by Rousseau , and
excepting
Plato
and
Aristotle,
there
is
perhaps
no writer
who
forms
a better
starting -point
for
the study
of the
principles
of political
obligation
.

PREFACE
TO THE
SECOND
EDITION .
So
FAR
as I
can
discover ,
no new English
translation
of
Rousseau's
Contrat Social was published during the century
that
ended with the
year
1894 , while
only one
reprint
of an earlier
edition was issued .
The fact that the
first edition of the present
translation
has
been
exhausted
in
rather
more than two years
may, it is
hoped ,
be
regarded
as
one
among
many
signs
of
renewed
interest
in political philosophy
in England and America.
In this edition a few
inaccuracies
have
been
corrected , and
some
slight
alterations
have
been
made
with the
object
of
removing
misconceptions
that have arisen on certain
points .
Those who desire to study
Rousseau's
work more thoroughly
may now be
referred
to the
admirable
edition
of the
Contrat
Social
(Paris,
1896 )
by
M.
Edmond
Dreyfus -Brisac.
This
scholarly
volume
supplies
a large number of parallel
passages
from
various
authors
and
from Rousseau's
other
works , together
with valuable
appendices
illustrating from autograph
manuscripts
at Geneva and Neuchâtel
the development
of Rousseau's
political
conceptions
.

INTRODUCTION
.
THE French
Revolution was no sudden
outburst
of fury against
oppression . It was rather the tardy outcome
of a vast assemblage
of heterogeneous
conditions, moral , social ,
economic , political,
and
religious —a slowly manifested
revuision
against
centuries of
unavenged
wrong .
The
multiform evils of the
long
period of
autocratic
government
that had
culminated
in the reign of Louis
XIV . , the incalculable injury to commerce
and
industry
resulting
from perpetual
wars , the overwhelming
financial
burdens
imposed
upon the people by government , nobles , and clergy , the ruthless
persecutions
of Huguenots and Jansenists by the
ecclesiastical
abettors of royal despotism , the
grievous
misrule
of Louis XIV.'s
successors and their ministers , —all these circumstances
concurred
with the growth of new and
pregnant
ideas on
the various
sub-
jects of human
interest to evoke that great
awe-inspiring outburst
of popular
wrath , which
proclaimed
that the
many
should
no
longer be the bond-slaves of the few .
Among those who generated
and directed
the forces by which
the
materials
of that terrific
eruption
were
concentrated
and
ignited,
Rousseau
stands
pre -eminent .
In the
writings
and
speeches of the
revolutionary
leaders his political
doctrines
are
more
distinctly traceable
than
those of any
other
thinker ; and
friendly and
hostile
critics have
alike
acknowledged
the
para-
mount importance
of his work in shaping
and disseminating
the
explosive
ideas
that
kindled
the
flames of revolution . " The
world ," said a vigorous
critic ,* " has not seen more than
once or
twice in all the course of history
a literature
which has exercised

such prodigious
influence
over the minds of men , over
every
cast
and
shade of intellect , as that which emanated
from
Rousseau
between
1749 and
1762."
While radical reformers
have
extolled
Rousseau
as the founder
of a new era , conservatives
have regarded
with contempt
or horror the
passionate
enthusiast
who declared
in burning words the inalienable
sovereignty
of the people.
This
doctrine , long before enunciated , though
never clearly
realised
by
the masses until Rousseau
preached it, was impressed
once for all
upon Europe by the Revolution.
Since
1789 the tide of popular
freedom
has rolled rapidly onward , renewing
and purifying
the
nations .
A thousand
ancient
privileges
which, by their survival ,
proved
formidable
barriers
to political progress
have been gra-
dually undermined
and
submerged
; and this
beneficent
process
of
reformation
not
only
continues , but
operates
with
acceler-
ating
force .
The feudal
and ecclesiastical
principle
that
certain
orders in the State are divinely invested
with political power
is
fast
vanishing
before the loftier democratic
principle that every
member of the social
organism
should
share the rights and duties
of citizenship .
The Social
Contract
has a double
claim to be considered
an
epoch -making
work : historically,
on
account
of
its
enormous
influence
upon European life and
thought
;
and
,
philosophically
,
because
it
is
the most
eloquent
expression
of
the theory of
a
social
compact
.
An adequate
appreciation
of
Rousseau's
work
,
and
a
true
idea
of
the significance
of certain
doctrines
to
which
he gave free currency
,
and which
to
-
day subsist
in
full vigour
,
can
be obtained
only by an
enquiry into the origins
of
his principal
theories-those
of
the social contract
and
of
popular
sovereignty
.
The purpose
of
this Introduction
is
to
sketch briefly the develop-
ment of these and kindred theories
,
with especial
reference
to
the
writers by whom
Rousseau
was most influenced
.*
*
The inexact
statement
of the
social
contract theory
in
Mr.
Raleigh's
little book
on Elementary
Politics
(p
.
6,
fifth
edition
)
illus-
trates the need
of
some
account
of
the theory
in
its various develop-
ments
.
No general
statement
can adequately
cover
the different
versions of even Hobbes
,
Locke
,
and Rousseau
.

Introduction
.
ROUSSEAL
I.
Rousseau
had a profound admiration
for the political ideals
of ✔
antiquity .
This
is manifested
in his direct borrowings
from the
treatises of Plato and Aristotle , as well as in his frequent references
to the constitutions
of Sparta and
Rome, which, like his
contem-
poraries , he lauded
without
much knowledge
or
discrimination
.
The subordination
of the individual
to the State , which was the
dominant feature of these
ancient
polities , was also , as we shall
see, the
leading
characteristic
of
Rousseau's
own
theory .
In
1
Hellas or in Rome the citizen had but
few personal
rights
; his
conduct was largely
subject
to public censorship , and his religion
was imposed by State authority . In Plato's and in Aristotle's
works
the fundamental
features of Hellenic States are retained
unaltered
;
the
only true citizens
and
members
of the sovereign body being
an aristocratic
caste of freemen , whose manual work is performed
by slaves possessing no civic rights .
ra
T

The notion of a social contract
may be found in Plato .
Socrates
(Crito , 49-52) is
represented
as contending
that
whoever , after
reaching
man's estate, voluntarily remains
in a city , should
submit
S
to the government , even when
he deems
its
laws unjust
;
accord-
ingly
,
on the ground
that he would break his
covenant with the
3
State by escaping
from prison
into exile
,
he
determines
to
await
the execution
of
an unjust
sentence
.
Again
,
in
Republic
,
II
.
359
,
Glaucon
,
who probably represents
the views
of
the Sophists
as
modified by
Socrates
,
affirms
in
the
course
of
a
discussion
on
justice
that
legislation
and
contracts
between
man
and
man
originated
in
a
compact
of
mutual
abstinence
from
injustice
.
Plato
depicts
in
the
Republic
a
kind
of
idealised
Sparta
.
He
✓traces the origin
of
society and the State
to
mutual
need
,
for men
as
isolated
beings
are
incapable
of
satisfying
their
manifold
wants
.*
In
an ideal State philosophers
should
rule
;
and
to
this expect
aristocracy
,
or
government
of
the best
,
the body
of
citizens would
owe implicit
obedience
.
Plato's emphasis

of

ing and
education
of citizens
finds
a
parallel
in
Rousseau's
Émile.
From
While
Plato
aimed
at constructing
an ideal
State , Aristotle
in
his
Politics
expounded
an
elaborate
political
theory
in
a
purely
scientific
spirit.*
He
was the first to disentangle
politics
from
ethics , though he was
careful
not to
sever
them .
The
majority of men , he urged , are ruled by their passions rather than
by reason , and the State must
therefore
train them to virtue by a
life-long course of discipline, as in Sparta .
Until political society
is instituted
there is no administration
of justice .
Since the State
is
a
supreme
and
all-embracing
society
for the promotion
of
virtue , and
since the highest good and the complete
happiness
of
the individual
can only be realised in the State , it is necessary
to
enquire into the best constitution
and the best system of legislation .
The germ of the State is found in the family
or household .
the union of several households
arose the village
community
, the
members of which were blood-relations , subject to the kingly rule
of the eldest
male , in
other
words , to patriarchal
government
.
By the
association
of several
villages
was
formed
the
State , a
natural , independent
, and
self-sufficing
organisation .
The
State
is the complete
development
of the household
and the individual ,
though prior to these " in nature ," since
it is a whole
of which
they are parts .
But while the household
is ruled
monarchically ,
in
constitutional governments
the
subjects
are free and
on an
equality with their rulers .
Natural sociability
and mutual advan-
tage impel men to union .
Man is by nature
a political animal .
But , although
the
impulse
to political
association
is innate , the
actual
formation
of
States
must
be
due
to the
initiative
of
particular persons .
The State is much more than an alliance which individuals can
join or leave without
effect , for the independent
or cityless
man
(aπodes ) is unscrupulous
and
savage , something
essentially
differ-
ent from a citizen .
The members of a State are numerous , and
they differ in their personal
qualities
; it is by the co -operation
of
* Ethics, X. 9.

5
its various
parts in the performance
of their proper
functions , and
by the reciprocal
equality
of these parts , that
the State is
consti-
tuted
an
organic
whole , and
its
preservation
secured .
(Republic , III.) had
anticipated
this conception
of the State as a
body whose members
combine
harmoniously
for a common
end .*
Aristotle
held that
where
freedom
and
equality
prevail
there
should be alternate
rule and
subjection , but it is best , if possible ,
that
the
same
persons
should
always
rule .
In opposition to
Plato's communism
, he argued in favour of duly regulated
private
property,
considering
that
only
a
moral
unity
is
possible
or
desirable in the State .
Aristotle divided
governments
into
monarchies
, aristocracies ,
and
republics
(Toλreía ) , and their respective
perversions , tyran-
nies,
oligarchies ,
and
democracies ,
according
as the supreme
power is in the hands of one or a few or the many , and according
as the end
is the general
good
or the private
interests
of the
rulers, regard
being
also paid to
freedom , wealth , culture , and
nobility .
Each polity consists of three parts-the deliberative , the
executive , and
the
judicial
bodies .
Citizenship
is
constituted
neither by residence , nor by the possession
of legal rights , but by
participation in judicial
power
and
public
office .
The
many ,
having attained
a certain
standard of morality , should
rule ; for,
though individually inferior , they are collectively
wiser and more
virtuous than a select few .
But, while undertaking
all deliberative
and judicial functions
, they should
be excluded
from the highest
executive
offices .
The
best
polity is that in which the middle
class
between
the
very
rich
and
the
very
poor
controls
the
government , for that class has the most permanent
life , and is the
most conformable
to reason , as well as the most capable of consti-
tutional action .
This is virtually an
affirmation
that
sovereignty
should
reside
in the majority of the
citizens , slaves of course
being ignored .
Democracies
agree in being based on equality
in
respect
of personal
liberty, which
implies
the eligibility of
all
citizens
to hold
,
or
elect
to
,
the
offices of State
,
and
the rule of
each
over all
and all
over
each
in
turn
.

The Social Contract.
treated
democracy
as a debased
form
of government
,
and
held
that it is more suitable
to large
States than to any others.
Like
Plato, too, he concerned
himself chiefly with
small
city-states
of
the Hellenic
type-States
large enough
to be independent , and
small enough for all citizens
to be acquainted
with one another .
The conquests of Alexander changed
the aspect of the Greek
world ; and the tendency
to individualism
that
manifested
itself
upon the decay of the national
spirit
in Greece
found
expression
in the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies
.
The Stoics , developing
the principles
of the Cynics, made
a great
advance
towards
cos-
mopolitism .
They regarded
all
men
as
partakers
in
the divine
reason
,
and
as
members
of
one
community
subject
to
nature's
universal
law
,
which
required
observance
of
contracts
and
absti-
nence from injury
.
The Epicureans
revived
the notion
of
a
com-
pact
as
the basis
of
justice
.
Justice
,
said Epicurus
,
is
nothing in
itself
,
but
merely
a
compact
of
expediency
to
prevent
mutual
injury
.
Little of direct importance
was added
to
political theory by the
Romans
,
but
in
a
closely allied
department
-
viz
.,
Jurisprudence-
they made contributions
of
deep interest
and
value
.
Under the
Republic there had grown
up beside the Civil Law
(
Jus Civile
)
a
collection
of
rules and principles
called
the Jus Gentium
,
which re-
presented the common
features
of
the institutions
prevailing
among
the Italian tribes
.
The great Roman jurisconsults
,
deriving
from
the Stoics the idea
of
a
natural condition of society anterior
to
the
formation
of
States
,
came gradually
to
identify
the Law of Nature
(
Jus Naturale
)
with the Jus Gentium
.
They taught that this law
was divine and eternal
,
and that
,
being
imposed
by natural
reason
on all mankind
,
it
was superior
in
majesty and validity
to
the laws
of particular
States
.
Natural law was
supposed
to
be
actually
existent and bound
up with civil law
,
though distinguishable
from
it
by its
greater
simplicity
,
harmony
,
and
generality
.
In the
Antonine era
,
when Roman Law attained
a
high development
and
Stoic doctrines
were
most
influential
,
the jurists formulated
as
juridical
,
but not
as
political principles
,
the maxims
that all men
were born free

and that by the law
of
nature all men are equal-

.
These unfounded
assumptions
of
a
state
of
nature
and
a
natural
law
,
which thus obtained
a
kind
of
authoritative
recognition
,
were
destined
to
exercise
extraordinary
influence
on
mediæval
and
modern political theories

Gre
The Roman jurists did not postulate
a
contract
as
the origin
of

civil society
;
but
it
has been suggested that Roman Law produced
a
strong tendency
to
deduce
recognised
rights
and obligations
from
a
supposed
,
but non
-
existent
contract
.
With
regard
to
@sovereignty
,
the citizens assembled
in
the comitia tributa
exercised
the
supreme
power
during the golden
days
of
the
Republic
.
Under the
Empire
,
the
sovereign
authority
was
vested
in
the
Emperor
,
and
,
according
to
the later jurisconsults
,
the
people
,
by
the lex regia
,
delegated the supreme
command
(
imperium
)
to
each
Emperor
at
the beginning
of
his reign
,
thus
conferring
on him all
their rights
to
govern and legislate

In the Middle Ages the chief representative
of
political theory
,
as
of all scholastic
philosophy
,
was Thomas
Aquinas
(
1226-1274
).
-
Following
the Roman jurists
,
who were assiduously
studied
at
this
period
,
Thomas recognised
a
natural
law
,
the principles
of which
have
been
divinely implanted
in
human
reason
,
together
with
e.
positive
laws
that
vary
in
different
States
.
He held that the
legislative
power
,
the essential attribute
of
sovereignty
,
should
be
11
directed
to
the common
good
,
and that
,
for the attainment
of
this
end
,
it
should
belong
to
the multitude
or
to
their
representative
,
the
prince
.
A
mixed
government
of
monarch
,
nobles
,
and

,
with the Pope
as

authority
,
seemed
to
him the
best

The Social Contract .
promulgated
at Geneva
in 1387. *
Rousseau
was acquainted
with
this charter , but his doctrine
is more
positive
and complete , and
closely
resembles
that
of
Hobbes, from whom he probably
de-
rived it.
He may in some
degree
have
been
affected by Fatio,
who , in 1707 , was appointed
president of a commission
at Geneva
charged
with formulating
the
grievances
of the people .
Fatio
drew up a document
upholding the sovereignty
of the people , the
equality of all citizens , and the subordination
of
magistrates
as
executive
officers .
The
mass of
materials
gathered
from
such
varied
sources
was fused
and
transformed
by Rousseau's
genius
into an
apparently
new product , endowed
with
terrific
energy,
and destined to become the most destructive
of the combustibles
that were soon to set France aflame .
In the Émile
Rousseau
observed
that the science
of political
right had
yet to be
constructed , and
he
despaired
of this
ever
being
done ; Grotius and
Hobbes
had
failed , and
Montesquieu
had
not made
the
attempt .
In the
Social
Contract
Rousseau
himself embarks
on the
doubtful
enterprise , holding that it is
necessary to know what
ought
to
be in
order
to judge
rightly
of
what
is .
" I wish
to
enquire ," he begins , " whether , taking
men as they are and laws as they can be , it is possible
to establish
some
just
and
certain
rule
of
administration
in
civil
affairs ."
This , however , is not really his subject .
He does not seek a rule
of administration
, but an abstract and universal
principle of right.
He does not take men as they are, but men in general , abstracted
from all times , places , and circumstances
.
Sometimes
he appears
to treat the state of nature as historical, sometimes
as a possible
or desirable
condition .
Rousseau , in fact , continually oscillates
between the actual and the ideal , and
this
accounts
for much of
the obscurity
with which he is justly charged .
The
problems
he
propounds
in his first chapter are to discover
how men born free
have become
enslaved , and
to determine
what
can
render
legiti-
mate the
establishment
of civil society .
He admits
that he can-

not settle the former question
(though
he had tried
to do so in the
Discourse on Inequality ) , but believes that he can solve the second .
The
social
order
is a sacred right which serves as a basis for all
others, but it does not come
from
nature
and must
therefore
be
based on conventions
.
We shall see that a hypothetical
conven-
tion
among
men
born
free in an imaginary
state of nature , and
associating
freely , is for Rousseau
the
sole
source
of legitimate
authority in principle , if not in fact .
In the
Social
Contract
we find nothing about
the superiority
of the natural
to the civil
state ;
Rousseau's
enthusiasm
for it
appears
to have
abated .
Thus, in
describing
the
remarkable
change
produced
in
man
by the
passage from
the former to
the
latter ,
he
shows
eloquently
that, if
many
natural
advan-
tages
are
lost , equal
or greater
ones
are secured
(I.
8).
Law
and morality
replace
appetite
and instinct, and
equality
and free-
dom are now realised
under
a system
of impartial laws .
But
notwithstanding partial
desertion
of his
earlier
positions , Rous-
seau still takes the
state of nature
as his
starting -point, and
it
forms
throughout
the
invisible
basis
of his
speculations
.
In
resigning
their
natural
state individuals are supposed
to
retain
intact certain natural
rights , prior to and distinct from those legal
rights which derive
their force from the voluntary social
pact .
A
" right" in any exact sense, however , implies
a state of society in
which is
recognised
the
possession
of
certain
powers
by indi-
viduals , and the term is therefore
strictly inapplicable
till a
State
is constituted
.
Further , Rousseau
assumes
that
primitive men
were isolated
individuals.
But he errs in
seeking
individuality
in a pre-social
state, for true individuality
supposes
civilisation.
Such a conception
is in sociology , as in psychology
, a late growth
;
barbarians
desired
to
conform
all men to
a uniform
type .
In
common, then, with Hobbes and
Locke , Rousseau
posits
as the
basis of his theory
a state of nature
in which men
lived as iso-
lated units , subject only to natural law, free and equal in a certain
sense , and possessing
only the qualities
that
belong to men
as
men ; moreover , all agreed
that , owing
to the
drawbacks
of this
condition, men
emerged
from it by a voluntary, mutual
compact
to
form
a political
society , this
civil
condition
being
sharply

40
The Social Contract .
divided from the state of nature , which is best defined
negatively
as a state in which there
is no
supreme
authority
empowered
to
enforce unquestioning
obedience
to its commands .
"Man is born
free ,
and
everywhere
he
is in chains ."
This
stirring cry is at once the conclusion
of the Discourse on Inequality
and the keynote
of the
Social
Contract .
The proposition
that
man is born free
cannot
of course
be predicated
of men as
re-
vealed
to us
either
by science
or by history
; yet this undemon-
strated
and
exclusive
principle
forms
the
basis
of
Rousseau's
whole
theory .
That men
were
not born free in those
ancient
States which he
so greatly
admired , that children are not born
free in any real
sense, and
that where
several
men
are gathered
together the freedom
of all is mutually
limited, were
facts which
he silently passed
by.
My principles
, he
says in lofty
scorn of
the
pedestrian
experiential
method ,
come
from
the
nature of
things , and are
based
on reason .
Accordingly
he
appeals to
consciousness
, to
sentiment , to
natural
instinct.
To
such
a
method
as this, observation , induction, and
history
are foreign
and irrelevant
; and Rousseau's
meagre
and
inaccurate
historical
knowledge
is used , not to furnish
materials
for inference , but to
illustrate
preconceived
ideas
or foregone
conclusions
.
Not only
does he ignore the innumerable
existing
differences
among
men,
attributable
to race , customs , traditions , beliefs , and
sentiments
,
and
their
objective
embodiment
in institutions
; but he takes no
note of the long and complicated
growth
from which these result,
or of the concurrent
and correlated
development
of the individual
and the society to which he belongs .
Rousseau's
scheme
is that of a doctrinaire
who
is unconscious
of the
infinite
variety
and
complexity
of life , and its apparent
simplicity is mainly
due
to
his inability to
realise and appreciate
the difficulties
of his
task .
He evinced
no insight
into the poli-
tical complications
of his time ; and his total ignorance
of affairs ,
together with his
contempt
for civilised
life , prevented
him from
framing a theory of any practical
utility.
Indeed , the
disastrous
attempt of the Jacobins to apply his principles proved
how value-
less and impracticable
most
of his
doctrines
were .
He never
attempted
to trace
social
and
political
evils to their causes , in

order
to
suggest
suitable
modifications
of
existing
conditions.
He could not see how impossible it was to sweep away all institu-
tions and impose
a wholly
new
social
order
irrespective
of the
natures,
faculties ,
and
desires
of those
whom
he
wished
to
benefit ; on the contrary , he exaggerates
the
passivity
and plasti-
city of
men
and
circumstances
,
and
dreams
that his
model
legislator , who
apparently
is to initiate the
new
society , will
be
-
able to repress all
anti -social
feelings .
He aims
at
order
and
symmetry,
oblivious
that
human
nature
does
not
easily
and
rapidly bend to such treatment . It is his inability to discover
the
true
mode of investigation
that accounts for much of Rousseau's
sophistry .
His
truisms
and
verbal
propositions
, his
dogmatic
assertions
and unreal
demonstrations
, savour
more
of theology
than of political science , while his quasi -mathematical
method of
reasoning from abstract
formulæ , assumed
to be axiomatic , gives
a deceptive
air of exactness and
cogency
which
is apt to be mis-
taken for sound
logic .
He
supports
glaring
paradoxes
with an
array of ingenious
arguments
; and with fatal facility and apparent
precision he
deduces
from
his
unfounded
premisses
a series of
inconsequent
conclusions
, which he
regards
as authoritative
and
universally
applicable.
At times
he
becomes
less
rigid
and
absolute , as when , under the influence of Montesquieu
, he studies
the
relations
between
the physical
constitution
of a
nation , its
territory, its customs , its form of government , and its deep -rooted
opinions , or avows that there has been too much dispute about the
forms of government .
But such considerations
are not prominent
.
In certain
cases his inconsistencies
may be due to rehandling
, but
he is
said
to
have
observed
that
those
who
boasted
of under-
standing the whole
contract
were more clever than he .

The people , however , readily
excused the fallacies
and obscuri-
ties of the book ; his conclusions
at least
seemed
plausible , and

an irresistible

men

as little as
Rousseau for inductive enquiries , and who

been groping
after some better state of things .

"divine
discontent ."
The
age , indeed , was ripe
for
revolution ,
and the inarticulate
multitude , chafing under an effete administra-
tion ,
found
in him
a
fitting
champion .
For such
as
these
Rousseau's
transcendent
power of winging
with
passion
a set of
definite
dogmas
had
an
extraordinary
fascination .
His reason ,
indeed , was
always
at the
mercy
of his feelings , and the
pre-
dominance
of feeling in his constitution
was at once the source of
his enormous
influence
and
the prime
cause of the evil which his
work
produced .
The
emotions
of men ,
which
respond
but
sluggishly
to the
voice
of
reason ,
were
stirred
into
fanatical
fervour
by the
Genevese
preacher
of individual
natural
rights ,
and
thus " the
original
contract , seized on as a watchword
by
Rousseau's
enthusiasm , grew from
an arid fiction into a great and
dangerous
deceit of nations ." *
Before
plunging
into
his subject
Rousseau
deals
with
a few
disputed
topics .
Grotius, he contends , improperly
denied that
all
human
power
is
established
for the
benefit
of
the governed
,
for
people
are born free and equal
,
and alienate
their liberty only for
their own advantage
.
After ridiculing the doctrine
of
divine right
,
he passes
to
the right
of
the strongest
,
which
he
describes
as
a
contradiction
in terms
.
Where force controls
us
,
moral obligation
does not enter
in
;
hence might does not make right
.
We are only
bound
to
obey
legitimate
authority
,
and
we have
to
determine
what
this
is
.
Grotius had
assimilated
political
subjection
to
slavery
,
asserting that
a
people
may sell itself
to
a
king
as
a
slave
sells himself to
a
master
.
But
,
replies
Rousseau
,
"
to
renounce
one's liberty
is
to
renounce
one's quality
as
a
man
;
and he con-
cludes
his
discussion
of
a
subject
which
has fortunately
little
interest
now by remarking
that the
terms
slavery
and right
are
contradictory
and
mutually
exclusive
.
Legitimate
government
implies consent
as
well
as
force
.

general will ; ( 3) the constitution of a government
; and
(4 ) civil
religion .
( 1) " Since no man
has any
natural
authority
over his fellows ,
and since force confers
no
right , conventions
remain
as the basis
of all legitimate
authority
among men ," though not
such unilateral
conventions
to enslave
themselves
as Grotius
postulates
(I. 4).
Political society
is not a mere
aggregation
of isolated
men , but
an
association
duly
organised
and
possessing
public
property .
The act by which a people becomes
a people
is the foundation
of
society ,
and
on
this
first and
unanimous
convention
rests the
obligation of the minority
to submit
to the
majority
(I.
5 ) .
This
convention,
which is
obligatory
only
because
it
is
mutual , is
formed when
men have " reached
a point at which the obstacles
that endanger their preservation
in the state of nature overcome
the forces which each individual
can exert
with
a
view to main-
taining himself in that state."
Since the race would perish unless
it changed
its mode of existence , men combine
their forces.
The
problem is to pledge
their strength
and
freedom
and secure the
advantages
of union without risking their safety and individual
liberty- " to find
a form
of association
which may
defend
and
protect
with
the whole force
of the
community
the
person and
property
of every associate , and
by means of which each , coal-
escing with all, may yet obey himself
alone and remain
as free as
before ."
The social
contract
furnishes
the
solution of the pro-
blem .
Its essential
terms
are : " Each of us
places in common
his person and his whole power
under the supreme
direction
of
the general will ; and
in return
we
receive
every
member
as an
indivisible part
of the
whole ."
The
alienation
being
complete ,
the union
is
perfect ,
and
no
associate
retains
any individual
rights ; further , as the conditions are
equal
for all , no
one
has
any interest in rendering it burdensome
to others .
Each giving
himself to all gives himself to nobody , and since he acquires
over
others the same
rights
that
he concedes
over
himself , he gains
the equivalent
of
all
that
he
loses
and
more
power
to
preserve
what he has
.
"
This
act of association
produces

moral
and
collective
body
”
—a republic
,

,

—
which receives
from
the
act

retains
the French
ideas of unity and
centralisation
; but while
in the
seventeenth
century
the
State
was confounded
with the
monarchy , Rousseau's
influence causes it in the eighteenth
century
to be identified with the people .
As
partakers in the sovereign
power , the members
are called
citizens , and
as being
under the
law, subjects .
By the pact men exchange natural
liberty for civil
and
moral
liberty ; though
it may be objected
to this that the
"natural
rights " of which he
speaks
imply the
existence
of
morality
prior to the pact .
The fundamental
contract also substi-
tutes a moral
and legitimate
equality for the mental
and physical
inequality of nature
(I.
9) .
Rejecting, then , the
right
of the
strongest , divine right , patriarchal
authority ,
and
slavery , Rous-
seau postulates
a social contract
as the basis of civil society
and
morality .
By it the
associates
surrender
their
rights
to
the
community and yet
retain their equality
; whereas , according
to
Hobbes's
version
of the
compact , all agree
to
submit
to the
sovereign
that
they establish , and , according
to
Locke , the pact
may be regarded
indifferently
as an agreement to incorporate
into
a society or to set up a government
with limited powers .
Rousseau's
confusion
of the
actual
and
the
ideal
makes it
difficult to criticise
his doctrines .
When, with a show of precise
detail , he speaks of a
state of nature
and of the transition
from
this state to political society , he appears to imply that
the former
really existed , and lays himself
open to historical
objections
.
No
such sudden
transition , it may
be
argued , was possible
;
a group
of men must have
been long
subject
to custom or to some other
recognised
rule ,-in
other
words ,
must
have
been
inchoately
political , before such
an
idea
could
originate .
Moreover, primi-
tive society was not a collection
of chance
individuals, " without
relations , without
traditions , without
a past , and
without
a coun-
try," bound together
by a
mere
formal
agreement
; it was
an
aggregation
of families , the family
being
the unit of ancient, as
the individual is of modern , society .
Rousseau
perpetually
reverts
from the complex
social
man to the imaginary , isolated , natural
man , who was born
free ; and he treats the social
contract
as an
expedient
for maintaining
this
natural
independence
in
spite of
the social union.
But if " the movement
of progressive
societies


Introduction .

has been a movement
from
Status to Contract," * the notion of a
contract
at the dawn of society is an
anachronism
, a transference
of individualistic ideas to a period
when the individual was merged
in the family.
Again , the historian
is entitled to ask when , where ,
and how the
contract
was
made , and
whether
any
traces
of it
survive ; who were the contracting
parties , and how many were
needed
; whether
it must
be renewed
by us and
our
posterity ,
and , if so, at what
intervals
; and whether
men
must
keep
it if
they become
more enlightened .
But , in spite of his misleading
language , Rousseau
probably did
-
not consider the contract
to
be
historical.
He
acknowledged
that he was ignorant
how natural
freedom
was
lost
( I.
1) , that
the family is the
most
ancient
society
(I.
2) , and
that
primitive
societies were governed
aristocratically
(III . 5) ; he also admitted
that
we
can
only
conjecture
how
nations
have
been
formed
(IV. 4).
In fact , his state of nature
was conceived
rather
as a
condition
in which men would be found
to exist if the swaddling
clothes of civilised
society
could
be
stripped
off.
He is con-
cerned not with fact , but with right ;
and in remarking
that the
clauses
of the contract , " although
they have perhaps
never been
formally
enunciated , are
everywhere
the same, everywhere
tacitly
admitted and recognised ,"
he evidently
refers to the true method
of constituting
a body politic juridically , and to the conditions
necessary
for the formation
of such
a society
on an ideal basis .
According
to Rousseau , then , the nation
is created by concordant
human
wills ;
and by a convenient
fiction ,
analogous
to the
fictions of Roman Law , he
conceived
it as instituted
by a com-
pact .
Hence the State
is an association
of free
and
equal men
working for the common
good , under
the
regulation , and
within
the limitations , of a tacit and implied contract , which apparently
is to be considered
indissoluble
, unless
a return
to the natural
state is
precipitated
by
an
infraction
of the
so-called
natural
rights of individuals.

The
Social Contract .
K
had already overthrown
it in his essay of the Original
Contract
( 1752 ).
Hume
points
out
that
submission
to
chiefs
rests
on
utility, and that military force
or political craft
has usually been
the foundation
of governments , which subjects have at first obeyed
through
fear
or
necessity , and
afterwards
from
habit.
He asks
how the
contract
can
retain
any
authority
when
governments
have undergone
so
many
changes .
The
theory
leads
to para-
doxes repugnant
to the common
sentiments
of mankind and to
the
practice
and
opinion of all nations
and
all
ages."
If we
observe
the supposed
compact , it
is
because
the
interests of
society require
us to keep
our promises ; why not, then (Hume
argues ), make
utility the direct
test
whether
a society
should be
formed
or maintained
?
Bluntschli's objection * that a contract
among
individuals
creates
only
private
rights ,
and
not public
rights , rests
on
a technical
meaning
of the
term
contract, and
therefore
is hardly in point.
It suffices to observe , however , that
nations
are mainly
recruited
by birth , and
that
we are members
of
a
State
in that
we are
the
sons
of
citizens .
The words
"nation " and " patriot" suggest this fundamental
identity of
the State and the family .
We
enter
at birth into a pre -existent
complex
system , in which our rights
and
duties
in relation to
others
are already
defined
; we are
never
isolated
units.
As
Aristotle
perceived , nationality
is prior to any consent of indivi-
duals ,
and the
State
rests
on man's
natural
sociability , not on
an external
and artificial
contract .
If we turn to the
details
of Rousseau's
theory , we shall find
him self-contradictory
.
He had inveighed
against the doctrine of
Grotius that men can bind their posterity , but he has not avoided
the same error .
Against Grotius , also , he had argued that neither
a man nor a nation
can renounce
their freedom
; yet by the com-
pact
every
associate must
effect a total alienation
of himself and
all his rights
to the community
.
He seems afterwards
to have
had an uneasy feeling
that this abdication
was
too complete
and
fraught with perilous consequences
; he therefore
contended
(II . 4)
that a
man
alienated
only a portion of his power , property , and

TO
liberty.
But
as the community
itself is judge of what sacrifices
are necessary , this
concession
to the individual is worthless , for
he has no rights that he can lawfully vindicate .
Further , Rousseau
argued
that there
is
no
real
renunciation
on the
part of indi-
viduals, since the compact
improves
their mode of existence
and
substitutes
inviolable
right
for
natural
power .
If, then, the
alienation is neither
total nor real , Rousseau's
use of the term is
as equivocal as that
of Grotius .
The
modifications
and restric-
tions he tries to
introduce
in his
theory of complete
alienation
are unavailing
.
Even if all the associates make the same sacrifice ,
one's
own
slavery
does
not
become
more
tolerable
;
for ,
as
Rousseau
said
earlier (I. 4), " there
is no possible
compensation
for him who renounces everything ."
Is it enough that in exchange
for his
person
and
property
a man
should
receive
an illusory
equivalent
in the
shape
of an infinitesimal
fraction
of the
in-
divisible
person
and
property
of others ?
Rousseau
apparently
thought
that
the
free
consent
of individuals
to
the
compact
sufficed
to justify
any
action
of the
community
so constituted .
But , in
Burke's
words ,
" liberty,
when
men
act
in
bodies ,
is
power."
Even the " natural
rights " to life and liberty , which
the
pact is
supposed
not to
infringe ,
are wholly
annihilated
.
In
brief, the unity to
be secured by the
alienation
of all to all is a
meaningless
abstraction .
The
State ,
said
Aristotle , is
not an
absolute
unity , but a collection
of individuals
specifically
differ-
ent .
Lastly,
Rousseau
contended
that
for a government
to be
legitimate
the people
should in each generation
have
the option
of accepting
or rejecting
it (I. 4) ; yet
he made no provision
for
this.
His
disciple
Jefferson
proposed
a renewal of the
constitu-
tion every nineteen
years .
Bluntschli
has
observed
that
the
social
compact
theory is
favourable
to anarchy , since it claims
universal
validity and makes
the rise and also the continuance
of States depend on an arbitrary
compact
among individuals, revocable
at will, for what the general
will has done it can undo
; but that the theory
has an element of
truth in accentuating
the fact that the human will
can determine

and
influence
the
formation
of the State .
It thus supplements
the half-truth
of Mackintosh that " constitutions
are not
made
but grow ."
M. Janet
and others have affirmed
that a social con
tract
has
actually
been made ; for
example , in
establishing
the
Swiss
Confederation
by the union of separate
provinces .
But
this process of federation
is quite different
from
Rousseau's
com-
pact among isolated
men living free in a state of nature .
7
Rousseau's doctrine
of property
is an integral
part of his theory.
In his second Discourse
he had anticipated
Proudhon's " property
is theft ."
In his article on Political Economy in the Encyclopædia ,
he
affirmed
that " the foundation
of the social compact
is pro-
perty ," and that the right of property is "the most
sacred of all
the rights of citizens , in some respects even
more important
than
liberty itself."
Similar views are expressed in Émile (Book V. ).
In the Social Contract
his position is again
changed .
The pact
is the basis
of all rights
in the
State , and by making
the
State
master of all that belongs to its members , it transforms
possession ,
which is only the
result
of force
and of the
right of first occu-
pancy , into property , which rests on a positive
title , the guarantee
of the
State .
Possession
does
not
become
property
in
the
sovereign's
hands , but the forces of the State being incomparably
greater than
those
of any individual , public
possession
is more
secure
and
irrevocable , though not
more
legitimate
as regards
foreigners .
The right of first occupancy
becomes
real only when
the right of property
is established .
Its justification depends
on
these conditions
: (a) that the land is uninhabited
; (6) that a man
occupies
only the
area
required
for his
subsistence
; (c) that he
takes possession of it not by an empty ceremonial , but by labour
and cultivation , the only sign of property that should
be respected
in default of juridical titles .
The social contract
converts usurpa-
tion into
true
right
and
renders
possessors
depositaries
of the
commonwealth
; and , in this way , by a cession advantageous both
to the public and to themselves
they acquire all that they gave up,
for their rights are respected by every one and guaranteed
against
* Cicero said (De Off., II . xxi . 73) that the security of private pro-
perty
was the chief
reason
for
the constitution
of
Republics
and
States.

foreigners by the

of
the State
.
Thus
the compact
converts possession
de
facto into possession
de
jure
;
the property
of individuals
becomes
the national
estate
,
and
their
continued
enjoyment
of
it
is
due
to
the tolerance
and recognition
of
the
State
.
Rousseau's
doctrine
is
clearly
not
communism
;
his ideal
appears
to
have
been
a
small
State
composed
of
peasant pro-
prietors
,
but the
complete
subordination
of
individual
rights
was held to
be
necessary
to
the stability
of
the social
union
.
Rousseau's
view
,
derived
from
Locke
,
that
ownership
rests on
first
occupancy
,
is
another
instance
of
the improper
transference
of modern
individualistic ideas
to
primitive men
,
joint ownership
by families
being
probably the archaic
form
.
Property
is
now
regarded
as
held and
regulated
with
reference
to
the
general
welfare
;
it
is
a
right
conferred
by law
,
and
includes
rights
of
possession
,
enjoyment
,
and
disposition
.*
In
a
note
Rousseau
observes
that the
social state
is
advantageous
to
men only
in
so
far as all have something
and none have too much
;
for otherwise
equality
is
only illusory
,
and the poor are kept
in
their
misery
and the rich
in
their usurpation
.
But
if,
as
we must suppose
,
the
State
is
entitled
to
dispose
of
property
,
it
may confiscate
exces-
sive wealth
in
order
to
secure greater equality
,
and foreknowledge
of this
might
deter
rich
men
from
entering
into the social
contract
.
(2)
Hobbes
regarded
the
sovereign
as
a
common
authority
,
established
by
a
compact
among
individuals
,
and invested with
all their
power
and
resources
;
while Locke
argued
that
the
supreme
authority
remains
in
the people
,
even after they have
established
a
government
.
According
to
Rousseau
,
sovereignty
is
the
absolute
power
which the
social contract
gives the body
politic over all
its
members
,
when this power
is
directed
by the
general will
,
that
is
,
by
the will
of
the
citizens
as
a
corporate
whole
(II
.
4).
The
sovereign
cannot
contract
with itself
,
and
therefore
cannot
be bound by law

hence no kind
of
fundamental
law
is

that
derogates
from the sanctity of the contract , such as aliena-
tion of part
of itself or submission
to another
sovereign .
Rous-
seau rightly
insists
on
the
double
aspect
of
sovereignty —
its
C
of
independence
of
external
control and
its
paramount
power over
all internal
action
.
The
sovereign
can
have no interests
anta-
gonistic
to
those
of
the citizens
composing
it,
and
consequently
needs no guarantee with reference
to
its subjects
;
for the
body
P
cannot
wish
to
injure
its
members
individually
or
collectively
.
"
The
sovereign
,
for the
simple
reason
that
it
is
so
,
is
always
be
everything
that
it
ought
to
be
."
The general will
,
however
,
which
co
always aims
at
the common good
,
cannot
be
durably
in
accord
with particular
wills
;
private
interests
may
be opposed
to
it,
and
SO
when
they
are
pursued
to
the
detriment
of civic
duties
the
t
State's
safety
is
imperilled
.
The
social
compact
tacitly involves
this
engagement
,
which alone
can
give
force
to
others
,
-that
whoever
refuses
to
obey the general
will shall
be constrained
to
S
do
so
by the whole body
,
in
other words
,
he shall
be forced
to
be
free
,
since
only on this condition can he be guaranteed
from all
personal
dependence
and civil engagements
rendered
legitimate
,
which would otherwise
be
"
absurd
,
tyrannical
,
and subject
to
the
most enormous
abuses
"
(I.
7).
Sovereignty
,
being
nothing
but the exercise
of
the general
will
,
can
never
be
alienated
.
If
the
people
submit
absolutely
to
a
master
,
sovereignty
ceases
to
exist
,
and the body politic
is
dis-
solved
.
Further
,
as
the sovereign
is
a
collective
being
,
it
can only
be
represented
by itself
;
power may be transmitted
but not will
.
Sovereignty
,
again
,
is
indivisible for the
same
reason
that
it
is
inalienable
,
and
those
who
divide
it
into legislative
power and
executive
power
take
as
parts
of
it
what
are only emanations
from
it,
for example
,
the rights
of taxation
and of justice
,
home
and
foreign
administration
,
etc.
(II
.
1,
2).
The sovereign power
,
in
short
,
is
incorruptible
,
inalienable
,
unrepresentable
,
indivisible
,
and
,
as
appears later
,
indestructible
.
Sovereignty
must
be
exercised
in
assemblies
of
the
whole
people
,
otherwise
there
is
no declaration
of
the general will
,
and
consequently
no freedom
.
Although the
general will
is
always
right and always
tends
to
public utility
,
the
people's
resolutions

have
not always the
same
rectitude
.
Men
always desire
their
own good
,
but
do
not always perceive
it;
the people are
never
corrupted
,
though
often deceived
.
This
is
in
reality an adaptation
of the
old
monarchical
maxim
that
the king can do no wrong
,
though he may
be misled
or
misinformed
.
Rousseau
insists that
the will of all
,
which
is
the sum
of
particular
wills
,
regards
only
private
interests
,
and therefore
differs
from
the
general
will
,
which
considers
only the common
interest
.
A will in order
to
be general
need
not be unanimous
,
but
every voice
should
be
it
is
the
common
interest
rather
than the number of
counted
;
voices which generalises
the
will
.
If
the
people
came
to
a
re-
solution on sufficient information
and without
intercommunication
,
the general will would
result and
the resolution
would
be always
good
.
But
,
as
particular
associations
,
pursuing
their own ends
,
may
prevent
this
,
they
should
be
forbidden
,
or
their number
should be multiplied
(II
.
3).
Rousseau
,
in
recurring
to
this subject
(
IV
.
1),
remarks
that
in
ill
-
constituted
States
private
interests
and small
associations
con-
flict with the
general
interest
,
and
the general will
is
no longer
the will
of
all
.
Nevertheless
,
the general will remains
pure and
unalterable
;
although
obscured
,
it
is
uncorrupted
and
inde-
structible
.
In
pursuing
their
private
interests
men
do
not
extinguish
the general will
in
themselves
but elude
it;
they
vote
,
not for what
is
beneficial
to
the State
,
but for what
is
advantageous
to
a
certain
man
or
party
.
Rousseau
does not say
,
however
,
that
unless
a
law actually
contributes
to
the public good
,
it
is
not an
expression of the general
will
.
Since
the State
is
a
moral
person
whose life
consists
in
the
union
of
its members
,
it
requires
a
universal
and compelling
force
to
move and dispose
each part
in
the manner
most expedient for
the whole
.
Now the life and liberty
of
its members
are naturally
independent
of
the sovereign
,
and we must
therefore
distinguish
the respective
rights
of
the citizens
and
the sovereign
,
and their
duties
as
subjects
from their natural rights
as
men
.
A man does
not alienate
to
the State all his power
,
property
,
and liberty
,
but
only
such
part
as the
community
requires
,
the
sovereign
alone
being judge
of
what
must be given up
.
Although
a
citizen
must


52
The Social Contract .
render
the sovereign
every
possible
service , the latter cannot,
under
the
law
of reason , impose
on subjects
any useless or un-
equal
burdens ,
or
favour
one
at the
expense
of others .
The
pledges binding us to the social
body are obligatory
only because
they
are
mutual , and
as in fulfilling them we
cannot
work for
others without
working
for ourselves , every man's natural tendency
to study his own interests
is satisfied
(II. 4 ) .
An act of sovereignty
is an authentic
declaration
of the general
will about an object of common
interest and
constitutes
law.
It
is a convention
, not between a superior
and
an inferior, but
be-
tween the body and each of its members ; legitimate , because based
on the social
contract ,
equitable , because common
to all,
useful ,
because it aims at the general
good , and
stable , because it has
for guarantee the supreme public force .
So long as they submit
to such conventions
only, the citizens
obey no will but their own,
and the rights of sovereign
and subjects
are coincident
.
Conse-
quently , the sovereign
power , absolute , sacred , and inviolable
as
it is, cannot
pass the limits of general
conventions
, and any man
can dispose fully of what those conventions
leave him
(II. 4 ) .
As
the social treaty aims at the
preservation
of
its
members
,
the life
of
each
is
a
conditional gift
of
the State
,
and
must
,
if
necessary
,
be sacrificed for the public welfare —
a
statement which
seems in-
consistent
with
Rousseau's
doctrine
that
in
civil
society
a
man
retains his natural right
to
life
(II
.
5).
Conventions
and
laws are necessary
to
secure
the administra-
tion
of
justice
,
and the civil law
is
therefore
essential
to
the pre-
servation
of the
State
.
It
fixes and guarantees
all rights
and
gives movement
and will
to
the body
politic
.
The
general
will
is
not
concerned
with
particular
objects
,
but
when
the whole
people
make
an
ordinance
about
the
whole
people
,
this act
is
called
a
law
.
Positive
laws
must be agreed
to
by all whom they
bind
,
or
they may become instruments
of
oppression
.
Moreover
,
the general
will
must
be
general
in
its
object
as
well
as
in
its
essence
.
An ordinance
of
the sovereign
about
a
particular
object
is
not
a
law but
a
decree
,
an
act not
of
sovereignty
but
of
magistracy
.
The
sovereign
may
indeed
establish
privileges
,
though
it
should not nominate
persons
to
them
.

properly only the conditions
of civil
association , and being
acts
of the general
will , they cannot
be unjust , for no
one is unjust
towards himself ; nor can they infringe
our liberty, since they are
simply registers of our will .
Hobbes
had argued that no law can
be unjust , because what is just is identical with what
the
sover-
eign commands .
As the
general
will is the true
sovereign , all
laws , including the compact
itself , are liable to revision
or repeal .
Every State
guided
by the
general
will , that
is , ruled
by laws
made in the general
assembly of citizens , is a republic , whatever
may be its form of administration
; for then only does the public
interest rule .
Thus even
hereditary
monarchy
is admissible
if it
can be made consonant
with popular
sovereignty
(II . 6).
In his treatment of laws Rousseau
makes an advance on Mont-
esquieu by distinguishing
between
a law of nature , which is merely
a uniformity , and a law of the State .
He did not, however , fully
realise all the
distinctive
attributes
of laws , and
comprehended
but imperfectly
the idea
of law as a command .
Hampered by
his notion of the
necessity
of consent
to whatever
binds indi-
viduals, he follows
the Sophists
in regarding
laws as conventions
between
the body and its members , and
bases their legitimacy
on
the social contract .
According to Austin * (who follows
Hobbes ),
every law is a command
or
expression
of the wish of the law-
giver, imposing
an obligation
on
the
citizen , and
threatening
a
sanction in case of disobedience
.
Austin
adds
that
a law pre-
scribes not a single act
but a series of acts or forbearances
of the
same kind , whereas a particular
command
obliges
to
specific
acts
or forbearances
;
but
he
admits
that
usage is
opposed
to this
sharp division .
Rousseau
lays
exaggerated
stress on
generality
and treats particular
commands
or decrees
as pertaining
only to
the government , and not
to the sovereign
or legislative
power , so
that the choice
of a king or dynasty would not
be a legislative
act.
Yet the English
Act
of
Settlement
is always
held to be a
law, and
private bills occupy
much of the attention
of the House
of Commons
.
In England , too , even high judicial decisions
may
be sources of law.
Rousseau's
argument
that magisterial
decrees
*Jurisprudence

The Social Contract.
are not acts of sovereignty
(II. 6 ) appears inconsistent
with
his
declaration
that
the orders of chiefs may
pass as general wills
so
long as the sovereign refrains
from opposing
them
(II. 1).
Rousseau
at length
begins
to harbour
doubts concerning the
inherent
wisdom of the multitude , and
perceives
that
an unen-
lightened
people , blindly groping
after
their
own
good , require
guidance
in the difficult task
of legislation
; they need the aid
of a Moses
or a Lycurgus to interpret
and
express the
general
will (II . 6).
The legislator , or , more correctly , constitution
-maker,
must
be an extraordinary
man both by genius
and
office ; he is
no part of the
constitution - neither
sovereign
nor magistrate-
but the founder
of it.
He
who
frames
institutions
for a people
must feel able , as it were , to change
human
nature , to
substitute
a social and moral
existence
for a natural
and
physical
one , to
weld
individuals into
a strong
and
lasting
community
(II . 7).
Rousseau
could
not
see that
institutions , if they are to be of any
utility, must spring
immediately
from the needs and circumstances
of the people , and must be the result of a slow growth instead of
being suddenly
imposed
by an external act . "A true politician ,"
said Burke,* " always
considers
how he shall
make the
most of
the existing
materials of his country ."
Later on , indeed , Rousseau
allows , with Montesquieu, that
laws
must
be
adapted
to the
character
of the
people , and
to
geographical
position , soil, and
climate
(II. 8,
11 ) , an
admission , however ,
which
is clearly at
variance with his doctrine
of the indefinite
modifiability
of human
nature in the hands of a legislator .
In
postulating
the necessity
of an ideal
law-giver
he pays
extravagant
homage
to antiquated
ideas .
The example of Calvin , as well
as that of the
semi -his-
torical
Moses , Lycurgus, and
Numa,
probably
induced
him to
suggest
a method
so utterly
alien to modern
notions .
Rousseau
dwells upon the disadvantages
of large States .
Their
administration
is not only difficult
and
costly , but
ineffective
in
reforming
abuses and enforcing
laws .
A territory peopled
uni-
formly, abundance , and equal rights
are the essentials of a strong
and good government .
The nation
best
fitted
for legislation
is

one in which the people
have
some bond of origin , interest , or
convention , one in which customs
and
superstitions
are not deep-
rooted , one which is large and strong
enough
to
subsist
without
external aid , and yet small enough
for all the members
to know
one another , stable yet docile , neither
too rich nor too poor, but
self-sufficing .
What
renders
the work of legislation
difficult is
not so much what
has
to
be established
as
what
has to
be de-
stroyed.
This is an echo of Rousseau's
second
Discourse , and it
is the very key -note of modern
radicalism .
If success
is rare , he
continues, it is owing to the impossibility of finding the simplicity
of nature
conjoined
with the
necessities
of society
(II.
9,
10 ;
III. 15).
The greatest good , which is the end of every system of legisla
tion , consists
in liberty and
equality .
Equality , without
which
liberty cannot
subsist , does not
mean
that the degrees of power
and wealth
should
be absolutely
the same, but that power should
only be exercised
by virtue of rank
and
according
to law, while
no one should
be rich
enough to buy another
nor
poor
enough
to be forced
to sell himself.
Great
inequalities
pave the way for
tyranny (II. II).
Liberty and equality , then , are the starting -point as well as the
goal of Rousseau's
theory ;
they are realised
alike in the state of
nature , in which men have no bond of union , and in civil
society
in which all are
unified by the
sovereign
power . "The sover-
eignty of the multitude
is only individual
sovereignty
multiplied
by itself, the sovereignty
of each , or liberty , being limited by the
sovereignty
of others , or
equality ."
But the
terms
assume
a
somewhat
different
meaning
when
used
of civil
society .
The
· liberty and equality
of the second
Discourse
are not those of the
Social
Contract .
In the
former
they
have
a
meaning
largely
negative , liberty
being absence
of restraint
by a superior
power ,
and
equality
absence
of preference
among
individuals
together
with the
positive
existence
of equal
" natural
rights ."

The Social Contract.
""
latter , all citizens
are supposed
to
retain
their " natural rights
and to be civilly and politically free and
equal in virtue of com-
mon laws .
But, as
we
have
seen, Rousseau
does
not demand
absolute
equality of wealth and rank , although
he seems to suggest
the removal
of any great inequalities
in these respects .
Equality
therefore
means something
more than the
equality
before the law
and equality
in political rights , which follow from
the social com-
pact , though
to claim
even
these
latter
kinds of equality
was a
distinctive
merit
in an age of feudal
privileges
and distinctions .
Those, however , who
go so far
as to charge
Rousseau
with
preaching
that
men
are
equal
in
intellect
and
strength , or that
they ought
to be
perfectly
equal
in rank
and
wealth , are false
witnesses whom
the Social
Contract puts to confusion .
From the
freedom
and equality
of all partakers
in the
sovereign
power, it
was inferred
that all
men form
a
social
brotherhood
, and
hence
we obtain the famous triad of " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity."
In reasoning
against
large
States , Rousseau
supposes a com-
munity of 10,000 citizens , each of whom is to be regarded
as the
possessor of one ten -thousandth
part
of the sovereign
authority ,
while
he is
entirely
subjected
to it.
If a
State
has
100,000
citizens , each of these
possesses
ten
times
less influence
than a
citizen of the former
State ; accordingly
, as the State is
enlarged ,
liberty is diminished
(III . 1) .
In this
argument
liberty is con-
founded
with
sovereignty , and both
are
assumed
to
vary
with
population
.
The absurdity
of this contention
is easily shown by
the consideration
that , on Rousseau's
view , a Swiss citizen of to-
day would
possess
about
thirteen
times
as
much
freedom
and
sovereign
power as a British citizen .
Rousseau's
argument
illus-
trates at once his exaggerated individualism , his imperfect
grasp
of the true conception
of sovereignty , and the dangers of his rigid
mathematical
method .
The sovereign , having
no other force than the legislative
power ,
acts only through
the laws , and
since
laws
are simply
acts of the
general will , the sovereign
can only act
when
the
whole
people
are assembled .
This
may seem
chimerical
, but
what
existed
in
Rome
may
exist
now
(III .
12 ) .
Mr.
Morley
remarks
that
Rousseau
might
have adverted
to the assemblies
held in Uri and

Appenzell in his own day .*
He was in reality
taking
Geneva
as
a pattern .
In his
Letters from
the Mountain
(VI.) he
mentions
that he adopted it as the model
of his
political
institutions
, but
not without introducing
amendments
of his own
based
upon
ancient
republics .
In
dedicating
his
second
Discourse
to the
"sovereign lords " of the republic
of Geneva
(the
excellences
of
which
he
greatly
magnified
while
disregarding
its
oligarchical
abuses ), he had
affirmed
that all the
best
principles
of govern-
ment were applied
in that city ;
the State
had no need of repre-
sentatives , and all functions
of government
were delegated
to the
magistrates
by the sovereign
assembly .
But
Rousseau
also kept
before his mind the assemblies of Sparta and
Rome, and
Plato's
ideal State certainly
influenced
him .
Plato , in fact , with his small
and unified State and
his severe
Spartan
ideal , haunts
Rousseau
throughout.
The people
must
not only fix a State -constitution
by enacting
a body of laws ; they must also establish
a perpetual
government ,
provide for periodical assemblies
which cannot
be
abolished
or
prorogued, and regulate the mode of convoking all other
assem-
blies. It is always an evil to combine
several cities into one State ;
large States are liable
to abuses , and
therefore
Rousseau
desires
none but small
ones , which are stronger in proportion
, and will ,
as in former times , be able
to
resist
more
powerful
neighbours .
Where several cities are combined
in one
State no capital
should
be allowed (III . 13 ) .
Rousseau
has to show
how a system of
city -states can be formed
so as to unite the good
order
and
real
sovereignty
of a
small
State
with the
extensive
territory and
external
power of a large
modern
State .
He
proposed
to com-
plete his theory by demonstrating
how small
States
can defend
themselves
by federation , somewhat
in the fashion
of the present
Swiss
Confederation
, but his work on this subject
was never
pub-
lished .
He
commended
, however , a system
of
federal
govern-
ments to the Poles on the ground
that it combined
the advantages

walden , Glarus , and Appenzell

The Social Contract.
of large
and
small
States .
It is
not
clear
whether
Rousseau
entertained
the
fantastic
idea
of resolving
Europe into
a vast
number
of small
and
independent
, but
federated , communes ,
which
appears to be the aim of anarchist
communists
to-day .
England
has
shown
how it
is possible
to decentralise
the
ad-
ministration
of a large
State , and ,
by organising
a network
of
local governments , to
secure
all the
real
advantages
at which
Rousseau
aimed .
Rousseau's
preference for small
States is a main
characteristic
of his work ; and , taken
in conjunction
with
his theory
of the
incommunicability of the general
will, it explains
his opposition
to representation
.
A body of magistrates
cannot
declare
them-
selves
to be
representatives
of
the
people
except
through
usurpation
or deception
; they can be nothing
more than limited
agents
whose
acts
require
ratification
by a general
assembly
of
citizens .
Representation
is the outcome of incivism
and political
abuses , of conquests
and
the vast
size of States .
So soon as
a
people appoint
representatives
they cease to be free , and lose the
exercise of their sovereign
rights .
The English system of repre-
sentation
is an illusion, for the people
are mere
slaves of the
Parliament , except
at election
time ; in
fact , few , if any, nations
have true laws for want of a proper
declaration
of the general
will
(III. 15 ) . It appears in his Letters from the Mountain (VII .) that
Rousseau
considered
that England had lost her
liberty through
neglecting
to
renew
the
House
of
Commons
with
sufficient
frequency ; the Court, he
said , would be exhausted if it had to
bribe
a new Parliament
every
year .
As
Rousseau , however ,
admits that the people
cannot
be incessantly
assembled , represen-
tation is the only practicable
system in States
larger
than
city-
states of the Greek type .
The demand
that every law should
be
approved
in person by those whom
it is to bind
is another result
of his uncompromising
individualism
, which here
shows
itself
hopelessly
unworkable
.
In truth , citizens
renounce
none of their
rights in appointing
representatives , for they can limit the latter's
power and tenure
of office , and
revoke or modify
the
mandates
they have given .
Frequent elections would
secure the necessary
harmony
between
electors
and
their
representatives .
In great

L
modern nations
representation
serves to combine
true liberty with
sufficient
unity ; and it has the
further
advantage of intermixing
aristocratic
with democratic
elements , for, although
the sovereign
power still rests ultimately
with the people , it
is temporarily
dele-
gated to chosen persons whose experience , knowledge
, or aptitude
for legislative
work enables
them to handle
complex
affairs more
wisely than an
untrained
and unleisured
general
assembly .
In
his Government
of Poland Rousseau
approves
of representatives
on condition that they receive an
imperative
mandate
from their
constituents
, and render
an account
of their
stewardship
.
But
in the Social
Contract
he
makes
no such
concession , and
even
refers
to the system of slavery , by which leisure for the political
activity of the
citizens
was
secured
in ancient
States , as merely
one of the unfortunate
inconveniences
of civil society .
He adds
equivocally that
he does not advocate
slavery , but
simply wishes
to point out that modern
nations , which have no slaves , are them-
selves
enslaved by their representatives
.
In
accordance
with
Locke's doctrine
that nothing
can make a
man a member of a commonwealth
but an express promise upon
entering it, Rousseau
holds
that the social contract
alone requires
unanimity, for no
one
can
subject
a
man
without
his
assent .
Opponents of the compact
do not nullify it, but , being
excluded
from it, they remain
as foreigners
among the citizens .
When the
State is established
consent
lies in residence , unless circumstances
detain a
man
against
his will ; for if a society
guarantees
his
person and
property
he is morally bound to accept the laws of
the sovereign
power (IV. 2).
But is not this an abandonment
of
the doctrine
of obligation
as based
on consent ?
And if a man
objects to the decision
of the
majority , would
he
not have a
"natural right " to
refuse
obedience
?
Locke * more
correctly
affirmed
that
a man
may submit
to the administration
without
formally becoming
a member
of the society ; and on this ground
foreigners
who commit crimes in our territory are held amenable
to
our tribunals . If mere
acquiescence
in
a government
were
sufficient , we might be forced
to acquiesce
in a bad one , and in

The Social Contract .
that
case every government
actually
submitted
to would
be law-
ful.
Moreover, the
majority
of people
could
not get away from
an
ill
-
governed
country
,
although
Rousseau
,
like
Grotius
,
admits
that they are entitled
to
relinquish
it.
On his principles
,
in
short
,
the most
thorough
despotism
,
if
once established
,
might claim to
rest on free consent just
as
much
as
a
popular
government
;
and
this
is
manifestly
at
variance with
his
position
that
sovereignty
,
resting
solely on the
people's
consent
,
can
have no
power
over
those who refuse consent
.
Except
in
the original
contract
,
the vote
of
the majority
always
binds the rest
.
But how can
a
man
be free
and
yet bound by
laws he has not assented to
?
A
citizen
,
replies
Rousseau
,
really
consents
to
all the laws
,
even
to
those passed
in
spite
of
him
;
for
the members of the State
are citizens
and
freemen through the
general
will
,
and
when
a
law
is
proposed
in
the assembly
,
they
are not asked whether they approve
or
reject
it,
but whether
it
is
conformable
or
not
to
the
general will
,
in
which they share
,
and
which
is
ascertained
by the counting
of votes
.
Assemblies
do
not ensure that the general will shall be maintained
,
but only that
it
shall
always be
consulted
and
always respond
.
The more the
voting approaches
unanimity
,
the more
is
the general
will pre-
dominant
.
If
my own opinion does not prevail
,
this
only shows
that
I
was mistaken
as
to
the general will
,
and
if
it
had prevailed
,
I
should
have
done something
other than
I
wished
,
and
should
therefore not have been
free
.
If
the majority does not possess
the
marks of the general
will
,
liberty
is
of
course
absent
.
For
important resolutions
a
large majority
should
be
required
;
where
despatch
is
necessary
,
a
bare majority
suffices
*
(
IV
.
1,
2).
In short
,
the people
alone
are the true and original sovereign
,
and the general will
is
the sole source
of
law
;
to
use the Roman
formula
:
Uti populus jusserit ita lex esto
.
In modern
republics
(
for
example
,
the United
States
),
the Constitution
serves
as
a
check on rapid
or
revolutionary
changes
,
but
Rousseau
provides
no safeguard
against
the
temporary
aberrations
of
the sovereign
*
In his Government of Poland Rousseau
requires unanimity for
a
change
in
fundamental laws affecting the existence
of
the body politic
,
while
a
strong majority suffices for changes
in
political forms
.

what like a Magna Carta , which should

and

That the sovereign
is irresponsible
and absolute
in the State must be allowed , but experience
has proved
that the
general
welfare
is best attained
by exempting
from the operation
of law a portion of the individual's interests , and
a Constitution
may usefully
indicate
what
is reserved .
Precisely what
liberties
should be conceded
is a perennial
question to be decided
differ-
ently in different
ages, countries , and circumstances
.
Mazzini ,†
who rightly regarded
liberty
only as a means to
a higher
end ,
enumerated
as indispensable

; liberty
of labour ,
trade, and
locomotion
;
liberty
of
religious
faith ;
liberty
of
opinion
on all
subjects , and of free expression
of such opinions
by any peaceful
means ; and
liberty
of association .
But Rous-
seau , like Hobbes, places
even religion under the tyranny of the
sovereign .
His whole
system , indeed , is " inverted
Hobbism ,"
the
many -headed
multitude
supplanting
the
despotic
monarch .
Rousseau's
ground
for vesting everything
in the State is, that if
some fact or right not regulated
by an anterior
general convention
were
in
dispute , there
would be
no
common
judge
to
decide
between
the sovereign
and
a private individual , and
the state of
nature
would
still
subsist .
But in
modern
States
it
is found
possible
to allow
extensive
liberties
to the individual , and
the
State may even consent , as an act of grace , to engage in litigation
with its subjects .
Rousseau , however , could not conceive
any union of social and
individual
liberty which
did not involve the total
suppression
of
the one or the other .
This
was evident
in Émile .
He
wished
in the spirit of Locke to devise a system by which natural liberty

The Social Contract .
should be guaranteed , while to secure political unity he provided
in the spirit of Hobbes for the total
alienation
of the individual
and all his rights
in return for civil
liberty , which meant in effect
absolute
subjection
to
a body of laws
enforced
by the whole
power of the State .
Thus there
is a fundamental
contradiction
in
Rousseau's
system ; his narrow
individualism perpetually
con-
flicts with his overweening
desire for complete
political unity, and
he finds it
impossible
to bridge
the chasm
that divides the free
natural
man , whose liberty
he would fain preserve , from
the civil
man
whom
the
compact
has transfigured
and
adapted
to
social
life.
Rousseau's
system turns
out to be imperious
and despotic ;
he imposes
civism
under the pretext
of guaranteeing
personal
rights , and he compels
men to
be free just as Calvin compelled
them
to
be
religious .
We
have
seen that
Rousseau
becomes
frightened
at the unlimited
power he confers on the State , and
endeavours
to except
" natural
rights " from
the
sphere
of
its
influence
.
But
in
vain does he endeavour
to
restrain on the plea
of conventions
the absolute
sovereign
he has
created
;
inexorable
logic forces him
to
conclude
that
the sovereign
alone must
judge
what rights
the individual should
retain
.
Thus
his distinction
between the respective
rights
of
the sovereign
and the citizens
is
a
pretence
,
as
he
seems
to
admit
later on
(II
.
4
adfin
.).
It
is
his
emphasis
on
personality
that
causes
Rousseau to
exaggerate
the unity
of
the nation
as
a
collective
and
sovereign
person controlling all the
interests
of
life under
the guidance
of
the general
will
.
In this respect
he
follows closely
his favourite
models
.
Sparta
was
organized
into
a
solid
political
phalanx
;
early Rome
,
"
that model
of
all free peoples
,"
had
the unity and
stern
discipline
of
a
legion
;
while the Geneva of Calvin
,
whose
exclusive
political
institutions
Rousseau
greatly
admired
,
was
a
kind of Christian Sparta
.
The ascendency
of
an aristocratic
caste
and the complete
subordination
of
the individual
to
the
State
were features common
to
all these republics
.
Rousseau's
austere
ideal was not merely
a
result of his training
and
education
as
a
Genevan
citizen
;
it
was
congenial
to
his narrow
emotional
dis-
position
.
Moreover
,
he
was
unable
to
discern
the
course
of
historical
evolution
or
to
recognise
the desirability
of free indi-

.
Wholly
ignoring the
continuity between
modern and
earlier
societies
,
he cut himself off altogether
from
the
immediate
past
.
He
wished
rather
to
revive
the
homo-
geneity
,
coherence
,
and unity which marked
the
ancient
States
,
whose artificial
constitutions
,
based on slavery
,
are quite unsuited
to modern
conditions
.
His ideal
State
is
stereotyped
;
all must
conform
to this
one
standard
,
deviation
from
which implies
degradation
.
In brief
,
Rousseau
disregards
or
despises the com-
plexity of modern
societies
,
in
which
numerous
citizens
exercise
extremely
varied
functions
,
and
in
which
a
real
solidarity
is
rendered
possible
only by
an
elaborate
co
-
operation
among
individuals
.
Such
differentiation
seemed
a
fatal
defect to Rous-
seau
;
what we call progress was
to
him retrogression
.
It
was partly
his
zeal for unity and partly
a
remnant
of
his
respect for natural
goodness that made him oppose intercommuni-
cation
when
a
true
expression
of
the
general
will
is
desired
.
Men
,
he assumes
,
in
opposition
to
experience
,
are more
likely
to
decide rightly by appealing
to
their natural
instincts
than by free
and
rational
discussion
.
He
therefore
distrusts
all
particular
associations
(
e.g.
churches
or
parlements
)
whose
power
may
destroy the factitious
unity
of
the State
,
or
seriously
menace the
sovereignty
.
His reference
is
sweeping
enough
to
include poli-
tical parties such
as
now exist
in
all
constitutional
States
.
It is
obvious
,
however
,
that
without
organisation
and
discussion
com-
plex
questions
cannot
be properly
investigated
and
determined
.
Rousseau
should
have seen that
a
strong
representation
of
classes
and interests
is
the most effectual
check
on tyranny
,
and
that
it
was the complete
destruction
of
national
and local bodies which
had enabled
the French monarchy
to
become absolute
.
But
he
felt implicit
confidence
in
his
sovereign
assembly
,
and
would
tolerate
no divisions
.
It
does
not
appear
to
have
occurred
to
him that
a
majority
,
under the pretext
of
forcing
men
to
be free
,
could abuse their power
,
and
produce
even greater disasters than
the most self
-
seeking
of
particular
associations
.
Rousseau
,
in
fact
,
could not get rid
of
Hobbes's
conception
of
sovereignty
as
a
supreme
coercive
power
,
although
he
strove
to
dissemble
its
despotism
by identifying
the
general
will with the

vote ofthe majority .
But though
a majority may be conceived as
a coercive
power , a general will in the sense of an unselfish
interest
in the common
good
cannot
be
so conceived
; " power
may be
transmitted
but
not will ."
And
thus
for the sovereignty
of the
general will we get the sovereignty of a majority of particular wills .
Rousseau
said expressly that the general will differs from the will
of all ; but unless the sum ofindividual interests forms the common
interest
his
system
is
a failure .
Again , his
argument
that
the
general
will is always just
and
necessarily
desires
the
common
good (with its corollary
that no law can be unjust ), although it is
a fallacious
deduction
from the assumption
that no one wishes to
injure or be unjust
to
himself ,
clearly
implies
that the sum
of
particular
wills
does constitute
the general
will .
Thus
we
get a
sovereignty of mere numbers , and , as Bluntschli *
remarks ,
the
sovereignty of the people
as a sum of individuals
is
anarchy and
incompatible
with
any
constitution
;
for
even
in
an absolute
democracy
it is the ordered
national
assembly , and not the crowd
of atoms , that exercises authority
in the
State .
The general will
which
Rousseau
supposes to consist in the common
elements
of
particular
wills is in reality a mere abstraction
; for opposing wills
may not cancel one another , or factions
may prevail , or ,
even if
the general will is always right , as he dogmatically
affirms , patriotic
citizens
may err from
want of enlightenment
; and in all such cases
the object of the general will , viz. the common
good, is unrealised .
Rousseau
does not indicate
how the general
will is in
any exact
sense determinable
; he refers to the marks of it without enumer-
ating them , though we may perhaps infer from various observations
that unanimity , the absence of particular
associations , the posses-
sion of adequate information
, and the fact
that
the public welfare
is being actively
pursued are the outward
and visible
signs of its
exercise .
But Rousseau
has to admit
that in practice
we can only
count the heads of absolute
and mutable
majorities , in which case
his distinction
between the general will and the sum of particular
wills completely
vanishes ; for his
representation
that
a
member
of the minority , as such , must be mistaken
about the
general
will

is a mere
subterfuge
resorted
to in
a
desperate
effort
to
save
consistency
.
The majority , then , has absolute
right ,
because
its
decisions, being the
true
interpretation
of the general
will , are
always
just and
morally
obligatory .
Such
a
position , however ,
is clearly untenable ; it is the paradox of Spinoza
that the right of
the supreme
authority
is proportionate
to its power , and
that
its
power being absolute
its
right
is
also
absolute
.
The right
of
the
majority
to
bind the minority
is
deduced
by Rousseau
from
the
original
pact
,
which required
unanimity
.
In
strict
consistency
,
however
,
he
should
have
demanded
unanimous
assent
to
every
measure
,
for
if
deputies
cannot
represent
a
people
,
the
majority
cannot represent the minority
.
Moreover
,
if
a
man has
a
natural
right
to
disregard
any law which he has not agreed
to
as
a
member
of
a
general assembly
,
there seems no valid
reason why
he
should
not disregard the decision
of
a
majority
opposed
to
his own opinion
,
at
any rate
if
he
is
convinced
that they are self
-
seekers
.
Throughout
,
Rousseau
is
perpetually
embarrassed
by his
con-
fusion
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
.
His sovereign
power
,
which
imposes
no
useless
burdens
,
injures
none
of
its
subjects
,
and always aims impartially
at
the common
good without
prejudice
to
individual
interests
,
is
an ideal
.
But when
he
pro-
ceeds
to
identify sovereignty
with the general will
,
and the general
will with the will
of
the majority
,
as
ascertained
by the
counting
of votes
,
we perceive how rapid
is
the transition
from the ideal
to
the actual
,
how easy the lapse into fallacy
.
The
true
reasons for
submission
to
the will
of
a
majority
are that the
majority
are
most likely
to
discern
and aim
at
the common
well
-
being
,
and that
,
as
they possess superior
force
,
no
other
mode
of
government
is
practicable
.
Further
,
wherever individuals have certain
common
ends
in
view
,
expediency
demands
that
,
after
unrestricted
dis-
cussion
,
the minority should yield
;
to
require
absolute
unanimity
would render legislation
difficult
or
impossible
.
But
it
is
indis-
pensable
that the
majority
should
tolerate
free
expression
of
contrary opinions
.
Reforms usually
originate
with
a
few enthusi-
asts
,
whose energy and activity
,
as
in
the campaign
against slavery
,
may ultimately
triumph over the
indifference
or
opposition
of
a
great number
.
We must remember
,

majority
is secured for a law, it may not express
the general
will ,
for many persons may remain
honestly
opposed
to it.
According
to Austin,*
sovereignty
resides in a determinate
person or persons , and
to
this
common
superior , who
must
be
independent
of any other superior , the bulk of the given
society
must be in habitual
obedience , the
essence of sovereignty
being
unlimited
power over those
in
subjection
to it.
On
Rousseau's
theory the general will resides , not in determinate
persons , but
in
the
majority
of an
assembly
of citizens ,
whose
vote
does
not
necessarily
express
the
general
will , or even
give
a power
of
X
compulsion
.
T. H.
Green
suggested that the truest
notion
of
sovereignty
is
reached
by
regarding
Rousseau's
and
Austin's
theories
as complementary
.
In his view , obedience
is
rendered
to a determinate
superior because he is regarded
as expressing
the
general
will , and
obedience
is
virtually
conditional upon
this .
The superior's
power
of compulsion
is
not
unbounded
,
and
its
exercise depends
on his conformity
to
certain
convictions
on
the
subjects
'
part
as
to
what
is
for the general
interest
.
If
this be
so
,
the power
of
the ostensible
sovereign
is
exercised with the people's
assent
,
which assent
is
not reducible
to
a
conscious
fear
of the
supreme
coercive
power
,
but
to
a
common desire for certain
ends
(
especially
peace
and
security
)
to
which law
-
observance
con-
tributes
.
Hence
a
people
or
peoples
(
e.g. the
natives
of
India
),
without
having any affection
for their rulers
,
may
at
least quietly
acquiesce
in
the sovereignty
.
It
is
the desire for common
objects
which
is
the
indispensable
condition
of
the existence
of
real
sovereign
power
,
and
if
this desire
,
which we
may regard
as
the
general
will
,
should
conflict
with the
sovereign's
commands
,
habitual
obedience
will also
cease
.
Nor does it
suffice that
a
majority
can
temporarily
impose
its will
;
true
laws
must
be
habitually
recognised
and
permanently
enforced
.
Except
,
how-
ever
,
in
times
of
great
popular
excitement
,
the
general
will
can
only be roughly ascertained
by consulting
the
organs of public
opinion
,
or
by finding out
in
a
tentative
way what the
people will
tolerate
.

Introduction

The
sovereign
power
is the
essential
thing in
a
State ,
and
Rousseau supposed
that it was established
by a compact
in
order
to
guarantee
impartially
certain
rights , freedom
of action
and
acquisition , which only occasionally
need the support of a coercive
power .
The sovereign
power , however , is not itself the
general
will nor a mere
coercive
force , but the agent for realising
the
= general
will , and in proportion
as it
does
this it
commands
habitual obedience .*
Further , political
institutions
may be held
to express and
depend
on the general
will ,
while
laws
may be
regarded as maintaining
rights in accordance
with it.
When the
coercive feature of sovereignty
becomes prominent
, the implication
is that the general interest in maintaining
equal rights
has lost its
I hold on the people , or that
the
sovereign
no
longer
fulfils
its
function
in
preserving
these rights
.
In short
,
individual rights depend
on relation
to
a
society
,
and
only
as
the organ
of
the general
interest
can the popular vote
endow any law with
a
right
to
obedience
.
To ask why
I
am to
submit to the State
,
says
Green
,
is
to
ask
why
I
am
to
allow my
life
to
be regulated
by that complex
of
institutions
without which
I
have no life
to
call my own
.
Freedom
of
action
and acquisition
can only be secured
through
mutual
recognition
of
this freedom
by members
of
the society
as
being for
a
common
good
.
While
the State
is
merely regarded
as
an aggregate of individuals under
a
sovereign
power which can compel
their
obedience
,
and while
this compulsive
power
is
considered
as
the characteristic
thing
in
a
State
,
no true conception
of the rights of individuals
in
relation
to one another
or
to
the State
is
possible
.
On
such
a
view the
question
as
to
the sovereign's right
to
enforce
obedience
on
indi-
viduals can only be met by some device for representing
individual
rights
as
derived
from the sovereign
,
and
therefore
as
having
no
existence
against
it
.
But unless the sovereign
power
is
exercised
against
the will
of
individuals
,
its
characteristic
as
a
compulsive
power would
be lost
,
it
would not
be
a
sovereign
power
.
As we
*
Hume said
in
his essay of the First Principles
of Government
:
"
As force
is
always on the side
of
the governed
,
the governors
have
nothing
to
support them but opinion
It
is,
therefore
,
on opinion only
that the government
is
founded
.'

The Social Contract .
have
seen , the
majority
cannot , on
Rousseau's
theory, justly
exercise
power
on
behalf
of an unconsenting
minority, for the
representation
that
the
minority
virtually consent
by the
social
contract
always to be bound
by the
majority
is clearly fictitious.
On the other hand , the theory
that all right
is
derived
from the
sovereign's
power reduces right to might , and obedience
is claimed
by the sovereign
as a power .
The truth is that
only so
far
as a
government
represents to them a common
good are subjects
con-
scious that they ought to obey it,
though
Rousseau
confounded
this with the proposition
that no government
can claim
obedience
unless it originates
in a general assembly of the people .*
Hegel considered
that Rousseau's
great work was to base every-
thing on will ; for not only did
he
conceive
the
State
to
be a
product of the wills of the parties
to the social
pact , but also re-
garded it as maintained
by their will and consent , since sovereignty
resides in the general will .
Green
also held that the permanently
valuable thing in Rousseau
was his
conception
of sovereignty
as
representing
a general will and on that account
entitled
to obedi-
ence .
As he remarked , however , the doctrine would have justified
rebellion in any Continental State of the
time ; for to Rousseau
the general will was sovereign
de jure, and therefore he would have
recognized
in ordinary
States only sovereigns
de facto , the
true
sovereigns
being
dormant
or suppressed .
The only system
really
fulfilling his conditions
(including active participation
in legislation
by the whole
body of citizens ) would be
one of small self-govern-
ing communes .
ingAn important
omission
should
be
noted
in connection with
* The above remarks on the general will are largely founded
upon
T. H. Green's Lectures on Political
Obligation
included in his Works
(vol . II .).
An interesting
attempt
to place the theory of the general
will on a philosophical
basis has been made by Dr. Bosanquet
in
an
article on "The Reality
of the
General Will " in the International
Journal ofEthics (April , 1894).
He considers the general will to be
"the whole assemblage of individual
minds considered
as
a working
system
with parts corresponding
to one another , and producing
as a
result a certain life for all these parts themselves."
On this view the
general will cannot be identified with the decision
of a community
by
vote on any single issue, nor with public opinion .
T

Rousseau's theory
of sovereignty .
He has
strangely
neglected
the tribunal, on which Locke laid so much
emphasis .
In
early
societies ,
as Maine
has shown ,* the
chief duty of a king
was
not
legislation , but the
decision
of law-suits in accordance
with
custom or primitive
law.
Supreme
legislative
assemblies
have
been the exception
rather than the rule throughout
the historical
period .
With the tribunal the State began , and so long
as States
endure , tribunals
must
exist
to
interpret
and
enforce
the
laws .
Yet Rousseau , though
he speaks of the institution
of the State as
a means for securing
justice
between man and man , never
assigns
a definite
place to the judicial
power
in the
constitution
of the
State .
In adverting
to the
execution
of criminals , he
says that
they should be slain as foes because they have broken the compact ,
which is a very
different
conception
from that
which
underlies
rational punishment
inflicted
for the general
welfare .
(3) In the body politic we must
distinguish
the legislative
or
sovereign
power
from the executive
power , which is only exerted
in particular
acts . This is Rousseau's
adaptation of Montesquieu's
division of powers .
The former cannot
govern
directly, and
the
government
is a subordinate , ministerial
body, distinct from , and
intermediate
between , the subjects
and the
sovereign , established
for their mutual
correspondence
, and charged with the
execution
of the laws and the
maintenance
of liberty.
The
government ,
then, exists through
the sovereign , and is the agent or commission
which concentrates
in itself the public force and exerts
it in pur-
suance of the directions
of the legislature .
The individuals
en-
trusted with the government
are called
magistrates , and the body
of magistrates
as a whole
is called the Prince .
Since they exercise
power as depositaries
only, the sovereign
can
limit, modify,
or
resume
it
at
pleasure .
If the
legislative
encroaches
on the
executive , or conversely , or if the
subjects
refuse
obedience ,
the
State is dissolved , and
anarchy
or despotism
supervenes .
Should
the
executive
successfully
exercise
its will in
opposition
to the
legislative , there are two sovereigns , the one de facto and the other
de jure (III.
1).

The Social Contract .
The
principle
of
sovereignty
is
everywhere
the
same ,
but
different
(executive ) governments
may
be
suitable
for different
nations
according
to circumstances .
The force ofthe government
should
be
increased
as population
increases ,
and it should be
greatest where the magistrates
are most
capable
of abusing their
power .
Assemblies ,
rights ,
titles ,
and
privileges , which
render
the
magisterial
position
more
honourable ,
are
necessary
to
endow
the
government
with
a personality ,
a will , a
common
feeling ,
and
a
real
life
of
its
own
(III .
1) .
This
illustrates
how far Rousseau
has advanced
beyond
his
doctrine
of a
state
of nature .
The
more
numerous
the
magistrates
are, the
weaker
is the
government
; therefore the most
active
government
is that of a
single person .
As the force
employed
by the magistrates
is the
whole force
of the State , which Rousseau
improperly
assumes to
be constant , the
government
acquires
no
greater
force
by the
multiplication
of magistrates .
Indeed , they should
be diminished
as population
increases
so as to secure the greatest force ; but to
secure the greatest rectitude , the magistracy
should
be increased ,
for by this
means
the
corporate
will is
made
to
approach
the
general will (III . 2).
A
government
is
called
a
democracy ,
an
aristocracy , or a
monarchy , according
as it is conducted
by a majority or a minority
of the people or by a single magistrate
; and there are also mixed
forms
(III . 3 ).
In this division
Rousseau's
special and
unusual
restriction
of the term government
to the
executive
power
tends
to confuse
his
readers .
Democracy
and
the
other
terms
have
generally
been
used to
denote political constitutions
, which
in-
clude both the legislative
and the executive .
This
is their mean-
ing in Hobbes and Montesquieu
, who
perceived
that sovereignty
is manifested
as
clearly
in the
executive and the judiciary
as in
the legislative .
On Rousseau's
view the
President of the United
States would be a limited
monarch .
Moreover, his division
of
governments
on
the
basis
of number
alone
is
unsatisfactory
.
Aristotle, as we saw, qualified
a similar
division by a reference
to
other
considerations
; while
Montesquieu's
division into republics
(democracies
or aristocracies ), monarchies , and despotisms , though

71
logically faulty ,
emphasized
important
features
which
Rousseau
has neglected .
That the legislative
and executive power should
be in different
hands is especially
true
of a democracy
(ie.
a government
in
which all citizens
are born magistrates ).
There never
has
been
and never will be any true democratic
government , for the minority
naturally govern
the majority , and a whole people cannot
remain
in
perpetual
session
to
manage
public
affairs .
A democracy
supposes
a very small
State , simple
habits , and
great equality in
rank and fortune , which secures equality
in rights
and
authority .
The appointment
of deputies would change the
form of adminis-
tration .
In fact, democracy
does tend
constantly
to
change
its
form , and hence
a risk of civil strife and the
need
of continual
vigilance.
A nation of gods might be governed
democratically
,
but not a nation
of men
(III . 4) .
In an aristocracy
the sovereign
and
the government
are
quite
distinct , whereas
in
a democracy
they are liable
to be confused .
There
are three
forms of aristocracy
: natural
aristocracy , which
prevailed in early times and is suitable to simple
peoples ; elective
aristocracy , which grew up when wealth and power
were preferred
to the experience of age ; and hereditary
aristocracy , which sprang
from the
bequest
of
property
and the foundation
of patrician
families .
Elective aristocracy
is the best of all governments , and
hereditary
aristocracy
is the worst .*
The election of magistrates
secures probity, intelligence , and other guarantees
of wise govern-
ment .
In an aristocracy
assemblies
are more
easily
convoked
,
home
affairs
are
conducted
with more
diligence
and
order , and
foreign affairs with more
dignity.
It
is
best
and
most
natural
that the wisest should
govern
the
multitude , if only they
do
so
for the general welfare ; but there is a risk that chiefs
may aim at
independent
authority .
Aristocracy comports
with a certain
in-
equality of fortune , and
it is expedient
that public affairs
should
* In his Letters from the Mountain (VI .) Rousseau asserted that an
aristocracy is the best of governments and the worst of sovereignties .

some truth that

was at bottom

aristocrat .

The Social Contract .
be entrusted
to those who can
devote
their whole time
to
them
(III. 5).
In a monarchy the power is vested in a natural , not in a moral
and
collective
person .
Monarchy
has the vigour
which
unity
gives , but a king , whose
very
training
unfits him to rule, aims at
his own , and not at the public good .
It is an inevitable
defect of
large monarchical
States that
subordinate
officers are
necessary ;
and as a monarchical
government
varies with the
character
of a
king
or of his ministers , it is less
stable than a republican one
(III. 6).
In treating
of monarchies
Rousseau
does not adhere
consistently
to
his
own
definition
;
he
is
really
dealing
with
despotisms of an Oriental
type
in the manner
of Montesquieu ,
and not with royal executive
governments .
He also
deserts
his
definition
in
arguing
that
monarchy
is
capable
of
some
sub-
division ; while in his illustrations
from
Sparta
and
Rome he is
speaking of States in which there was no clear distinction
between
a sovereign
people
and a monarchical
executive .
There is properly
no simple government , for a single chief must
have
subordinate
magistrates , and
a popular government
must
have a head .
The maximum
of strength and
also of weakness
is
found in simple governments , while the mixed forms give a medium
strength
(III . 7).
Rousseau
agreed with Montesquieu
that liberty , not being the
fruit of all climates , is not within the reach
of all nations .
Gov-
ernment
subsists on the surplus
products
of the people's
labour,
and
its
expenditure
varies
with the
needs
and
size of States .
Democracy
is
therefore
best suited
to
small
and
poor
States ,
aristocracy
to those of moderate
wealth
and size, and
monarchy
to
large
States .
Rousseau
held
also
that
despotism
is
most
suitable to warm climates and a good polity to
temperate
regions
(III. 8).
The
suitability
of governments , in
short , depends
on a variety
of conditions
, and none is absolutely
the best.
The
true sign of
a good one is an increasing
population
, which is
evidence
of the
preservation
and prosperity
of the people .
Liberty
conduces
to
prosperity
more than peace does (III. 9 ) .
The government
acts incessantly
against the
sovereign , and , at

length
overcoming
it,
violates
the
social contract .
This is an
inherent vice
which is ever tending
to destroy
the
body politic.
A government
degenerates
:
(a )
when
it
contracts
and
passes
from democracy
through
aristocracy
to royalty — its
natural
ten-
dency ; or (b) when the State is dissolved , which
arises
from the
usurpation of the sovereign
power
by the
government
and
the
consequent
restoration
of natural
liberty , or from the disintegration
of the government
itself owing to the usurpation
of its whole power
by individuals
(III .
10 ) .
Such
is the
natural
and
inevitable
tendency of the best -constituted
governments .
But although
the
government
may be paralysed , the State may live if the legislative
power endures
(III . 11 ) .
Rousseau's
view
that the executive
is
usually in
conflict
with the
general
will , and
must
eventually
overbear
it, is of course grossly
exaggerated .
While
the
sovereign
body is
assembled
the
whole
executive
jurisdiction
is in abeyance
; for where the represented
are there
can be no
representative .
If the
citizens
yield to the ruling
classes , who
always put
obstacles in the way of such assemblies ,
the
doom
of the State is sealed
(III . 14 ) .
But it is absurd
to
contend that the executive
power can
be suspended
; Locke had
rightly
argued
that
it should
be continuous
.
The
sovereign
is
not the same
as the
government
(III .
1) ,
except
in
a
pure
democracy
; and , therefore , to convoke
the sovereign is not to sus-
pend the jurisdiction of the government , which is superior to each
citizen as an individual .
Further , this cessation
of jurisdiction
would
endanger
public order , and " an
assembly of the
people
would," as Voltaire said , " be a solemn invitation to crime ."
Although the people
cannot
be represented
in their legislative
capacity ,
they
can ,
and
should
be ,
in their
executive
power
(III.
15 ).
Government
,
says
Rousseau
in opposition to the
medieval
theory of the
compact , is
established
by
an
act of
sovereignty , not by a contract
of rule
and obedience
between the
people and the king or other chiefs
whom
they appoint. If the
sovereign
people acknowledged
a superior , their supreme authority
would be limited, which is nonsense .
Moreover, in
such a con-
tract there would be no common
authority
to
secure the perform-
ance of reciprocal
engagements .
The

excludes all others , for by this compact
individuals
transferred
all
their rights to the State (III . 16 ).
In establishing
a government
the sovereign
fixes
its form
by law, and
certain
chiefs
are
en-
trusted with it by a particular
act, which is not a law, but a function
of government , since the sovereign
people
by a simple
act of the
general will resolve themselves for this purpose into a democracy .
Such is the subterfuge
by which
Rousseau
tries to
escape
from
the meshes in which his narrow
definition
of law has
entangled
him .
The government
provisionally
established may either retain
power
or invest
others with it, according
to the form which the
sovereign
has decided
to establish
(III . 17 ).
The
depositaries
of the
executive
power
are not
masters
but
officers of the people , appointed
or dismissed by them at will , and
bound to unquestioning
obedience .
Nevertheless , changes in the
established
government
are always
perilous
and
should only
be
made when urgently
needed , though
this
is a question of policy,
not of right .
The formalities
requisite
to distinguish
regular
and
lawful acts
from
their
opposites
should
be
carefully
observed .
Periodical assemblies
are
especially
useful for preventing
usurpa-
tions of the sovereign
power by governments .
Assemblies
should
always
be opened with two
questions , viz . whether the sovereign
desires to maintain
the present
form of government , and
whether
those now charged
with it shall retain office .
In these assemblies
the people practically
re -assume the government , and ifthey please ,
they may dissolve
the
social contract , or
appoint
officers to
con-
duct the government
till the next
assembly .
Should
the govern-
ment usurp the sovereignty
the contract
is broken , and the people
are restored to their natural liberty (III . 18 ).
It had
apparently
been broken
in all existing
States , and therefore
the citizens
were
justified in resuming their natural liberty —if they could .
Rousseau
never attempted
to
explain how his principles
could
be applied in
practice
without
entailing
revolution
or anarchy .
Rousseau
appears
anxious
to
disparage
the
executive
power ,
even speaking of its
exercise as a
burden which men are bound
to
accept
against
their will ;
and
he
is much
more
careful
to
provide
against usurpations
of the government
on the State than
against encroachments
of the State on individual
liberties .

sovereign
can
doubtless
resume
any
power that
it
confers , but ,
although he
admits
that
changes
are
impolitic
except
when
urgently
required ,
Rousseau
would
really
leave
the
executive
little permanence , independence
, or cohesion .
With an executive
whose tenure of office
was precarious , settled government
would
be impossible .
His system , however , is doubtless
only intended
for very
small
States ; in
any
others
it would
be, in
Voltaire's
words, " a code of anarchy ."
In establishing
an executive , the
sovereign
should
be
conceived
as giving
an implicit
pledge
to
maintain it so long as
its
functions
are satisfactorily
performed
.
In the
last book Rousseau
examines
by way
of
comparison
with
"
the best government
that
ever existed
,
viz
.
that
of
Rome
,
the policy most favourable
to
the good constitution
of the State
."*
His imperfect
grasp
of
a
truth he had himself enunciated
,
that the
advantages
of
different
forms
of
government
are
relative
to
cir-
cumstances
,
and
his
ignorance
of
the
details
of
administration
,
prompted
him
to
a
dissertation
on Roman forms
,
apparently
with
a
tacit implication that they can be adapted
to
modern conditions
.
His commendation
of the offices of tribune
,
censor
,
and
dictator
constitutes
a
kind
of
reductio ad absurdum
of
his system from
a
practical standpoint
,
Hobbes had regarded the dictatorship
as
a
remedy for the dissensions
inevitable
in
popular
governments
,
and
the
praise
that
Rousseau
lavished
on this
perilous
institution
would have
excited
the admiration
of
the English
philosopher
.
Rousseau
assigned
to
tribunes
the function
of
watching
over the
preservation
of
the laws
,
and
maintaining
the
respective
rights
of
the sovereign
,
the
government
,
and the citizens
.
In advocat-
ing censors
as
ministers
and
guardians
of
public morality
,
he
was
certainly influenced
not only by the policy
of
the
Romans
,
but
by that of his
great exemplar
Calvin
,
who had rigidly
controlled
public morals
(

In introducing the question
of
civil religion
,
Rousseau

to the intimate
union that
existed

perceive
that this
union

unadapted
to modern
States , in which legislation
provides much
stronger sanctions
than existed in primitive
societies , and in which
the development
of a social conscience
renders
external
induce-
ments to morality
less and less
necessary .
Among modern pro-
gressive
communities
there
is an increasing
tendency
to regard
Church
and State
as properly distinct .
Few persons ,
however ,
would venture
to
dispute
that
ecclesiastical
bodies , whether
es-
tablished
or not , must be subordinated
to the sovereign .
Hobbes
had clearly
realised
that
any
conflict
of jurisdiction
between
the
civil and ecclesiastical
authorities , such as occurred
in the Middle
Ages ,
was
fatal
to
true
sovereignty , and
it
is Hobbes whom
Rousseau
avowedly
follows
when
he
declares
in
favour of the
rigorous
subjection
of the Church .
On the other hand , both have
erred in.recommending
the inculcation
of particular
dogmas under
State authority .
Rousseau
enumerates
three
kinds of religion
: (a) the religion
of the individual
man , internal , personal , or natural
religion , true
theism , without
temples ,
rites , or altars , the
pure
and
simple
religion of the Gospel
; * (6) the religion of the citizen , external and
national , with rites and dogmas prescribed
by law ; (c) the religion
of the priests , which , like Roman Christianity, gives men two sets
of laws , two chiefs , two countries , and subjects
them to contradic-
tory duties .
The
first, or spiritual
religion ,
though
holy and
sublime ,
is
anti -social
and
anti -patriotic ,
since
it
detaches
the
hearts of citizens
from all earthly
things
and renders
men patient
under
despotism .
It was the
divorce
which
Jesus
effected
be-
tween
the
temporal
and
spiritual
powers
that
resulted
in the
suppression of the former by the latter .
In
condemning
Rous-
seau's remarks
on the lack of military courage
and other
quali-
ties
among
Christians
, critics
often ignore
his
definition
of pure
Christianity and
his
statement that
a society
of true
Christians
would no longer
be
a
society
of
men .
The second
kind of
religion may
be useful
in the State itself by identifying
religion
with patriotism
and lawlessness
with impiety , but is injurious if
* Rousseau's own scheme of natural religion is unfolded in his Con-
fession of a Savoyard Vicar (Émile IV.) .

it is superstitious
and
prompts to international
strife .
The third
kind is wholly bad .
What , then , are the true principles governing
the
relations
be-
tween
religion and the State ?
The
sovereign's
rights
over
his
subjects , Rousseau
re-affirms ,
cannot
pass the limits of public
utility , and therefore
the latter
owe no
account
of their opinions
to the former , except so far as such opinions
are of moment
to the
community in their
bearing
on morality or on other mutual
rela-
tions of citizens .
The sovereign
having no competence
in another
world , its
sole aim should
be to secure good
citizenship
.
After
uttering
these laudable
sentiments , Rousseau
propounds
his
civil
profession of faith , the articles of which should
be determined
by
the sovereign , not exactly as dogmas of religion , but as sentiments
of sociability , without
which
a man cannot
be a good citizen
or a
faithful subject .
The sovereign
cannot
compel
a man to
accept
them , but may banish
an unbeliever
from the State , not indeed
as
impious, but as
unsociable
and
incapable
of sincerely loving law
and justice ;
while
a
backslider
may be
slain as the
greatest of
criminals
.
The dogmas
should
be few , simple , and
precise , the
positive
dogmas being the
existence of the Deity, a future
life of
rewards
and
punishments
, the
sanctity of the social pact and of
the laws ;
while
the single
negative
dogma is absence of intoler-
ance (IV. 8).
There is
something
almost
ludicrous
in this solemn
renuncia-
tion of intolerance
after Rousseau's
declaration
that a citizen
may
be put to death for a constructive
act of disbelief
in a set of specu-
lative dogmas .
It matters little whether
a man
be
treated
as a
rebel or an apostate , and whether
the judge
be a civil
magistrate
or an inquisitor ;
the intolerance
is equal in
either
case .
But
Rousseau's
real method
and aim are clear .
Regretting
the loss of
unity which existed of old through
the
alliance
between
religion
and the State , and
insisting
on the supposed
fact
that " no
State
was ever founded
without religion
serving as its basis ," he aimed
at constituting
a civil religion
that should
include as its
funda-
mental principles the
theological
dogmas most
widely
accepted ,
and exclude all those which have
engendered
civil and
national
strife .
The former , being essential to a human
and civic religion ,

Malebut

were rightly to be imposed
as
indispensable
guarantees of social
morality.
Any
other
dogmas
consistent
with these
might be
tolerated .
Thus
once
again we find that
the doctrines
of Rousseau are
fatal to true individual
liberty .
The State would become
a per-
secutor , and every candid
and
ingenuous
citizen would be at the
mercy of any body of religionists
who
might
temporarily
form a
majority
and so be able to impose their opinions on others .
Such
a majority, as claiming to represent the general
will , would
obvi-
ously be entitled to extend indefinitely
the number of compulsory
dogmas ,
and
none
but hypocrites
and
fanatics
would flourish.
Rousseau
had never freed himself
from the
Genevan
puritanism
imbibed in his youth
;
and
his
close
association
of civism , reli-
gion, and morality
was doubtless
another
of his
debts to Calvin .
According to the Ordonnances
of the Church of Geneva , citizens
who refused to participate
in the prescribed
acts of worship
might
be banished
by the ecclesiastical
police
; and Servetus found
that
religious
dissidence
was as criminal as high
treason .
M. Janet
thinks it
possible
that , in an
age when
mere
tolerance , and
not
absolute
religious
liberty , was
recognised , Rousseau's
restriction
of necessary
dogmas to those of natural
religion
may have
had a
liberalising
influence .
But Rousseau
contrasts
unfavourably
with
the tolerant
Montesquieu
, and with Voltaire , the champion of free-
thought
and religious
liberty.
Rousseau's
Such

inflexible and
consistent
treatment
of the
contract
theory ,
said
Green , revealed
the
fundamental
errors
involved
in that
method
of deducing
political
obligation
.
The
hypothesis
of
a state
of
nature and of natural
men , born free and equal in rights , not only
availed
nothing ,
but
hindered
the
search
for a
truer theory.
Hobbes, Locke , and Rousseau
regarded society as static ; they had
no conception
of progress
and
of the
development
of man
and
society
such
as Turgot, Lessing , Condorcet, Hegel , Comte,
and
Spencer
have
made
increasingly
prominent and fruitful .
Nor
again did they anticipate
Hegel's distinction between society
and
the State , though they perceived
that there are collective
interests
that can only be realised
by the formation
of an organized
society .

Further , they erred in
regarding
the
sovereign
as a supreme
and
external coercive
power , created
by the
citizens
and
incessantly
controlling all social affairs , while
at the same time they represent
the citizens
as aiming
at the retention
of
certain
natural
rights ,
and as consenting
parties to the exercise of the sovereign
power ,
even when it acts in direct opposition
to their wishes .
The hope-
less self-contradiction
of such a theory
is manifest .
It is in truth ,
as
Green
said
again , only
as
members of a socfety
recognising
common ends that individuals come to have these rights , and the
sovereign
power is derived
from the
systematisation
and develop-
ment of those
institutions
for the regulation
of a
common
life
without which they would have no rights at all.
No true theory,
in fact , can be based on natural
persons and abstract rights .
The
Greeks had long ago
taught , and Hume
had again pointed
out,
that we must consider the end for which a State exists rather than
the means
by which it is
constituted
.
Rousseau
speaks
of his
political structure
as a machine , and
certainly
he has done little
more than construct
an elaborate
engine of government , which
is
expected
to realise the common
good , when an artificial solidarity
has been produced
by the suppression
of individual liberties
and
private
opinions , and
by the
complete
centralisation
of all the
powers and resources of the community
.
In his
article
on
Political
Economy , Rousseau
compared
the
body politic to an " organised
body, living
and like that of a
man " ; and in the Social
Contract
(II . 7) he speaks of a man
as
receiving
from the
State in
some manner
his life and
his
being ,
while acquiring
powers
which are alien to
him , and of which he
cannot make
use without the
aid of other
people .
But he did
not realise that the State is an organism
in the sense that the co-
operation
of its various
members
is necessary to the existence and
welfare of the body itself, and
that their relation
to the organism
even makes these members
true
individuals .
Primitive
societies
are formless
and incoherent .
A process
of differentiation
is the
beginning of progress , and , combined
with another
process of inte-
gration , effects the
transformation
of indefinite
masses
into duly
organised
groups .
The

of some form of govern-
ment serves to co -ordinate

to
be the best possible
,
nor
to

obeyed
,
unless
enacted
by those
whose
interests

He
affirmed
that the legislative
power

to
the people
,
and that the legislature
should institute

it
may also change

The Reformation marks the beginning
of
a
new and momentous
era-an era destined
to
terminate
three
centuries
later with the
French Revolution
,
which was the legitimate
sequel
of
the
Re
formation
in
the sphere
of
politics
.
The right
of
the individual
to
liberty
of
opinion was the principle underlying
the great religious
upheaval
that once for all freed
men's
minds
from the fetters
of
mediæval
scholasticism
.
The Renaissance
,
organically
connected
with the Reformation
,
contributed
new
stores of learning
,
and
stimulated
thinkers
to
unwonted
vigour and
independence
of
research
.
The study
of
Plato and
of
purer texts
of
Aristotle
was
especially
instrumental
in
broadening
and
deepening
the move-
ment by presenting
novel and lofty ideals
of
life and by suggesting
freer
methods
of
investigation
.
All departments
of
knowledge
were
vitalized
,
and
the
circumscribed
philosophy
,
which for
a
thousand
years had served
as
the handmaid
of
a
crude and narrow
theology
,
rapidly gave place
to
a
new philosophy
of
nature
and
man
,
more liberal
,
more profound
,
and more
comprehensive
.
Relieved from the incubus
of

and un-

Philosophy must begin with

:
the existence

While
a
revolution
was
working
itself out
in
the
world
of
i
thought
,
a
kindred
revolution
was proceeding
in
the
world
of
action
.
As the consciousness
of the individual
longed
for auto-
nomy
,
so
did the nations
long for independence
and self
-
govern-
ment
.
In the Middle Ages feudalism
had linked men
in
a
chain
of personal
dependence
.
King and noble
,
freeman and serf
,
were
connected by mutual
obligations
in
each separate State
,
while
the
ith
Pope
claimed
paramount
authority
over
the
whole
system of
European States
.
But the Reformation
had struck
a
deadly blow
at
the temporal
power
of
the
Papacy
,
feudal
privileges
had
been
curtailed
,
municipal
life
had
been
reawakened
,
and
a
keener
te
popular interest
in
public
affairs
was springing
up
.
Undivided
allegiance
to
the supreme national
authority
gave birth
to
a
truer
patriotism
,
which
was quickened
by the exclusion
of
priests
from
the offices of State
.
At first
,
however
,
liberty of thought was
hardly more
secure
under the Reformers
than under
their theo-
logical antagonists
,
while the removal
of
the controlling discipline
of the
ancient
Church
,
which
,
in
spite
of
its
corruptions
and
superstitions
,
had certain relative
advantages
in
a
comparatively
barbarous
age
,
was followed by disorder
and
strife
.
The urgent
necessity
of settling
national
governments
on
a
legitimate
basis
began
to
be acutely
felt
,
and the
evils
engendered
by the pre-
vailing
unrest
impelled
many
thinkers
to
original
research
on
questions
of
government
.
To this
new
movement
the
study
of
Roman Law and
of
ancient
works
on
politics gave impetus
and
guidance

The Social Contract .
favoured the theory of an original
pact or contract ,* of which
two
forms
may be distinguished
after
the Reformation.
The first , or
biblical
and
medieval
form , which still
survived , was probably
based on the Hebrew idea of a covenant
between
God and
man
(as eg. in
Gen. xvii.
10
or II . Sam . v.
3 ), supplemented
by the
Roman
idea
of
contract .
It
postulated
a
tacit
contract
be
tween the government
and the people .+
The second , or modern
form ,
relates to the institution
of political society
by means
of
a
compact
among
individuals.
It is set forth in Hooker , and , still
more explicitly, in Hobbes, in Locke , and in Rousseau .
The
decline
of the
feudal
nobility having
enabled
kings
to
exercise arbitrary
authority
by freeing themselves from many of the
limitations
which law or custom had imposed upon them , numer-
ous scholars
who had imbibed
a spirit
of liberty
from study of the
republican
institutions
of Greece
and Rome, and who had marked
the fate of evil kings
in the Old
Testament , showed
themselves
eager
to restrain
the
growing
despotism .
Hence
arose
a vast
literature of arguments for and against tyrannicide
.
The defenders
of popular liberties
at first took their stand upon the biblical form
of the compact
theory .
The Vindiciae contra
Tyrannos
( 1579 ),
ascribed
to the
Huguenot
Languet ,
contended
on
scriptural
grounds that kings
derive their
power from the
people's will , and
that if a king violates
the compact
to observe
the laws
which
he
and the people
promise conjointly at the institution
of royalty , the
latter are absolved

Buchanan
also held that king
and people are mutually
bound by a pact , and
that
its violation
by the former entails
forfeiture
of his
rights .
Even the Jesuits
Bellarmine
and Mariana argued that kings
derive
their authority
from the people , while
affirming
that they are subject
to the Pope .
James I. admitted
this theory of a pact in a speech to Parliament
in
1609 , saying
that
" every just king in
a settled kingdom is
* In Roman Law a pact was the product of an
agreement among
individuals , and fell short of a contract, which
was a pact plus an
obligation .

ent aggregates of individuals
in simple juxtaposition
coalesce
and
form
a body whose
connective
tissue
is
composed , not ofill-
defined
custom
and tradition , but of definite law .
By reaction on
its environment , the
organic
growth
attains greater size and
ever-
increasing
diversity and complexity
of structure , while the func-
tions of its members
become
more and more varied .
Again , the
actual form of institutions
must be relative
to circumstances
, and
all
progress
must
depend
on
intelligent adaptation
to
environ-
ment
,
on the suitable
distribution
of
social functions
,
on organised
association
of
citizens
in
mutual
dependence
,
and on
appropriate
modification
of
the social structure
in
response
to
changing
needs
.
The theory
of
a
social organism enables
us
to
escape the dilemma
of
the social contract
theory —the antagonism
between the sovereign
and the citizens
-
since
it
leads us
to
conceive
the
sovereign
less
as
a
coercive
power
than
as
an agent
for furthering
the general
welfare
by securing
free
scope
for the
varied
play
of
individual
interests
.
Moreover
,
this theory
,
in
regarding
society
as
a
per-
sistent
structure
,
with
a
certain
fixity
in
the
distribution
and
relation
of
classes
,
forces
us
to
remember
,
what Rousseau
ignored
,
that
"
the roots
of
the present lie deep
in
the past
,"
and that we
cannot
rudely
cut away existing
institutions
without
impairing
the
efficiency
of
the
organism itself
.
If
the doctrine of heredity
is
problematical
with
reference
to
individual
acquisitions
it
seems
undoubtedly
applicable
to
society
.
Burke
supplies
a
striking
anticipation
of
it
:
"
The idea
of
inheritance
furnishes
a
sure
principle
of
conservation
,
and
a
sure principle
of
transmission
,
without
at
all
excluding
a
principle
of
improvement
.
It
leaves
acquisition
free
;
but
it
secures
what
it
acquires
."
Constitutional
changes
,
therefore
,
must be made
in
subservience
to
fundamental
human
characteristics
,
physical
and
mental
,
as
well
as
to
the
powers and properties
of
nature which form
our environment
.

III.
No attempt can
be made to
trace
with any fulness
the
extra-
ordinary influence
of Rousseau's
ideas and
temperament
on sub-
sequent
literature
and philosophy.
Even those who rose
up to
assail his
doctrines
fell to a large extent
under his potent
spell
;
and the intense
emotional
energy
which
he
diffused
appears
indestructible
,
being
perpetually
re-embodied
in
new
forms .*
What
may
be
called ,
however , the
pure
theory of the
social
contract had little further
vitality , and the
few notable
writers
in
whom it awakened
sympathy
or
antagonism
demand
only a brief
notice.
The triumph of the experiential
and
historical
methods
of
enquiry
and
the
growing
predominance
of the
utilitarian
theory, which emphasized
the end for which a State exists
rather
than the process by which it is instituted , soon made the compact
theory untenable .
In France, Voltaire , who hated speculative
politics , expressed
keen antagonism
to
Rousseau's
ultra -revolutionary
ideas ; for
although he
regarded
a
republican
government
as the
most
tolerable, he was no enthusiast for universal
suffrage and political
equality .
Like Montesquieu
, he
preferred the
gradual
introduc-
tion of constitutional
reforms , reasonably
fearing that a complete
overthrow
of existing
governments
would
be followed
by a violent
reaction .
On the
other
hand ,
Rousseau
found
disciples
in
D'Holbach , whose
Social
System
( 1773 )
set
out with the hypo-
thesis of a tacit pact ; in Condorcet, who became an interpreter
of
Rousseau
in the revolutionary
struggle , and whose
Progress of the
66
social contract and social organism theories by combining
them in his
theory of a
contractual organism ."
It is , he says , not contiguity , but
voluntary
union , a moral bond of conventions and promises , that uni-
fies the members of a society, and the more contractual
an organism
is, the more truly organised
is it.
The term , " contractual organism ,"
although awkward in so far as it suggests
that the members of an or-
ganism are individually
free to co-operate or not with
one another ,
nevertheless expresses
concisely the conception of society as a body of
interdependent
members
whose relations
are
determined
partly by
birth and environment and partly by voluntary contract .

essays
(VII . to IX .) in Method
and Results has attacked the new Rousseauism .

The Social Contract .
Human Mind owed
much to his influence
;
in
Raynal ,
whose
socialistic
doctrines
savoured
more of the
Discourse on Inequality
than of the Social
Contract .
In Germany
two great
names , those
of Kant and
Fichte , are
linked
with Rousseau's
theory .
Kant, * who
proceeded analyti
cally, and not synthetically
like
Rousseau , conceived
the
simple
idea of the act
by which
a
nation
constitutes
itself a State
as a
contract
by which men
resign
their external
liberty in order
to
resume it immediately
as members
of a State in a legal depend-
ence
resulting
from their own
will .
He
recognised
clearly
that
the compact is only an " idea of reason ," a convenient
method for
representing
the process
by which the
State
is
organised
and
mutual
rights established
; yet he
regarded it as having practical
reality in that it obliges the legislator
to dictate
his laws as if they
represented
the general will of the nation , while it binds all citizens
to observe the laws as if they had freely consented
to them .
Thus
Kant regarded
the social
pact as a kind of fiction expressing
the
characteristics
of political
obligation
applicable
to
any
State ,
whatever
its
historical
origin
.
He
also held that
it
is
man's duty
to
pass into the civil
state
as
the only mode
of guaranteeing
justice
.
Further
,
he
considered
that
a
republican
constitution
is
the legitimate
outcome
of
the idea
of
an
original
contract
as
the
source of all rightful legislation
,
though
he regarded
a
democracy
,
in
which the whole
people
have
both
legislative
and executive
power
,
as
necessarily
despotic
.
According
to
Fichte
,†
also
,
the
social
compact
furnishes
the fundamental
idea
by
the
rule of
which societies
should
act
,
and
it
implies the right
of
the people
to change their institutions
.
Political
institutions
include
:
(a)
a
free
contract
among
political
units
as
a
mutual
guarantee
of
rights
;
(b)
a
legislature
through
which the
common
will
of
the
people becomes law
;
and
(c)
an
executive
which
realises this will
and
so
unites the private and the general will
.
The actual
State
must be made
to
approximate
more and more
to
the rational
State
.
Rousseau
had few disciples
in
England

al
were chief among those who
adopted
his principles.
Paine and
Godwin
supported
doctrines
still more extreme and revolutionary
.*
Godwin
definitely
repudiated
the
social
contract .
He
desired
to abolish all governments , to
reduce all
ordered
society to its
original elements , and
thus to
restore the
state
of nature .
He
was, in short, a philosophical
anarchist .
Burke, however , best
represents
the prevailing
attitude
towards
Rousseau
in England .
The positive
English spirit , with
its ingrained
distaste for meta-
physical
reasoning
and
abstract
theorising ,
was
expressed
in
Burke's contemptuous
allusion to " the chaff and rags and
paltry
blurred shreds of paper about the rights of man .”
d.
I
Rousseau , the man of natural
rights , was the very antitype
of
Burke , the man of constitutional
law.
Art is man's nature , was
Burke's principle, and
the
destructive
tendencies
of the French
philosophers
angered
him .
Reverencing
national
constitutions
as
almost sacred structures , built up by a laborious , age-long process ,
and directed
to lofty and permanent
ends , he was indignant with
"those whose principle it is to despise the ancient
and permanent
sense of mankind , and
to set
up
a scheme
of society on
new
principles."
" Rage and phrenzy will pull down
more in half an
hour than prudence , deliberation
, and foresight
can build up in a
hundred years ” ; while
by preserving
the method of nature
in
the conduct
of the State , in what we improve
we are never wholly
new ; in
what
we
retain
we
are
never
wholly
obsolete ."
He
despised the notion of a geometrical
and arithmetical
constitution
.
Burke, however , did not cast aside the social compact doctrine-
he regarded
the constitution
as
the " engagement
and
pact of
society ."
"If civil
society
be the offspring
of convention
, that
convention
must
be
its law.
That
convention
must limit and
modify all the descriptions
of constitution
which are formed under
it.
Every sort of legislative , judicial , or
executory
power are its
creatures ."
In entering civil society
a man abdicates
all right
to
be judge in his own cause and surrenders
his
right of self-defence
as well as some of his liberty ; to talk of abstract rights
is useless .
Further, if society
is
a contract , it
is no casual
and
temporary

Leslie
Stephen's

Thought

The Social Contract.
partnership , but a permanent , organic union.
The constitution of
a State and the due distribution of
its
powers are
matters
of
the
most delicate
and complicated
skill
.
"It
requires
a
deep
know-
ledge
of
human
nature and human necessities
,
and
of
the things
which
facilitate
or
obstruct
the
various
ends
which are to be
pursued by the mechanism
of
civil institutions
."
The science
of
constructing
or
reforming
a
State cannot
be
taught
a
priori
;
it
requires
patience
and far more than the experience
of
a
life
-
time
.
"
The nature
of
man
is
intricate
;
the objects
of
society
are of
the greatest possible
complexity
."
Hence the boasted
simplicity
of new political
constitutions
shows that they
are fundamentally
defective
,
and
that
their artificers
are grossly
ignorant
or
narrow
in their views
.
While
Rousseau
had insisted
on the
evils of
particular
associations
,
Burke insisted
on the
value
of
"
all that
combination
and all that opposition
of interests
which
,
in
the natural
and
in
the political world
,
from
the reciprocal
struggle
of discordant
powers
,
draws
out the
harmony
of the
universe
.
These opposed
and
conflicting
interests
in-
terpose
a
salutary check
to
all precipitate
resolutions
;
they render
deliberation
a
matter not
of
choice
,
but
of
necessity
;
they make
all change
a
subject
of
compromise
,
which naturally
begets modera-
tion
."*
Thus Burke endeavoured
to
explain
or
extenuate those
inequalities
and
inconsistencies
in
political
institutions
which
Rousseau's
mechanical
and
symmetrical
theory
ignored
or
con-
temned
.
•
•
The value
attached
to
Rousseau's
work was
evidenced
by the
requests
made
to
him
to
draw up
constitutions
for Corsica and
Poland
.
In the Social Contract
he observed
that
there was still
in
Europe one country
capable
of
legislation
,
viz
.
Corsica
,
which
,
under Paoli's leadership
,
had long waged
a
glorious
but
hopeless
struggle
against the Genoese
.
In
1764
Buttafuoco
,
a
Corsican
officer
,
applied
to
Rousseau
to
frame
a
code
of
laws
and
a
set
of
political
institutions
,
but there
is
some
doubt
whether
he
acted

"

with the concurrence
of his fellow -countrymen
.
Rousseau
, after
accepting the invitation and issuing
the
Project of a Constitution
for
Corsica ,
was
prevented
by
personal
pre -occupations
from
pursuing his designs .
In 1768
Corsica was ceded to France.
In 1772, in response to a request
of the Poles, Rousseau
pro-
duced his
Considerations
on the
Government
of Poland, which
contains many modifications
of his political theories , and serves
as a kind of corrective
to the abstractions
of the
Social Contract .
He recommended
truly national
institutions
, a re-establishment
of ancient
customs ,* the civic education
of youth , and the intro-
duction of a representative
system .
But the partition
of Poland ,
which
Rousseau
feared , occurred
in the following
year .
Thus
both attempts
to apply his
principles
to
practical
affairs
proved
abortive.
IV.
In conclusion
, reference
must be made to Rousseau's
influence
on the course of historical events .
Whether his
doctrines
con-
tributed in any degree to the cause of American
independence
it
is extremely difficult to determine .
The Puritans of New England
had from the beginning
been
thoroughly
democratic , at least in
principle ; † and Locke's theories
of popular sovereignty
and of
the lawfulness
of rebellion
were probably
well known in America .
But it is likely that the close intercourse
between the French and
the
revolutionary
leaders
familiarised
the
latter
with
many
of
Rousseau's
principles
.
The Declaration
of Independence
( 1776)
was a declaration
of natural , abstract , and inalienable
rights wholly
in his spirit . " We hold these
truths to be self-evident —that
all
men
are created
equal
;
that
they are
endowed
by the Creator
with inalienable
rights
;
that
among
these
are life
,
liberty
,
and
the pursuit
of
happiness
."
It
is
also
affirmed
that governments
have been instituted
to
assure these
rights
,
that
they derive
their
just power from the consent
of
the governed
,
and that the people
have
a
right
to
change
or
destroy
a
government
destructive
of
these ends
.

The Social Contract .
similar
principles are asserted .
Thus , in the Virginian
Declara-
tion of Rights, we are told that all men are by nature equally
free
and independent
, that they possess
certain
inherent
rights , and
that all powers reside in the people .
If the Americans
learned
anything
from their French allies, the
debt was amply repaid by the direct
impulse
which their rebellion
communicated
to
the
revolutionary
movement
then stirring in
France .
Keen observers had long foreseen that a volcanic
outburst
was impending in that distressful
country .
D'Argenson had pre-
dicted
it as
early as
1752
; while
Lord
Chesterfield
, writing
on
December
25th , 1753 , said
that " all the symptoms which I ever
inet with in history
previous
to great
changes
and revolutions in
government
now exist and daily increase in France."
Rousseau *
himself had
written
in
1762 , " We
are
approaching
a state
of
crisis and an
age of revolutions
;" while , later on , in his
Confes-
sions, he dwelt on disasters in war, bad administration
, and general
discontent
as portents of a coming
dissolution
.
He was, indeed,
a prophet who hastened the fulfilment of his own prophecies
; for
his work made him the spiritual
father of the Revolution . " The
Contrat Social ranks
with the Wealth of Nations
as one of the
two political works of the eighteenth
century which have had the
greatest influence
upon
public affairs ." +
The
influence
of Vol-
taire
and
Montesquieu
, the
constitutionalists
,
and of Morelly ,
Mably , and Raynal, the socialists , counted for little in comparison
with
that
of Rousseau . " Take
away Jean
Jacques
from
the
eighteenth
century , leave
only Montesquieu and
Voltaire , and
you can no longer
explain
the insurrection
of minds , their ardour
to gain freedom , their enthusiasm , their faith , the spirit, the virtues,
the power , and the greatness of our Revolution."
In the salons
and in the streets his doctrines
were eagerly discussed .
In
1765
Hume wrote from Paris : " It is impossible
to express or imagine
the enthusiasm of this nation in his favour ;
no person
ever so much
engaged their attention
as Rousseau .

everybody
else
are
quite
eclipsed
by him."
He
had ,
indeed ,
proclaimed
as with a trumpet -blast
the
enfranchisement
of the
people , and the sound vibrated
throughout
France, arousing the
oppressed
from
the dull
sleep of servitude .
Those who had so
long bowed under
the yoke of priest and noble now began to walk
erect with all the pride
and confidence
of free-born men .
Quinet
said rightly that Rousseau
bequeathed
to the Revolution not only
his ideas
but
his
temperament
; he was its soul and gave it his
own religious
and emotional
character
; and thus he became " the
forerunner
of the
emancipated
people ."
The
testimony
of con-
temporaries
proves
that
his
influence
penetrated
every phase of
the great
struggle .
Napoleon
said that without
Rousseau
there
Iwould have
been
no
Revolution .
Saint -Just
entitled
him the
"revolutionary
man ."
Mercier
described
his work as "the lever
for overturning
the
colossus
of
despotism ."
Joseph
Chénier
affirmed
that
the
human
race
had
lost its
title -deeds
and that
Rousseau
had found
them .
At a later time Lamartine spoke of
him as the " great and fatal utopist of societies ," and of the Social
Contract as (6the fundamental
book of the Revolution ."
The
Social
Contract
was
not ,
as
detractors
suggest ,
a mere
phrase -book of fanatics .
Taine has called it " adulterated
brandy ; "
but in the revolutionary
epoch it was regarded
as " the beacon of
legislators ," and was incessantly
quoted
as such
by lawyers
and
publicists.
" It is in all hands ," said Camille Desmoulins
.
Taine
himself tells us that in
1784
certain
magistrates ' sons , on taking
their first
lesson in jurisprudence
, had the Social Contract
placed
in their hands as a manual .
It was, in fact , a political
catechism
for all classes , and its chief propositions
were widely disseminated
.
Coleridge
says that
he
knew men
of
intelligence
who
were
travelling in France at the commencement
of the Revolution , and
who bore witness
that " the public highways
were
crowded
with
enthusiasts , some
shouting
the watchwords
of the
Revolution ,
others
disputing
on the
most
abstract
principles
of the
universal
constitution
,
the most
ignorant
confident
of his fitness
for the highest
duties of a legislator , and all prepared
to shed their

blood in defence of the inalienable
sovereignty of the self-governed
people .
The
more
abstract
the
notions
were , with the
closer
affinity did they combine
with the most fervent feelings and all the
immediate
impulses
to action ."
We find
Rousseau's
principles
embodied
in the petition of the Tiers État of Nivernois ,* in which
the people
complain of “ the profound
ignorance
of the conditions
of the social
pact which has
perpetuated
their
servitude ," and
demand the restitution
of the inalienable
and imprescriptible
rights
of the people .
In the hymn of the twentieth
Vendémiaire the
people
proclaimed
him a true
citizen , a friend
of nature
and of
truth , and hailed him as the model
of sages
and the benefactor
of humanity .
The very thought of him aroused
enthusiasm . "O
Jean Jacques," cried
a volunteer , " that thou art not a witness
of
our Revolution !
Thou
wert the
precursor
of it,
thy
writings
have enlightened
us."
Mallet du Pan † wrote that Rous-
seau "had
a hundred
times
more
readers
than Voltaire among
the middle and lower classes of society .
It is he alone
who has inoculated
the French
with the
doctrine
of the sove-
reignty
of the
people
and
its most
extreme
consequences . I
heard
Marat , in
1788, reading
and
commenting
on the Social
Contract
in the
public
promenades
amid
the
plaudits
of an
enthusiastic
audience .
It would be difficult
to mention
a single
revolutionary
who
was
not
transported
with
these
anarchical
theories
and
burning
with the desire
to
realise
them .
This
Social
Contract , the
solvent
of
society , was the
Koran
of the
bombastic
talkers
of
1789 ,
of the
Jacobins
of
1790, of the
Republicans
of
1791 , and
of the
most
atrocious
of the
mad-
men ." A thousand
pamphleteers
paraphrased
it ; the
orators
of the Palais Royal
discoursed
from it on popular
sovereignty
,
loudly demanding
the abolition of privileges
and
the
establish-
ment of a free , democratic
constitution ; the club orators
made
it their breviary .

Rousseau

nouncing

and
attacking
property ,
had
ascribed
the
gross civil and political inequalities
that existed to the evil opera-
tions of government .
They were at once
socialistic
in spirit and
anarchical
in tendency .
Rousseau's
hostility to knowledge
and
culture had led him to exalt
the
uneducated
masses , and to trust
to the free play of their
natural
instincts
for the regeneration
of society .
The
very
vagueness
of his
general
principles
com-
mended
them to the multitude , and their plausibility made them
dangerous
in the
mouths
of
demagogues .
The people
are
sovereign
by " natural
right ,” and the sovereign
is everything
that
it should
be ; the people are the sole source of legitimate
power ,
and are supreme
over all individuals and all property .
The name
citizen " acquired
a new significance , for
it now implied partici-
pation in the sovereign
power .
The pauperized
peasant and
the
social outcast were at length to rank , civilly and politically , on an
equality
with
their
old oppressors .
Vox populi, vox dei was no
longer an empty phrase , but an indubitable truth .
"C
He

of the Revolution cannot
fairly be attributed to
Rousseau's
teachings , for he

had warned
the
Poles
that reform
needed great
circumspection
;
he had contended
that
legislation
should
be
adapted
to the cha-
racter
of the
people
as well
as to climate
and
other conditions ;
and he had
affirmed
not only that a true
democracy
is impos-
sible, but that an elective
aristocracy
is the best form of govern-
ment .
His own system was formulated
for a group of small and
homogeneous
States , and
he refused
in anticipation
to
be held
responsible
for any of the abuses of large States .
The
attempted
application of his limited
conceptions
to a large and
diversified
State
naturally
produced
startling
results ;
while
the
demoralisa-
tion caused by the overthrow
of the old feudal system , the rotten
state of the
finances ,
and the lack of administrative
skill
and
knowledge
among
the
leaders
who
were striving vainly to con-
struct
a new
engine
of government
on
ideal
principles
in utter
disregard
of what
was
practicable , rendered
violence
almost
in-
evitable .
Some have been
disposed
to assign to Montesquieu's
influence
the work of the moderate
revolutionists
who
predominated
in the


90
The Social Contract .
T
Constituent
Assembly , and
to credit
Rousseau
with
the work of
the Convention and
other
excesses.
But Burke
described
the
latter as
the
insane
Socrates
of the
National
Assembly," and
there was more of Rousseau
than of Montesquieu
in the speeches
of
its
members
,
"
twelve
hundred
Jean Jacques
Evangelists
,"
as
Carlyle called
them
.
Rousseau's
was
the
first
of the
statues
erected
by the
Assembly
.
Eymar
,
one
of
the deputies
,
spoke
of the Social
Contract
as
"
the
charter
in
which you
found the
National
Rights
;
there
you
learned
where
alone
the
impre-
scriptible
,
unalterable
right
of
sovereignty
is
placed
."
Another
member
,
the Protestant
leader
Rabaut
de
St. Étienne
,
summed
up Rousseau's
radical
doctrines
by denouncing
all French institu-
tions
,
and by contending
that
it
is
necessary
to
destroy everything
,
in
order
that
men
and
things
,
manners
and
laws
,
ideas
and
language having been changed
,
all may be created
anew
.
A
root
and branch
revolution
of
this kind was advocated
by the
"
thirty
voices
,"
a
faction
sitting
on the extreme
left
,
which included the
fateful
Robespierre
,
and which was destined
to
increase
with the
decrease
of
all other existing
parties
.
Mirabeau and
Siéyès
,
two
of
the greatest
names
in
the Assembly
,
were
warm
admirers
of
Rousseau
.
In 1788 Siéyès had issued
a
famous brochure
,
"
What
is
the Tiers État
?"
which contains
the quintessence
of
the Social
Contract
.
"
What
is
the Tiers État
?
Everything
.
What
has
it
been hitherto
?
Nothing
.
What does
it
ask for
?
To be some-
thing
."
The Third
Estate
,
he asserted
,
is
fettered and oppressed
,
though without the nobility
it
might be free
and
flourishing
.
It
is
at
length
necessary
to
constitute
the
nation
as
a
single
whole
.
But Siéyès and most
of
Rousseau's
disciples
so
far deserted
his
precepts
as
to
approve
of
large States and
a
representative
system
,
deeming
that federalism
was
inconsistent
with the unity and in-
divisibility of
a
republic
.
At the very outset
there
had
been
a
struggle
on the
question
of
voting par ordre
or
par
tête
in
the
States
-
General
,
and the
representatives
of
the people
vindicated
the principle
of
equality
against
nobles
and
clergy
.
A
month
later
they boldly declared
themselves
the
sovereign
National Assembly and
proceeded
to
formulate
a
constitution
.
On the night of August 4th
,
1789
,

orders and privileges
and
many feudal
abuses were
abolished
in
accordance
with
Rousseau's
doctrine
that
liberty could
not
subsist without equality .
The
famous
Declaration
of the Rights
ofMan, which affirmed
the principles
on which the new govern-
ment was to be based , is full of his theories . It declares
:
( 1) that
men are born free and
equal in rights ;
( 2) that
these
rights
are
liberty , property ,
security ,
and
resistance
to
oppression .
Other
clauses affirm that the nation is
sovereign , and
that
no body of
individual
can
exercise
any
authority
which does
not
emanate
from it ; that the law is the expression
of the general
will ;
and
that all
citizens
have a right to participate
in
legislation , either
personally
or by their representatives .
When , however , it was
proposed
to enumerate civic duties , the Assembly was as reticent
as Rousseau .
The organisation
of Paris into sections
(not unlike
the ancient
democratic
States ) , in which the inhabitants
exercised
almost
sovereign
power ,
and
passed
resolutions
that
had
the
force of law, reminds
one of Rousseau's
ideal community .
Further,
the
numerous
overlapping
governing
powers
throughout the
country were abolished
and were
superseded
by a
simpler , more
regular
system .
France, as a whole , was divided into communes ,
which Burke described
as separate
republics
; but representation
in a national
legislature
was of course
admitted .
Federations
of
towns and districts
were
formed
to secure observance
of the law ,
and a grand
federation
of the whole
nation
was held in Paris in
1790 , as a manifestation
of unity
and fraternity .
National guards
were organised
to replace those mercenaries
whom
Rousseau
had
denounced .
In 1790 the Church
was subordinated
to the State
by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy
; and
in the
same
year
Louis XVI . swore to use all the power
delegated
to
him by the
State in support
of the new constitution
.
In 1791 the Assembly
dissolved
itself.
In two years it had
swept
away
feudalism , had
acknowledged
individual
liberty
and
equality in civic
rights , and
had established
Rousseau's
leading
principles
that
the people
are
sovereign , that all executive
functions
should
be
delegated , and
that the executive
and
the Church
should
be
controlled
by a
popular legislature .
In practice
the
legislative
tended
more and
more to usurp
the functions
of the
executive
power , which
was

exercised by committees
of the popular assembly .
This
subordi-
nation
was also a reflex of Rousseau's
theory .
The Constituent
Assembly
had not instituted
absolute
equality
in the
suffrage ; but under
the
ardent
and youthful Legislative
Assembly the real power passed into other hands . The Girondins ,
who at
first
preponderated
in the new
legislature , found bitter
opponents
in the Jacobins , who
constituted
the
violent
section
and broad-based
their power
upon
clubs
scattered
throughout
France .
Both
parties ,
however ,
borrowed
doctrines
from
Rousseau .
Among the
Girondins
the
philosopher
Condorcet
was a notable
disciple
; while , on
account
of his
influence
upon
their opponents , Rousseau
was called "the grand Pontiff
of the
Jacobins ."
In
its
declaration
of
war the
Legislative
Assembly
proclaimed
the inherent
and
irrevocable
sovereignty
of
peoples
,
together
with
their
inalienable
right
of making
and
changing
laws
,
and
of
deposing
all usurpers
of
the
supreme
power
.
The
dethronement
of
the king
on August
10th
,
1792
,
signalised
the
beginning
of
the arbitrary and dictatorial
epoch
of
the Revolution
.
An attempt
was made
to
defend
even the
September
massacres
by
a
perversion
of
Rousseau's
teachings
:
"
When
a
society
or
the
majority wish
a
thing
it
is
just
;
the
minority
is
always
guilty
even
if
morally right
.”"
France
became
a
republic
upon
the
establishment
of the
National
Convention
,
which
showed
its determination
to
act in
pursuance
of
Rousseau's
early
maxim
that
the
destruction
of
existing
institutions
is
essential
to
happiness
.
It
reformed
educa-
tion on
Rousseau's
principles
and
began
a
new legal
code
.
It
declared
that
the
monarchy
could not be legitimate
since
it
did
not exist
in
accordance
with
the
general
will
,
and
its laws
were
therefore
not true
laws
;
moreover
,
the
monarch
being
only
a
usurper ofthe legislative
power
,
his hereditary
office
was incom-
patible
with liberty
.
Again
,
since
the
royal
government
was
not
appointed
by the
sovereign
people
and
obedience
was
imposed
by force
,
the
social
contract
was
broken
,
and
citizens
were justified
in
resuming their natural
rights
.
When Louis was
brought
to
trial
,
the Jacobin
Saint
-
Just demanded
that
he should
be
treated
as
a
public
enemy
,
for
Rousseau
had
said
that

criminal
is
a foe of the State and
can therefore
be
slain
as a
violator of the pact .
" Let us tell the king," said the Girondin
Isnard , " that the nation
is his sovereign , and
that
he is subject
to the law ."
The
dreaded
name
of Marat
is
associated
with
the
violent
measures that ensued upon the fall of the Girondins in June , 1793 .
He
had long
been
notorious
for his
extreme
views .
To the
starving
Parisians
he had proclaimed
that
society is based
on a
contract
terminable
at will, that the rich having
violated
it, the
state of nature was restored , and that all were now free to
take
what they could.
To realize revolutionary
ideals
more
speedily ,
the
people's
idol
proposed
that
a
dictator
should
be
created .
Châlier , an imitator
of Marat, while
addressing
the Club at Lyons
cried : " You
are kings and
more than kings
; do
you
not feel
the sovereignty
circulating
in your veins ? "
The constitutional
law of 1793
marks the growth of a still more
democratic
spirit.
The
problem
to be
solved , said
Hérault
de
Séchelles , is to guarantee at once the exercise of the general
will
and unity of representation
.
Unlimited
sovereignty , magistracies
held on precarious
tenure , direct
elections
in which
all should
take
part , primary
assemblies which should meet at
fixed
dates
without summons , and
which
should
nominate
representatives
and control their
acts,
a
national
assembly
drawn
from
the
primary
assemblies and annually
renewed , —such
were the proposi-
tions by which
Rousseau's
principles
were to be
realised .
But
the new constitution
was soon found
unworkable
.
The Committee
of
Public
Safety , which now controlled all
executive
powers , was established
by the Montagnards
, or extreme
Jacobins , who
included
Robespierre
, Couthon , and Saint-Just .
These men , professed followers of Rousseau , carried
his doctrines
to the most
violent
extremes .
In the name of the public safety
they excused
murder
and
outrage ,
and
initiated
the Reign of
Terror .
Rousseau , who
had
proclaimed
that to
sacrifice
an
innocent man for the
safety of the
multitude
is one of the most
execrable
maxims of tyranny , and the
most
dangerous
that
can
be admitted , would
have
abhorred
the
atrocities
of these
false
disciples .
"What
constitutes
the republic," said
Saint -Just , "is

94
The Social Contract.
the destruction
of everything
that is opposed to it ; " " liberty must
conquer at any cost ."
To
Robespierre
"the government
of the
Revolution
was the
despotism
of liberty against
tyranny," and
he affirmed
that the motive
powers of popular
government
should
be virtue and terror-terror which is " nothing but prompt, severe ,
and inflexible justice."
They
desired
to
give
all the
citizens
similar
interests by levelling
all
class
distinctions
; and , sharing
Rousseau's
belief in the
pliancy
of
human
nature , they
were
eager to change
the
customs
and
character
of the
French
and
mould them upon the
simple
and
virtuous
types
of antiquity .
" You must
entirely
refashion
a
people
that you
desire to
make
free-destroy its prejudices , change its habits , limit its necessities ,
eradicate
its
vices ,
purify
its desires ."
Such
was the method
recommended
by the decree of the Committee
of April 20th , 1794 ,
reported
by Billaud -Varenne .
Saint -Just
formed
his
ideas
on
the polity of Sparta ;
and
the
ancient
republics
became
the
objects of exaggerated
eulogy .
Robespierre
declared , almost
in
Rousseau's
words , that " the sovereignty
resides
in the people ;
it
is
one , indivisible ,
imprescriptible
,
and
inalienable
."
The
government , too, was to
be indivisible ,
that
is,
the
old,
bad
system
of
centralisation
was
to
be
maintained
.
The
citizens
were to be free , equal , and
fraternal
; while
the public
safety and
welfare were to be the end , and
virtue the principle, of political
action .
These ideas
were
deemed
just and
natural , but those
who supported
them had
no
clear
notions
how they
could be
realised
without
resort
to
force .
Robespierre
,
Couthon ,
and
Saint-Just working in
alliance
on
Rousseau's
principles, aspired
to be model
legislators .
But, like the
Decemvirs , they
crushed
out liberty in liberty's
name , and practically
annihilated
the rights
of the citizen .
Saint -Just
even desired to
nominate
Robespierre
as dictator
in order
that their projects
of regeneration
might be
more speedily
and
completely
carried
into
effect .
Their
master
had commended
the dictator's
office .
In 1794
Robespierre
, who
held
with
Rousseau
that
society
should
repose
on
a religious
basis , caused the
Convention
to decree
that
the
French
nation
should acknowledge
the existence of God and
the immortality of
the soul.
Festivals
were decreed
in honour of the supreme being

and of the moral
and
republican
virtues , and
civil
religion
was
imposed
upon France.
In such
manifold
ways
and
by
such
diverse
men were
the
principles
of
Rousseau
applied
to
practice . "Royalists
and
aristocrats
were pursued
in the name of liberty
and equality ; the
Girondins , in the
name
of indivisibility ;
Philippeaux , Camille
Desmoulins
, and the moderates , in the name of the public safety ;
Chaumette
,
Anacharsis
Clootz ,
Gobet,
Hébert ,
and
all
the
anarchist
and atheist party in the name of virtue and the supreme
being."*
Mr.
Lecky
has
said
with
truth
: † " That
which
distinguishes
the French Revolution from other
political
move-
ments
is that
it was directed
by men
who
had
adopted
certain
speculative
a priori
conceptions
of
political
right
with
the
fanaticism
and proselytising
fervour of a religious
belief, and
the
Bible of their creed was the
Contrat
Social of Rousseau ."
In
1794
a public
funeral
was
decreed to
Rousseau , and
his
remains
were borne
in state to the
Panthéon
, the Social
Contract
being carried
in front of the Convention.
Robespierre
apostro-
phised
him
as the apostle of liberty and
equality , and
ascribed
to
him
the happy
changes
that
had been
wrought
in
manners ,
customs , and laws , and in the minds of men .
Thus the vagueness and
latitude
of Rousseau's
principles
had
enabled the worst tyrants
to employ
them for the worst
purposes .
The power of the
Convention, which rested
on a broad
demo-
cratic
foundation
, became
centred
in men whose
tyranny
was as
ruthless
as that of the deposed
line of kings .
What wonder
that
exhausted
France, misled
by
metaphysics , betrayed
by false
or
visionary leaders , and
deluged
with
the blood
of citizens , was
fain to
seek refuge at the feet of the
mighty
despot
Napoleon ,
who alone could evolve order out of chaos ?
It is impossible
to trace the
subsequent
labyrinthine
ramifica-
tions of Rousseauism
.
His influence
is
revealed
in the Swiss
Referendum
for submitting
legislative
proposals
to the direct vote
of the whole nation , as well as in the Napoleonic plebiscite , which
furnished
a lamentable
illustration of the people's
liability to be

The Social Contract.
deceived .
The
unguarded
application
of Rousseau's
principles
in
France
has, indeed , been
largely
responsible
for that revolu-
tionary method
in politics
which has caused
so many changes
of
constitutions
and
ministries
during
the past
century .
Outside
France there
has
been
too general
a tendency
to
apply
prema-
turely the doctrine
of popular
sovereignty , without due considera-
tion of race , social
conditions
, education , past
history , and
other
circumstances .
It
has
been
overlooked
that
many
things
are
right which are not expedient .
In South
America, the adoption
of democratic
government
has been merely
the establishment
of
an unstable
monarchy
under
republican
forms . In England , how-
ever , the principle promises to be fully, and yet safely, realised by the
institution of manhood
suffrage , by the shortening of the duration
of Parliaments
, and by the abolition of the hereditary
element
in
the legislature
; but the growing
tendency to regard representatives
as mere delegates bound
by imperative
mandates
is liable
to deter
men of wisdom
and
character
from
entering the political
arena ,
and to encourage
the growth of mere self-seeking opportunism
.
In overthrowing
the old
conception
that
property
and birth
should alone
give a title to political power , and in
strenuously
upholding the claim of the toilers
to share in the government
of
the State which they sustain by their
productive
labour , Rousseau
did inestimable
service to the cause of liberty .
But his insistence
on the alienation
of all persons
and
property
to the State is
a
perilous
doctrine , which has doubtless
given
an
impulse , if not
a foundation
, to the socialistic
movement
of the present century .
Fourier , Saint -Simon , Owen , Lassalle , and Marx have
carried the
problem of popular
control into the industrial
sphere , where it
now presses for solution
more powerfully
than in the domain of
politics .
The labour movement
is the
most
significant
outcome
of democracy .
The growth
of socialistic
and anarchic
doctrines
in this
generation
is, however , a symptom
of social
disease , and
forces
us to
consider
whether
the
existing
predominance
of
aristocratic
and plutocratic influences , with the glaring inequalities
which they
entail , does not
constitute
a grave
menace to the
peace and welfare of the State .

THIS little

extracted
from
a larger work undertaken
at
an
earlier

long since abandoned .
Of the various

that might be
selected
from what was

, the following is the

appears to
me the

INTRODUCTORY
NOTE
I WISH to
enquire
whether , taking
men as they are and
laws
as
they can be made , it is possible
to establish
some just and certain
rule
of administration
in
civil
affairs .
In this
investigation I
shall always
strive
to
reconcile
what
right
permits
with
what
interest
prescribes , so that justice
and utility may not be severed .
I enter upon this enquiry without demonstrating
the importance
of my subject . I shall
be
asked
whether I am
a prince
or a
legislator
that I write
on
politics . I reply that I am
not ; and
that it is for this very reason that I write
on politics . If I were
a
prince
or a legislator , I should
not waste
my time in saying
what ought to be done ; I should
do it or remain
silent .
Having been
born a citizen of a free State ,¹ and a member
of
the sovereign
body , however
feeble
an
influence
my voice
may
have in public affairs , the right
to vote
upon them
is sufficient to
impose
on me the
duty
of informing
myself
about
them ; and
I
feel
happy , whenever I
meditate
on governments , always to
discover
in my researches
new reasons
for loving that of my own
country.

CHAPTER
I.
SUBJECT
OF THE FIRST BOOK.
MAN is born free , and everywhere
he is in chains .
Many a one
believes himself the master of others , and yet he is a greater
slave
than they.
How has this
change
come about ? I do not know.
What
can render it legitimate ? I believe
that I can settle
this
question .
If I considered
only force and the results that proceed from it,
s
I should say that so long as a people
is
compelled
to obey and
does
obey , it does well ; but that , so soon
as it can shake off the
yoke
and does
shake
it off, it does
better ; for, if men
recover
their freedom
by virtue
of the same right
by which
it was taken
away,
either
they
are
justified
in
resuming
it, or there
was no
justification
for depriving
them ofit.
But the
social
order is a
sacred
right which serves as a foundation
for all others .
This
right
however , does not come from
nature .
It is therefore
based
on conventions
.
The question is to know what these conventions

to that , I must
establish what I have just
laid down .

With regard to the
right of conquest , it
has no
other founda-
tion than the law of the strongest .
If war does not confer on the
victor the right of slaying
the vanquished , this
right , which
he
does not possess, cannot
be the foundation
of
a right to enslave
them .
If we
have
a right to
slay
an
enemy
only when
it is
impossible to enslave him , the right to enslave him is not derived
from the right to kill him ; it is, therefore , an iniquitous
bargain
to make
him purchase
his life , over which the victor has no right ,
at the
cost of his
liberty.
In establishing
the
right of life and
death upon the right of slavery , and the right of slavery upon the
right of life
and death , is it not manifest
that
one falls into a
vicious circle ?
Even if we grant this
terrible
right of killing
everybody , I say
that
a slave
made
in war , or a conquered
nation , is
under
no
obligation at all to a master , except
to
obey him
so far as
com-
pelled .
In taking an
equivalent
for his
life the victor has con-
ferred no favour on the slave ; instead of killing him unprofitably
,
he has
destroyed
him for
his
own
advantage .
Far , then , from
having
acquired
over him any
authority
in addition to that of
force, the
state
of war
subsists
between them as before , their
relation_even is the effect of it ; and the exercise
of the rights of
war supposes
that there is no treaty of peace .
They have
made
a
convention.
Be it so ; but this convention
, far from terminating
the state of war , supposes its continuance
.
Thus, in whatever
way we regard things , the right of slavery is
invalid , not only because it is illegitimate , but because it is absurd
and
meaningless .
These terms , slavery
and
right, are
contra-
dictory and
mutually
exclusive .
Whether addressed by a man to
a man , or by a man to a nation , such a speech
as this will always
be equally
foolish : " I make

Consequently, before

CHAPTER VII.
THE SOVEREIGN.32
WE see from
this
formula
that the act of
association
contains
a reciprocal engagement
between the public and individuals, and
that
every
individual,
contracting
so to
speak
with himself, is
engaged in a double
relation , viz . as a member
of the
sovereign
towards
individuals, and
as a member of the State towards
the
sovereign .
But
we
cannot
apply
here
the
maxim
of civil law
that
no one is bound by engagements
made with himself; for
there is a great difference
between
being bound to oneself
and to
a whole of which one forms part .
We must further
observe
that
the public resolution
which can
bind all subjects
to the
sovereign
in
consequence
of the two
different
relations
under which
each of them
is regarded
cannot ,
for a contrary
reason , bind the
sovereign
to itself ;
and that
accordingly
it is contrary
to the nature of the body politic for the
sovereign
to impose
on itself a law which it cannot
transgress .
As it can only be considered
under
one
and
the
same
relation ,
it is in the position
of
an individual contracting
with
himself ;
whence
we see that there
is not , nor can
be, any kind of funda-
mental
law binding upon
the
body of the
people , not
even the
social contract .
This
does not imply that
such
a body cannot
perfectly
well
enter into engagements
with others
in what
does
not derogate from this contract
; for, with
regard
to foreigners , it
becomes
a simple being , an individual .
But the body politic or sovereign , deriving
its
existence
only
from
the sanctity
of
the contract
,
can never bind itself
,
even
to
others
,
in
anything
that
derogates
from the original
act
,
such
as
alienation
of some
portion
of
itself
,
or submission
to
another
sovereign
.
To violate
the
act by which
it
exists would be to
annihilate
itself
;
and what
is
nothing produces
nothing
.
So soon
as
the multitude
is
thus united
in
one
body
,
it
is
impossible
to
injure
one
of
the
members
without attacking
the
body
,
still less
to
injure the body without
the members feeling
the
effects
.
Thus duty and interest
alike
oblige the two
contracting
112


The Sovereign .
113
parties to give mutual
assistance ; and the men themselves
should
seek to
combine
in this twofold relationship
all the advantages
which are attendant
on it.
Now , the sovereign , being formed
only of the individuals
that
compose
it, neither
has nor
can
have
any
interest
contrary
to
theirs ;
consequently
the
sovereign
power needs
no guarantee
towards
its subjects , because it is impossible
that the body should
wish to injure all its members
; and we shall
see hereafter
that it
can injure no one as an individual.
The sovereign , for the simple
reason that it is so, is always everything
that it ought to be.
But this is not the
case
as regards
the relation
of subjects
to
the sovereign , which, notwithstanding
the common
interest , would
have no security for the performance
of their engagements , unless
it found means to ensure their fidelity.
Indeed , every individual may , as a man , have
a particular
will
contrary
to , or divergent
from , the general will which
he has as a
citizen ; his private
interest
may
prompt
him
quite
differently
from
the
common
interest
;
his
absolute
and
naturally
inde-
pendent
existence
may make
him
regard
what
he
owes
to the
common
cause as a gratuitous
contribution
, the loss of which will
be less harmful
to others than the payment
of it will be burden-
some to him ;
and , regarding
the moral
person
that constitutes
the State as an imaginary
being because it is not a man , he would
be willing to enjoy
the rights of a citizen
without
being willing to
fulfil the duties
of
a subject .
The
progress
of such
injustice
would bring about the ruin of the body politic .
In order , then , that the
social
pact
may not be a vain
formu-
lary , it tacitly includes
this
engagement , which
can
alone
give
force to the others ,
that
whoever
refuses to obey
the
general
will
shall
be
constrained
to do
so by the whole
body ;
which
means nothing
else than
that he shall
be forced
to be free ; for
such is the condition which, uniting every
citizen
to
his
native
land, guarantees
him from
all personal
dependence , a condition
that
ensures
the control and working of the political machine ,
and alone
renders
legitimate
civil
engagements , which, without
it, would
be
absurd
and
tyrannical ,
and
subject
to the
most
enormous
abuses .

'APTER VIII .
THE
CIVIL
STATE.
THE passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces in
man
a very remarkable
change , by substituting
in his conduct
justice for instinct, and
by giving his actions
the moral
quality
that they previously
lacked.33
It is only when the voice of duty
succeeds physical impulse , and law succeeds
appetite , that man ,
who till then had regarded only himself, sees that he is obliged
to
other principles , and to consult
his reason before listening
to his inclinations.
Although , in this
state, he
is
deprived
of
many advantages
that he derives from
nature , he acquires equally
great
ones in return
; his faculties
are exercised
and developed
;
his ideas are expanded
; his feelings
are ennobled
; his whole soul
s exalted to such a degree that , if the abuses
of this new condi-
tion did not
often
degrade
him
below that from which he
has
emerged , he
ought to
bless without ceasing the happy
moment
that
released
him
from
it for
ever, and
transformed
him from
a stupid
and
ignorant
animal
into
an intelligent
being
and
a
man .
Let us
reduce
this whole balance
to terms
easy to compare .
What
man
loses
by the social
contract
is his natural
liberty and
an unlimited right to anything which tempts him and which
he
is
able
to
attain ;
what he gains is civil liberty and property
in all
that he possesses .
In
order
that we may not be mistaken
about
these
compensations
, we
must
clearly
distinguish
natural
liberty ,
which is limited only by the powers of the individual , from civil
liberty , which is
limited
by the
general
will ;
and
possession ,
which
is nothing but the
result
of
force
or the right of first
occupancy , from
property , which can be based
only on a positive
title .
Besides the preceding , we might
add to the acquisitions
of the
civil state moral freedom , which alone
renders
man
truly master
of himself;
for the
impulse
of mere
appetite
is slavery , while
obedience
to a self-prescribed
law is liberty.
But I have
already
said too much on this head , and the philosophical meaning
of the
term liberty does not belong
to my present
subject .

CHAPTER IX,
REAL PROPERTY.34
EVERY member of the community
at the moment of its formation
gives
himself up to it, just as he actually
is , himself and all his
powers , of which the property
that
he possesses forms part .
By
this
act, possession
does not change
its
nature when
it
changes
hands
,
and become
property
in
those
of
the sovereign
;
but
,
as
the powers
of
the State
(
cité
)
are incomparably
greater than
those
of an
individual
,
public
possession
is
also
,
in
fact
,
more secur
and
more
irrevocable
,
without
being more legitimate
,
at
least
respect
of foreigners
;
for the State
,
with regard
to
its members
is
owner of all their property
by the social
contract
,
which
,
in
the
State
,
serves
as
the basis
of
all rights
;
but with regard
to
other
powers
,
it
is
owner
only by the right
of
first occupancy
which
it
derives from individuals
.
The
right of first occupancy
,
although_more_real_than
that
of the strongest
,
becomes
a
true right only after the establishment
of that of property
.
Every man
has by nature
a
right
to
all that
is
necessary
to
him
;
but the positive
act
which makes
him pro-
prietor
of
certain
property
excludes
him from
all the
residue
.
His portion
having
been allotted
,
he ought
to
confine
himself
to
it,
and he has no
further
right
to
the undivided property
.
That
is
why the right
of
first occupancy
,
so
weak
in
the state
of
nature
,
is
respected
by
every
member
of
a
State
.
In this right men
regard
not
so
much what
belongs
to
others
as
what
does not
belong to themselves
.
In order
to
legalize
the
right
of
first
occupancy
over
any
domain whatsoever
,
the following conditions
are
,
in
general
,
neces-
sary
:
first
,
the
land
must
not yet
be
inhabited
by
any
one
;
secondly
,
a
man
must
occupy
only the area required
for his sub-
sistence
;
thirdly
,
he must take possession
of
it,
not by an empty
ceremony
,
but by labour and cultivation
,
the only mark
of
owner-
ship which
,
in
default
of legal title
,
ought
to
be
respected
by
others
.
Indeed
,
if
we
accord the right
of
first occupancy
to
necessity
115


116
The Social Contract .
and labour , do
we not
extend
it
as
far
as it
can
go ?
Is it
impossible
to assign limits to this right ?
Will the mere
setting
foot on common
ground
be sufficient
to give an immediate
claim
to the ownership
of it ?
Will the
power
of driving away other
men from it for a moment
suffice to deprive them for ever of the
right of returning
to it ?
How can a man or a people take posses-
sion of an immense
territory
and rob the whole
human
race of it
except by a punishable
usurpation , since other
men are deprived
of the place of residence
and the sustenance which nature gives to
them in common ?
When Nuñez
Balbao
35 on the sea-shore took
possession
of the
Pacific
Ocean
and
of the
whole
of South
America in the name of the crown of Castille , was this sufficient
to dispossess all the inhabitants
, and exclude from it all the princes
in the world ?
On this supposition , such
ceremonies
might
have
been multiplied
vainly
enough
;
and the Catholic king in his
cabinet
might , by a single
stroke ,
have
taken
possession
of the
whole world, only cutting off afterwards from
his empire what was
previously
occupied
by other princes .
We perceive
how the
lands
of individuals,
united
and
con-
tiguous , become public territory , and how the right of sovereignty ,
extending
itself from the subjects to the land which
they occupy ,
becomes at once real and personal
; which
places
the possessors
in greater
dependence , and
makes their own powers a guarantee
for their fidelity—an advantage which ancient
monarchs
do not
appear to have
clearly
perceived , for,
calling themselves
only
kings of the
Persians
or Scythians
or Macedonians
, they
seem to
have regarded
themselves
as chiefs of men rather than as
owners
of countries .
Monarchs of to -day call
themselves
more
cleverly
kings
of France , Spain , England , etc.;
in thus
holding the land
they are quite sure of holding
its
inhabitants
.
36
The
peculiarity
of
this
alienation
is
that the
community
,
in
receiving the property
of
individuals
,
so
far from robbing them of
it,
only assures
them
lawful possession
,
and
changes
usurpation
into true right
,
enjoyment
into ownership
.
Also
,
the
possessors
being considered
as
depositaries
of
the public property
,
and their
rights being respected
by all the members
of
the State
,
as
well
as
maintained
by
all
its
power
against
foreigners
,
they have
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
transfer
advantageous
to
the public and still more to
themselves
,
acquired
all
that
they have
given
up
-
a
paradox
57
which
is
easily
explained
by
distinguishing
between
the
rights
which the
sovereign
and
the
proprietor
have
over
the
same
property
,
as we shall
see hereafter
.
38
It
may also happen
that men begin
to
unite before they possess
1

CHAPTER III.
WHETHER
THE GENERAL WILL CAN ERR .
It follows
from what
precedes
that the general will
is
always
right
and always tends to the public advantage ; but it does not
follow that the resolutions
of the
people have always
the same
rectitude .
Men always desire their own good , but do not
always
discern it ; the people
are never corrupted , though
often deceived ,
and it is only then that they seem to will what is evil.
There is often a great deal of difference
between the will of all
and the general will ; the latter regards only the common
interest ,
while the former
has regard
to
private
interests , and is merely a
sum of particular
wills ; but
take away from these same wills the
pluses and minuses which cancel
one another ,* and the general
will remains
as the sum of the differences .
If the people
came to a resolution
when adequately
informed
and without
any communication
among the citizens , the
general
will would always
result
from the
great
number
of
slight
differ-
ences ,
and
the
resolution
would always
be
good .
But
when
factions , partial
associations , are formed
to the detriment
of the
whole
society , the will of each of these
associations
becomes
general with reference
to
its
members , and
particular
with
refer-
ence to the State ; it may then be
said
that
there
are
no
longer
as many voters as there are men , but only as many voters as there
are
associations .
The
differences
become
less
numerous
and
yield a less general result .
Lastly, when one of these associations
becomes
so great
that it predominates
over
all the rest , you no
longer have as the result
a sum of small
differences , but a single
"Every interest ," says the
Marquis
d'Argenson ,8 " has different
principles .
The accord of two particular interests is formed by oppo-
sition to that of a third."
He
might
have added that the accord of
all interests is formed
by opposition
to that of each.
Unless there
were
different
interests , the common
interest
would
scarcely be felt
and would
never meet with
any
obstacle ; everything
would
go of
itself, and politics would cease to be an art .
123

difference
;
there
is
then no longer
a
general will
,
and the opinion
which prevails
is
only
a
particular
opinion
.
It
is
important
,
then
,
in
order
to
have
a
clear declaration
of the
general
will
,
that
there
should be
no
partial
association
in
the
State
,
and
that
every
citizen
should
express
only
his
own
opinion
.*
Such was the
unique
and
sublime
institution
of
the
great Lycurgus.9
But
if
there are partial
associations
,
it
is
neces-
sary
to
multiply their
number
and
prevent
inequality
,
as
Solon
,
Numa
,
and Servius did
.
These are the
only proper
precautions
for ensuring
that the general will may always be enlightened
,
and
that the people
may not be deceived
.
"
It
is
true
,"
says
Machiavelli
,
"
that
some
divisions
injure the
State
,
while some are beneficial
to
it;
those are injurious
to
it
which
are accompanied
by cabals and factions
;
those assist
it
which
are
maintained
without
cabals
,
without
factions
.
Since
,
therefore
,
no
founder of
a
State can provide against enmities
in
it,
he ought
at
least
to
provide
that there shall
be no cabals

THE LIMITS
OF THE
SOVEREIGN
POWER .
IF the
State
or
city is nothing but a moral
person , the life of
which
consists
in the union of its
members ,
and if the
most
important of its
cares is that of self-preservation , it
needs
a
universal and compulsive
force to move and dispose every part in
the manner
most expedient
for the whole .
As nature gives every
man an absolute power overall his limbs , the social pact gives the
body politic an absolute
power
over
all its
members ; and
it is
this same power which , when directed
by the general will, bears,
as I said , the name of sovereignty .
But besides the public person , we have to consider
the private
persons who
who compose it, and whose
life and liberty are naturally
independent of it.
The question , then , is to
distinguish
clearly
between
the
respective
rights
of the citizens
and of the
sove-
reign,
as well as between the duties which the former
have to
fulfil in their capacity
as subjects
and the natural rights
which
they ought to enjoy in their character
as men .
10
It is admitted
that whatever
part of his power , property , and
liberty each
one
alienates
by the
social
compact
is only that
part 11 of the whole of which the
use is
important
to
the com-
munity
; but we must also admit that the sovereign
alone is judge
of what is important .
All the services that
a citizen
can render to the State he owes
to it as soon as the sovereign
demands
them ; but the sovereign ,
on
its
part
,
cannot
impose
on
its
subjects
any burden which
is
useless
to
the community
;
it
cannot
even wish
to
do
so
,
12
for
,
by
the law
of
reason
,
just
as
by the law
of
nature
,
nothing
is
done
without
a
cause
.
The engagements which bind
us
to
the social body are obliga-
tory only because they are mutual
;
and their nature
is
such that

but wait

125


126
The Social Contract .
in fulfilling them we cannot work for others without
also working
for ourselves .
Why is the general will
always right , and why do
all invariably
desire
the
prosperity
of each , unless
it is
because
there is no one
but appropriates
to himself this word
each
and
thinks of himself in voting
on behalf of all ?
This
proves that
equality of rights
and the notion
of justice
that
it
produces
are
derived
from the
preference
which
each
gives
to himself, and
consequently
from man's nature ; that the general will , to be truly
such , should
be
so in
its object as well as in its essence ; that it
ought to proceed
from
all in
order
to be applicable
to all ; and
that it loses its natural
rectitude
when it tends to some individual
and determinate
object , because in that case , judging of what
is
unknown to us,
we
have
no
true
principle of equity
to guide
us.
Indeed , so soon as a particular
fact or right is in question
with
regard
to a point which has
not been
regulated
by an anterior
general
convention , the
matter
becomes
contentious
; it is
a
process
in which the
private
persons
interested
are one of the
parties and the public the other , but in which I perceive
neither
the law which
must be followed , nor the judge who should
decide .
It would be ridiculous
in such
a case to wish to refer the matter
for an express decision
of the general will , which can be nothing
but the decision
of one of the parties , and which , consequently
, is
for the other party only a will that is foreign , partial , and inclined
on such an occasion
to injustice
as well
as liable to error .
There-
fore , just as a particular
will cannot
represent the general will, the
general will in turn changes
its
nature
when
it
has
a
particular
end
,
and cannot
,
as
general
,
decide
about
either
a
person
or
a
fact
.
When the people
of
Athens
,
for instance
,
elected
or
de-
posed their chiefs
,
decreed
honours
to
one
,
imposed
penalties
on
another
,
and by multitudes
of
particular
decrees
exercised
indis-
criminately
all the functions
of
government
,
the people no longer
had any general will properly
so
called
;
they
no
longer
acted
as
a
sovereign
power
,
but
as
magistrates
.
This will appear
contrary
to
common
ideas
,
but
I
must
be
allowed
time
to
expound
my
Own.13
From this we must understand
that what generalises
the will
is
not so much the number of voices
as
the common
interest which
unites them
;
for
,
under this
system
,
each
necessarily
submits
to
the
conditions
which he imposes
on others
—
an admirable
union
of
interest
and justice
,
which gives
to
the deliberations
of
the
community
a
spirit
of
equity that
seems
to
disappear
in
the dis-
cussion
of
any private
affair
,
for want
of
a
common
interest

Power.
127
unite and
identify
the ruling principle of the judge with
that of
the party .
By whatever
path we return
to our principle we always
arrive
at the same
conclusion
, viz . that
the social
compact
establishes
among the citizens
such
an
equality
that
they all pledge
thern-
selves
under the same
conditions
and
ought
all to enjoy the
same
rights .
Thus, by the nature of the compact , every act of
sovereignty , that is , every authentic
act of the general will , binds
or favours
equally all the
citizens
; so that
the sovereign
knows
only the body of the nation , and distinguishes
none of those that
compose
it.
What , then , is an act of sovereignty
properly
so called ? It is
not an agreement
between
a superior
and
an
inferior , but
an
agreement of the body with
each of its members
;
a lawful
agree-
ment , because
it has the social
contract
as its foundation
; equit-
able , because it is common
to all ;
useful , because it can have no
other object than
the general welfare
; and stable , because it has
the public force and the supreme
power
as a guarantee .
So long
as the subjects
submit
only to
such
conventions , they obey no
one, but simply their own will ; and to ask how far the respective
rights of the sovereign
and citizens
extend
is to
ask up to what
point the latter
can
make
engagements
among themselves , each
with all and all with each .
Thus we see that the sovereign
power , wholly absolute , wholly
sacred , and wholly inviolable
as
it
is, does not , and
cannot , pass
the limits of general
conventions
, and that every man
can fully
dispose of what is left to him of his property and liberty by these
conventions
; so that the sovereign
never
has
a
right
to
burden
one subject
more than
another , because then the matter becomes
particular and his power is no longer competent .
These
distinctions
once
admitted , so untrue
is it that in the
social contract
there
is
on the part
of individuals any real
re-
nunciation
, that their situation , as a result of this
contract , is in
reality
preferable
to what
it
was
before , and
that , instead
of an
alienation
, they have only made an advantageous
exchange of an
uncertain and precarious
mode of existence for a better and more
assured one , of natural
independence
for liberty, of the power to
injure
others
for their
own
safety , and
of their
strength , which
others might overcome , for a right which the social union renders
inviolable.
Their
lives ,
also , which they
have
devoted
to the
State , are continually protected
by it ; and in exposing
their lives
for its defence , what
do they do but
restore
what
they have re-
ceived
from it ?
What do they do but what they would
do more


128
The Social Contract .
frequently
and with
more risk in the
state
of nature , when , en-
gaging in inevitable
struggles , they would defend
at the peril of
their lives their means of preservation
?
All have to fight for their
country in case of need , it is
true ; but then no
one
ever has to
fight for himself.
Do
we not
gain , moreover , by incurring, for
what
ensures
our safety , a
part of the risks
that we should
have
to incur for ourselves individually , as soon as
we were
deprived
ofit? 14


CHAPTER
V.
THE RIGHT
OF LIFE AND DEATH .
It may be asked
how individuals who
have no right to dispose
of their
own lives can
transmit
to the sovereign
this right which
they do not possess .
The
question
appears
hard
to
solve only
because
it is
badly
stated .
Every man
has
a right to risk his
own life in order to preserve it.
Has it ever been said that one
who throws
himself out of a window to
escape
from
a fire is
guilty of suicide
?
Has this
crime , indeed , ever
been
imputed
to a man
who
perishes
in
a storm , although , on
embarking , he
was not ignorant
of the danger ?
The social
treaty has as
its
end the
preservation
of
the con-
tracting
parties
.
He who desires the end desires also the means
,
and
some
risks
,
even
some
losses
,
are
inseparable
from
these
means
.
He who
is
willing
to
preserve
his life
at
the expense
of
others ought
also
to
give
it
up for them
when necessary
.
Now
,
the citizen
is
not
a
judge
of
the peril
to
which
the law requires
that he should
expose himself
;
and
when the prince
has said
to
him
:
"
It
is
expedient
for the
State
that
you
should
die
,"
he
ought
to
die
,
since
it
is
only on this condition that
he has lived
in
security
up
to
that time
,
and since his life
is
no longer
merely
a
gift
of
nature
,
but
a
conditional
gift
of
the State
.
The penalty
of
death
inflicted
on criminals
may be regarded
almost from the same point
of
view
;
it
is
in
order not
to
be the
victim
of an assassin that
a
man
consents
to die
if
he becomes
one
.
In this treaty
,
far from disposing
of his own
life
,
he thinks
only
of
securing
it,
and
it
is
not
to
be supposed
that any of the
contracting
parties contemplates
at
the time being hanged
.
Moreover
,
every
evil
-
doer who
attacks
social
rights
becomes
by his crimes
a
rebel
and
a
traitor
to
his
country
;
by violating
its laws he ceases to
be
a
member
of
it,
and
even
makes
war
upon
it
.
Then the preservation
of
the State
is
incompatible
with
his own
-
one
of
the two
must
perish
;
and
when
a
guilty
man
is
executed
,
it
is
less
as
a
citizen
than
as
an
enemy
.
The pro-
ceedings
and the judgment are the
proofs
and
the
declaration
i
129
K


130
The Social Contract .
that he has broken
the social
treaty , and
consequently
that he is
no longer
a member of the State .
Now , as he has acknowledged
himself to be such , at least by his
residence , he ought to be cut
off from it by exile
as a violator of the compact , or by death
as a
public enemy ; for such
an enemy is not a moral
person , he is
simply a man ; and
this
is a case in which the right of war is to
slay the vanquished
.
But, it will
be
said , the
condemnation
of a criminal is
a par-
ticular act.
Granted
; but this
condemnation
does
not
belong
to the sovereign
;
it is
a right which that power
can
confer , `
though itself unable
to exercise it.
All
my ideas are connected ,
but I could not expound
them all at once .
Again, the frequency
of capital
punishments
is always
a sign
of weakness
or indolence
in the
government .
There is no man
so worthless
that he cannot
be made good for something .
have
a right
to kill ,
even for
example's
sake , only those
who
cannot
be preserved
without
danger .
In
;;
As regards the right to pardon
or to exempt
a guilty
man from
the penalty
imposed
by the law and
inflicted
by the judge, it
belongs
only to a power which is above
both the judge and the
law, that
is to
say, the sovereign
; still
its
right
in
this
is
not
very plain
,
and the
occasions for exercising
it
are very rare
.
a
well
-
governed
State
there
are few punishments
,
not because
many pardons
are granted
,
but because
there are few criminals
the multitude
of
crimes
ensures
impunity
when the
State
is
decaying
.
Under the Roman Republic
neither
the Senate
nor
the
consuls
attempted
to
grant
pardons
;
the
people
even
did
not grant any
,
although
they
sometimes
revoked
their own judg-
ments
.
Frequent pardons
proclaim
that
crimes will
soon
need
them
no longer
,
and every one sees
to
what
that leads.15
But
I
feel my heart
murmuring
and
restraining
my pen
;
let
us
leave
these questions
to
be discussed by the just man who has not erred
,
and who never needed pardon
himself
.

CHAPTER VI.
THE LAW.
By the social compact
we have
given
existence
and life to the
body politic ; the question
now is to
endow
it with movement
and will by legislation .
For the original
act by which this body
is formed and consolidated
determines
nothing in addition as to
what it must do for its own preservation .
What is right
and conformable
to
order
is such by the nature
of things , and independently
of human
conventions
.
All justice
comes from God , he
alone
is the
source
of it ;
but
could
we
receive it direct
from so lofty a source , we should
need
neither
government
nor laws .
Without doubt there is a universal
justice
emanating
from reason
alone ; but
this
justice , in
order
to be
admitted
among
us,
should
be
reciprocal .
Regarding things
from
a human
standpoint ,
the laws
of
justice
are inoperative
among
men for want of a natural
sanction
; they only bring
good
to the wicked and
evil to the just when the latter
observe
them
with
every
one ,
and
no
one
observes them in
return .
Con-
ventions
and
laws , then ,
are
necessary
to
couple
rights
with
duties
and apply justice to its object .
In the state of nature ,
where
everything
is in common , I owe nothing to those to whom
I have
promised
nothing ; I recognize
as
belonging
to
others
only what
is useless to
me.
This is not the
case in the civil
state , in which all rights are determined
by law.
But then , finally , what is a law ?
So long as men are content
to attach to this word only metaphysical
ideas , 16 they will
con-
tinue
to argue
without
being
understood
; and when they
have
stated what a law of nature is, they will
know no
better what
a
law of the State is.
I have already
said that
there is no general will with reference
to a particular
object .
In fact , this
particular
object
is either in
the State or outside of it.
If it is outside
the State , a will which
is foreign to it is not general in relation
to it ; and if it is within
the State , it forms part
of it ; then there is formed
between the
whole and
its
part
a relation
which makes
of it
two
separate
131


132
The Social Contract .
beings , of which
the part
is one , and
the whole , less this same
part , is the other .
But the whole
less one part
is not the whole,
and so long as the relation
subsists , there is no longer any whole,
but
two unequal
parts ; whence
it follows
that the will of the one
is no longer
general in relation to the other .
But when
the
whole
people
decree
concerning
the
whole
people , they consider
themselves
alone ; and if a relation
is then
constituted , it is between
the whole
object
under one
point of
view and
the whole
object
under another point of view , without
any
division at all.
Then
the matter
respecting
which
they
decree is general like the will that decrees .
It is this act that I
call a law.
When I say that
the
object
of the laws is always
general , I
mean that the law considers
subjects
collectively
, and
actions
as
abstract , never
a man as an
individual nor
a particular
action .
Thus the law may indeed
decree that
there shall be privileges ,
but cannot
confer
them
on any
person
by name ; the
law can
create
several classes of citizens , and
even
assign the
qualifica-
tions
which shall
entitle
them
to rank in these
classes , but it
cannot
nominate
such and such persons to be
admitted
to them ;
it can establish
a royal government
and a hereditary
succession ,
but cannot
elect a king or appoint
a royal family
; in a word , no
function which has reference
to an individual object appertains
to the legislative
power.
From this standpoint
we see immediately
that
it is no longer
necessary to ask
whose office it is to
make laws , since
they are
acts of the
general
will ; nor whether
the
prince
is above
the
laws , since
he is a member
of the
State ; nor whether
the law
can
be unjust, since
no one is unjust to himself; nor how we
are free and
yet
subject
to
the
laws , since
the
laws
are only
registers of our wills 17
We
see, further , that
since the law combines
the universality
of the will with the universality
of the object , whatever
any man
prescribes on his own authority
is not a law ; and
whatever the
sovereign itself prescribes
respecting
a particular
object is not a
law, but a decree , not an act of sovereignty , but of magistracy .
I therefore call any State a republic which is governed
by laws,
under whatever form of administration
it may be ; for then only
does the
public
interest
predominate
and the
commonwealth
count for something .
Every legitimate
government
is republi-
can ; I will explain
hereafter what government
is.18
*
* I do not mean by this
word
an aristocracy or democracy only,

The Law.
133
Laws
are properly
only the
conditions
of
civil
association .
The people , being
subjected
to
the
laws , should
be the authors
of them ; it concerns
only the
associates
to determine
the
con-
ditions of association .
But how will they
be determined
?
Will
it be by a common
agreement , by a sudden
inspiration ?
Has
the body politic
an organ for expressing
its
will
?
Who will give
it
the foresight
necessary
to
frame
its
acts
and
publish
them
at the outset
?
Or how shall
it
declare them in the hour of need
?
How would
a
blind
multitude
,
which
often
knows
not
what
it
wishes
because
it
rarely knows
what
is
good for
it,
execute
of
itself an enterprise
so
great
,
so
difficult
,
as
a
system
of
legisla-
tion
?
Ofthemselves
,
the people always desire what
is
good
,
but
do not always discern
it
.
The
general
will
is
always
right
,
but
the judgment
which
guides
it
is
not always enlightened
.
It
must
be made
to
see objects
as
they are
,
sometimes
as
they ought
to
appear
;
it
must
be
shown the good
path that
it
is
seeking
,
and
guarded
from the seduction
of
private
interests
;
it
must be made
to
observe
closely
times and places
,
and
to
balance
the attraction
of
immediate
and
palpable
advantages
against
the
danger
of
remote
and
concealed
evils
.
Individuals
see the
good
which
they reject
;
the public desire
the
good
which they
do not see
.
All alike have
need
of
guides
.
The former
must
be
compelled
to conform
their wills
to
their reason
;
the
people
must be taught
to know what they require
.
Then from
the public enlighten-
ment results the union
of
the
understanding
and the will
in
the
social
body
;
and
from
that
the close
co
-
operation
of
the parts
,
and
,
lastly
,
the maximum
power of the whole
.
Hence
arises the
need of
a
legislator
.
but
in
general any government
directed by the general will
,
which
is
the law
.
To be
legitimate
,
the government
must not
be combined
with the sovereign power
,
but must be its minister
;
then monarchy
itself
is
a
republic
.
This will be made clear
in
the next book
.


CHAPTER VII .
THE LEGISLATOR.¹
1
In order to discover
the rules of association
that are most suitable
to nations , a superior
intelligence
would
be necessary who could
see all the
passions
of men
without
experiencing
any of them ;
who would
have
no
affinity
with
our
nature
and yet know
it
thoroughly ; whose
happiness
would not
depend
on us, and who
would nevertheless
be
quite
willing to interest
himself
in ours ;
and, lastly , one who , storing
up for himself with the progress
of
time a far -off glory
in the
future , could
labour in
one
age and
enjoy in another .*
Gods would be
necessary
to
give
laws
to
men .
The same argument
that Caligula 20 adduced
as to fact , Plato 21
put forward with regard
to
right , in order to give an
idea of the
civil or royal man whom he is in quest of in his work the States-
man .
But if it is true
that
a great
prince is a rare man , what
will a great legislator
be ?
The first has only to follow the model
which the
other
has to frame .
The latter is the
mechanician
who invents
the
machine , the former
is
only the workman
who
puts it in readiness
and works it. "In the birth of societies ," says
Montesquieu
,22 " it
is the chiefs
of the
republics
who
frame the
institutions
, and afterwards it is the institutions
which mould the
chiefs ofthe republics ."
He
who
dares
undertake
to
give
institutions
to
a nation
ought
to
feel himself capable ,
as it
were , of changing
human
nature ; of transforming
every individual , who
in himself is
a
complete
and
independent
whole , into
part
of a greater whole,
from which he receives in some manner his life and his being ; of
altering
man's constitution
in order to strengthen
it ; of substitut-
ing a social and moral
existence for the independent
and physical
* A nation becomes famous only
when its legislation
is beginning
to decline.23
We are ignorant during how many centuries the institu-
tions of Lycurgus
conferred
happiness
on the Spartans
before they
were known in the rest of Greece.

existence which we have all received from
nature .
In a word, it is
order to endow
necessary to deprive
man of his native
powers in
him with some which are
alien to him, and of which he cannot
make use without
the aid of other people .
The more thoroughly
those natural
powers
are
deadened
and
destroyed , the
greater
and more
durable
are the
acquired
powers , the
more solid
and
perfect
also are the institutions
; so that if every citizen
is nothing ,
and can be nothing, except in combination
with all the rest, and
if the force
acquired
by the whole
be
equal
or superior
to the
sum of the natural
forces of all the individuals, we may say that
legislation
is
at the
highest
point of perfection
which it
can
attain.24
The
legislator
is in all
respects
an
extraordinary
man in the
State . If he ought to be so by his genius , he is not less so by his
office . It is not magistracy nor sovereignty .
This
office , which
constitutes
the republic, does not
enter into
its
constitution
;
it
is
a
special
and superior
office
,
having
nothing
in
common
with
human
government
;
for
,
if
he who rules men ought not
to
control
legislation
,
he who controls
legislation
ought
not
to
rule
men
;
otherwise
his
laws
,
being
ministers
of
his
passions
,
would
often
serve only
to
perpetuate
his acts
of
injustice
;
he would
never be
able
to
prevent
private interests from corrupting
the sacredness
of
his work
.

When Lycurgus gave laws
to
his
country
,
he began by abdicat-
ing his royalty
.
It
was the practice
of
the majority
of
the Greek
towns
to entrust to foreigners
the framing
of their laws
.
The
modern republics
of
Italy often imitated
this usage
;
that
of
Geneva
did the same
and
found
it
advantageous
.
*
Rome
,
at
her most
glorious
epoch
,
saw all the
crimes
of
tyranny spring
up
in
her
bosom
,
and saw herself on the verge of destruction
,
through
unit-
ing
in
the same hands
legislative
authority
27
and sovereign
power
.
Yet the
Decemvirs
themselves
never
arrogated
the
right
to
pass
any law on their sole authority
.
Nothing that we
propose
to
you
,
they
said
to
the
people
,
can pass into law without
your
consent
.
Romans
,
be yourselves
the
authors
of
the laws which
are
to
secure your happiness

Those who consider
Calvin
26
only
as
a
theologian
are but little
acquainted with the extent
of
his genius
.
The preparation
of
our wise
edicts
,
in
which he had
a
large share
,
does
him as much credit
as
his
Institutes
.
Whatever
revolution time may bring about
in
our religion
,
so
long
as
love
of
country and
of
liberty
is
not extinct among
us
,
the
memory of that great man will not cease
to
be revered
.


136
The Social Contract .
He who frames laws , then , has, or ought to have, no legislative
right , and the people
themselves
cannot ,
even if they
wished ,
divest themselves of this
incommunicable
right, because , accord-
ing to the fundamental
compact , it is
only the
general
will that
binds individuals, and we can never be sure that
a particular will
is conformable
to the general will until it has been
submitted
to
the free votes of the
people . I have
said this already , but it is
not useless to repeat it.
Thus we find
simultaneously
in the
work of legislation
two
things
that
seem
incompatible -an
enterprise
surpassing
human
powers , and , to execute it, an authority
that is a mere nothing.
Another difficulty
deserves attention .
Wise men who
want to
speak to the vulgar in their own language instead
of in a popular
way will not be understood .
Now , there
are a thousand
kinds of
ideas which it is impossible
to translate
into the
language of the
people .
Views very
general
and
objects
very
remote
are alike
beyond its
reach ; and
each
individual, approving
of no other
plan of government
than that
which promotes
his own interests ,
does not readily
perceive the benefits that he is to derive from the
continual deprivations
which
good
laws
impose .
In order _that
a newly formed nation
might
approve
sound
maxims of politics
and
observe
the fundamental
rules
of state-policy , it would be
necessary that the effect should
become the cause ; that the social
spirit , which
should
be the work of the institution
, should
preside
over the institution
itself, and
that
men
should
be, prior to the
laws , what they ought to become by means of them .
Since , then,
the legislator
cannot
employ
either
force
or reasoning , he must
needs have
recourse
to
an
authority
of a different
order , which
can compel
without
violence
and persuade without
convincing
.
It is this which in all
ages
has
constrained
the
founders
of
nations
to resort
to the
intervention
of heaven , and
to give the
gods the credit for their own wisdom , in order
that
the nations ,
subjected
to the
laws
of the
State
as to
those
of nature , and
recognising
the same power
in the formation
of man
and in that
of the State , might
obey willingly , and bear submissively
the yoke
of the public welfare.28
The
legislator
puts
into the
mouths
of the
immortals
that
sublime reason which soars beyond
the reach of common
men , in
order that he may win over by divine authority
those whom human
prudence
could
not move .*
But it does not belong to every man
* 66It is true," says Machiavelli , " there
never
was in a nation any
promulgator
of extraordinary
laws
who
had
not recourse to
God ,
The Legislator.
137
29
to make the gods
his oracles , nor
to
be believed
when
he pro-
claims
himself their
interpreter .
The
great soul of the legislator
is the real
miracle
which must
give proof of his mission .
Any
man can engrave
tables
of stone , or bribe
an
oracle , or pretend
secret intercourse
with some divinity, or train a bird to speak in
his
ear,
or
find
some
other
clumsy
means
to
impose
on the
people.2
He who is
acquainted
with
such
means
only
will
perchance
be
able
to assemble
a crowd of foolish
persons ; but
he will never
found
an
empire ,
and
his
extravagant
work will
speedily
perish
with
him.
Empty
deceptions
form but
a tran-
sient bond ; it is only wisdom
that makes it lasting .
The Jewish
law, which still endures , and that of the child of Ishmael,30 which
for ten centuries
has ruled half the world , still bear witness to-day
to the great men who dictated
them ; and whilst
proud philosophy
or blind party spirit
sees in them nothing
but fortunate
impostors ,
the true statesman admires in their systems the great
and power-
ful genius which directs durable
institutions
.
It is not necessary
from
all this
to
infer
with
Warburton
31
that
politics
and
religion
have
among
us a common
aim , but
only that , in the origin of nations , one
serves as an instrument
of
the other .
because otherwise they would
not have been accepted ; for there are
many
advantages
recognised
by a wise man
which are not so self-
evident
that they can convince others ” (Discourses on Titus Livius ,
Book I. chapter II).


CHAPTER VIII.
THE PEOPLE .
As an architect , before erecting a large edifice , examines
and tests
the soil in order to see whether
it can support
the weight , so a
wise lawgiver
does not begin by drawing
up laws
that are good in
themselves
, but
considers
first
whether
the people
for whom
he
designs
them
are fit to
endure them .
It is on this account
that
Plato 32 refused
to
legislate
for the
Arcadians and
Cyrenians
,
knowing that these two peoples
were rich and could
not tolerate
equality ; and it is on this account
that good
laws and
worthless
men were to be found in Crete , for
Minos had only disciplined a
people
steeped in vice .
A thousand
nations
that
have
flourished
on the
earth could
never have
borne
good
laws ; and
even
those
that
might
have
done so could
have
succeeded
for only
a very
short
period of
their whole duration .
The majority
of nations , as well as of men ,
are
tractable
only in their
youth
; they
become
incorrigible
as
they grow old.
When
once
customs
are established
and pre-
judices have taken root , it is
a perilous
and futile enterprise
to
try and
reform
them ; for the people
cannot
even
endure
that
their evils should be touched
with a
view to their removal , like
those stupid and cowardly
patients that
shudder
at the sight of a
physician .
But just
as some
diseases
unhinge
men's minds
and deprive
them of
all
remembrance
of
the past
,
so
we sometimes find
,
during
the
existence
of
States
,
epochs
of
violence
,
in
which revolutions
produce
an
influence
upon
nations
such
as
certain
crises produce
upon individuals
,
in
which horror
of
the
past supplies the
place
of
forgetfulness
,
and
in
which the
State
,
inflamed
by
civil
wars
,
springs
forth
so
to
speak from
its
ashes
,
and regains the vigour
of
youth
in
issuing from the arms
of
death
.
Such was Sparta
in
the
time
of
Lycurgus
,
such was Rome
after
the
Tarquins
,
and such
among us moderns
were Holland and Switzerland
after the expul-
sion oftheir tyrants
.
33
But these events
are
rare
;
they are exceptions
,
the explanation
138

The People.
139
7
of which is
always
found
in the
particular
constitution
of the
excepted
State .
They could not even happen twice with the same
nation ; for it may
render
itself free so long as it is merely bar-
barous , but can no longer
do so when the
resources of the State
are exhausted .
Then commotions
may destroy
it without
revolu-
tions being able to restore it, and as soon as
its
chains are broken
,
it
falls
in
pieces
and
ceases
to
exist
;
henceforward
it
requires
a
master
and not
a
deliverer
.
Free
nations
,
remember
this
maxim
:
"
Liberty may be acquired
but never recovered
."
Youth
is
not infancy
.
There
is
for nations
as
for men
a
period
of youth
,
or
,
if
you will
,
of
maturity
,
which they must
await
be-
fore
they are
subjected
to
laws
;
but
it
is
not
always
easy
to
discern
when
a
people
is
mature
,
and
if
the time
is
anticipated
,
the labour
is
abortive
.
One nation
is
governable
from
its
origin
,
another
is
not so at the end of ten
centuries
.
The Russians
will
never
be really
civilized
,
because
they have
been
civilized
too
early
,
34
Peter had
an
imitative
genius
;
he
had
not the true
genius that
creates and
produces
anything
from nothing
.
Some
of his measures
were beneficial
,
but
the majority
were
ill
-
timed
.
He saw that
his people were barbarous
,
but
he did not
see
that
they were unripe for civilization
;
he
wished
to
civilize
them
,
when
it
was necessary only
to
discipline them
.
He wished
to
produce
at
once Germans
or
Englishmen
,
when he should
have begun by
making
Russians
;
he prevented
his subjects
from ever
becoming
what they might
have been
,
by persuading
them that they were
what
they were not
.
It
is
in
this way that
a
French tutor trains
his pupil
to
shine for
a
moment
in
childhood
,
and
then
to
be for
ever
a
nonentity
.
The
Russian Empire will
desire
to
subjugate
Europe
,
and will itself be subjugated
.
The
Tartars
,
its
subjects
or
neighbours
,
will become
its masters and ours
.
This revolution
appears
to
me inevitable
.
All the
kings
of
Europe are working
in concert to accelerate
it
.


CHAPTER
IX .
THE PEOPLE
(continued ).
As nature has set limits
to the stature of a properly
formed
man ,
outside
which it produces
only giants
and dwarfs ; so likewise,
with regard to the best
constitution
of a State , there are limits to
its
possible
extent
so that it may be neither
too great to enable
it to be well governed , nor too small
to enable it to maintain
it-
self single
-
handed
.
(
There
is
in
every body politic
a
maximum
of
force
which
it
cannot
exceed
,
and which
is
often diminished
as
the State
is
aggrandised
.
The more the social bond
is
extended
,
the more
it
is
weakened
;
and
,
in
general
,
a
small
State
is
pro-
portionally
stronger than
a
large one.35
A thousand
reasons demonstrate
the truth of this maxim
.
In
the
first
place
,
administration
becomes
more
difficult
at
great
distances
,
as
a
weight
becomes
heavier
at
the end of
a
longer
lever
.
It
also becomes
more burdensome
in
proportion
as
its
parts are multiplied
;
for every town has first
its own administra-
tion
,
for which the people
pay
;
every district
has its administra-
tion
,
still
paid for by the people
;
next
,
every province
,
then the
superior governments
,
the satrapies
,
the vice
-
royalties
,
which must
be paid for more dearly
as
we ascend
,
and
always
at
the cost of
the unfortunate
people
;
lastly comes the supreme administration
,
which overwhelms
everything
.
So many
additional
burdens
per-
petually
exhaust the subjects
;
and far from being better governed
by all these different
orders
,
they are much worse governed
than
if
they had but
a
single
superior
.
Meanwhile
,
hardly any
re-
sources remain for cases
of
emergency
;
and when
it
is
necessary
to have recourse to them the State trembles
on the brink of ruin
.
Nor
is
this all
;
not only has the government
less vigour and
activity
in
enforcing
observance
of
the laws
,
in
putting
a
stop
to vexations
,
in
reforming
abuses
,
and
in
forestalling
seditious
enterprises
which
may
be
entered
upon
in
distant
places
;
but
the people
have less affection for their chiefs whom they never see
,
for their country
,
which
is
in
their
eyes
like
the world
,
and for
their
fellow
-
citizens
,
most
of
whom are strangers
to
them
.
The
140


The People.
141
same laws
cannot
be
suitable to
so
many
different
provinces ,
which have different
customs
and different
climates , and
cannot
tolerate
the same form of government .
Different
laws beget only
trouble and
confusion
among
the nations
which , living under
the
same chiefs and in constant
communication
, mingle or intermarry
with
one
another , and , when
subjected
to
other
usages , never
know whether
their
patrimony
is really theirs .
Talents are hid-
den , virtues ignored , vices unpunished
, in that
multitude
of men ,
unknown to one
another , whom the seat of the supreme adminis-
tration gathers together
in one
place .
The
chiefs , overwhelmed
with business , see nothing
themselves
; clerks rule the State .
In
a word , the measures that
must be taken to maintain
the
general
authority , which so many officers at a distance
wish to evade or
impose upon, absorb all the public attention
; no
regard
for the
welfare of the
people remains , and scarcely any for their defence
in time
of need ; and
thus a body
too huge for its constitution
sinks and perishes , crushed by
its
own weight
.
On the other hand
,
the State must
secure
a
certain foundation
,
that
it
may possess
stability
and
resist the
shocks which
it
will
infallibly
experience
,
as
well
as
sustain the
efforts
which
it
will
be forced to make
in
order
to
maintain
itself
;
for all nations
have
a
kind
of
centrifugal
force
,
by which they
continually
act
one
against another
,
and tend
to
aggrandise
themselves
at
the expense
of
their neighbours
,
like
the
vortices
of
Descartes.36
Thus the
weak are
in
danger
of
being quickly swallowed
up
,
and
none can
preserve
itself long except
by putting
itself
in
a
kind
of
equili-
brium with all
,
which renders the compression
almost equal every-
where
.
Hence we see that there are reasons for expansion
and reasons
for contraction
;
and
it
is
not the least
of
a
statesman's talents to
find the proportion between the two which
is
most
advantageous
for the preservation of the
State
.
We
may say
,
in
general
,
that
the former
,
being only external and relative
,
ought
to
be subordi-
nated
to
the others
,
which are internal
and absolute
.
A
healthy
and strong
constitution
is
the first thing to be sought
;
and
we
should rely more on the vigour that springs from
a
good govern-
ment than on the resources furnished
by an extensive territory
.
States have
,
however
,
been
constituted
in
such
a
way that the
necessity of making
conquests
entered into their very constitution
,
and
in
order
to
maintain
themselves
they were forced
to
enlarge
themselves
continually
.
Perhaps
they
rejoiced
greatly
at
this
happy
necessity
,
which
nevertheless
revealed
to
them
,
with the
limit
of
their greatness
,
the inevitable
moment
of
their fall
.
37


CHAPTER
X.
THE PEOPLE (continued ).
A BODY politic
may be
measured
in
two ways, viz. by the
ex-
tent of
its
territory
,
and by the number
of
its
people
;
and there
is
between
these
two modes of measurement
a
suitable
relation
according
to
which the State may be assigned
its
true dimensions
.
It
is
the men that constitute
the State
,
and
it
is
the soil that
sus-
tains
the men
;
the due
relation
,
then
,
is
that
the land should
suffice
for
the
maintenance
of
its
inhabitants
,
and
that there
should be
as
many inhabitants
as
the land can
sustain
.
In this
proportion
is
found
the maximum
power
of
a
given number
of
people
;
for
if
there
is
too much
land
,
the
care
of
it
is
burden-
some
,
the
cultivation
inadequate
,
and
the
produce
superfluous
,
and this
is
the proximate
cause
of
defensive wars
.
If there
is
not
enough
land
,
the State
is
at
the mercy
of
its
neighbours
for the
additional
quantity
;
and this
is
the proximate
cause
of
offensive
wars
.
Any nation
which
has
,
by
its
position
,
only the alternative
between commerce
and war
is
weak
in
itself
;
it
is
dependent on
its
neighbours
and
on
events
;
it
has only
a
short
and precarious
existence
.
It
conquers
and
changes
its
situation
,
or
it
is
con-
quered and reduced
to
nothing
.
It
can preserve
its
freedom only
by virtue
of
being
small
or
great
.
38
It
is
impossible
to
express numerically
a
fixed ratio between
the extent of land and the number of men which are reciprocally
sufficient
,
on account
of
the differences
that
are found
in
the
quality
of
the
soil
,
in
its
degrees
of
fertility
,
in
the nature
of
its
products
,
and
in
the
influence
of
climate
,
as
well
as
on
account
of those which we observe
in
the constitutions
of
the inhabitants
,
of whom some
consume
little
in
a
fertile
country
,
while
others
consume much on an unfruitful soil.
Further
,
attention
must
be
paid
to
the greater
or
less fecundity
of
the
women
,
to
the
con-
ditions
of
the country
,
whether
more
or
less favourable
to
popu-
lation
, and to the numbers which the legislator
may hope to draw
thither
by his
institutions
;
so that
an opinion should
be based
not
on what
is
seen
,
but on what
is
foreseen
,
while
the
actual
state
of the
people
should be less
observed
than that which it
142


The People.
143
ought naturally to
attain .
In
short , there
are
a thousand
oc-
casions on which
the particular
accidents
of situation
require
or
permit that
more
territory
than
appears
necessary
should
be
taken up.
Thus
men will
spread
out
a good deal
in a
moun-
tainous
country , where
the natural
productions
, viz . woods
and
pastures ,
require
less
labour,
where
experience
teaches
that
women
are
more
fecund
than
in the plains , and
where with
an
extensive
inclined
surface
there is only a small
horizontal
base,
which alone should
count
for vegetation .
On the other
hand ,
people
may inhabit a smaller space on the sea -shore , even among
rocks and
sands that
are almost
barren , because
fishing
can , in
great
measure , supply the
deficiency
in the
productions
of the
earth , because
men ought
to be
more
concentrated
in order to
repel
pirates , and because , further , it is easier to relieve the coun-
try, by means of
colonies , of the inhabitants
with which it is
overburdened
.
In
order
to establish
a
nation , it is necessary to add to these
conditions one which
cannot
supply the place of any other , but
without
which they are all useless-it is that the people
should
enjoy abundance
and peace ; for the time
of a State's formation
is , like
that
of forming
soldiers in
a square , the
time
when the
body is
least
capable
of resistance
and most
easy
to
destroy .
Resistance
would be greater in a state of absolute
disorder
than
at a moment
of fermentation , when each is occupied
with his own
position
and
not with the
common
danger .
Should
a
war , a
famine , or a sedition
supervene at
this
critical
period , the
State
is inevitably overthrown .
Many governments , indeed ,
may
be
established
during
such
storms , but then it is
these
very
governments
that
destroy
the
Patriot
State
.
Usurpers
always bring
about
or
select troublous
times for
passing
,
under
cover
of
the public
agitation
,
destructive
laws
which the people would never adopt
when
sober
-
minded
.
The
choice
of
the moment
for the establishment
of
a
government
is
one of the surest marks for
distinguishing
the work
of
the legis-
lator from that of the tyrant
.
What nation
,
then
,
is
adapted
for legislation
?
That which
is
already united by some bond
of
interest
,
origin
,
or
convention
,
but has not yet borne the real yoke
of
the laws
;
that which has
neither customs nor
superstitions
firmly rooted
;
that
which has
no fear
of
being
overwhelmed
by
a
sudden
invasion
,
but which
,
without entering
into the
disputes
of
its
neighbours
,
can
single-
handed resist
either
of
them
,
or
aid
one
in
repelling
the other
;
that
in
which every member
can be known by all
,
and
in
which
act

there
is no necessity to lay on a
man
a greater
burden
than a
man can bear ; that which can subsist without
other nations , and
without which every other
nation
can
subsist ; * that
which is
neither rich nor poor and is self -sufficing ; lastly , that which com-
bines
the stability
of an old
nation
with the
docility of a new
one .
The work of legislation
is rendered
arduous
not
so much
by what must be established
as by what
must
be destroyed
; and
that which makes success
so rare is the
impossibility of finding
the simplicity
of nature
conjoined
with the necessities of society .
All these
conditions
, it
is
true ,
are with difficulty
combined
;
hence few well -constituted
States are seen .
There is still one
country
in Europe capable
of legislation
;
it is the island of
Corsica .40
The
courage
and
firmness
which
that
brave nation
has
exhibited
in recovering
and
defending
its
freedom
would well
deserve that
some
wise
man
should
teach
it how to
preserve
it.
I
have
some
presentiment
that
this
small island will one day astonish
Europe.
* If of two neighbouring
nations one could not subsist without
the
other, it would
be a very hard
situation for the first, and a very dan-
gerous one for the second .
Every wise nation in such a case will
endeavour very quickly
to free the other from this
dependence .
The
republic of Thlascala , enclosed in the empire of Mexico , preferred to
do without salt rather than buy it of the Mexicans or even accept it
gratuitously .
The
wise Thlascalans
saw a trap hidden
beneath this
generosity .
They kept themselves
free ; and this
small
State , en-
closed in that great empire , was at last the instrument of its downfall .


CHAPTER
XI .
THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF LEGISLATION .
If we
ask
precisely
wherein
consists
the
greatest
good of
all
,
which ought
to
be the aim
of
every system
of
legislation
,
we shall
find
that
it
is
summed
up
in
two principal
objects
,
liberty
and
equality
,
―liberty
,
because any individual dependence
is
so
much
force withdrawn
from the body
of
the State
;
equality
,
because
liberty cannot subsist without
it
.
I
have
already
said
what
civil
liberty
is
.
With
regard
to
equality
,
41
we must not understand
by this
word
that the degrees
of power and wealth
should
be
absolutely
the same
;
but that
,
as
to
power
,
it
should
fall short of all violence
,
and
never
be
ex-
ercised
except
by
virtue
of
station
and
of
the laws
;
while
,
as
to
wealth
,
no
citizen
should
be rich enough
to
be
able
to
buy
another
,
and none
poor enough
to
be forced
to
sell
himself
,*
which supposes
,
on the part
of
the great
,
moderation
in
property
and influence
,
and
,
on the part
of
ordinary
citizens
,
repression
of
avarice
and covetousness
.
It
is
said
that this equality
is
a
chimera
of
speculation
which
cannot
exist
in
practical
affairs
.
But
if
the abuse
is
inevitable
,
does
it
follow that
it
is
unnecessary
even
to
regulate
it
?
It
is
precisely
because
the force
of
circumstances
is
ever
tending
to
destroy
equality
that the force
of
legislation
should
always tend
to maintain
it
.
43
But these general
objects
of
every good
institution ought
to
be modified
in
each country by the relations
which arise both
from the local situation
and from the character
of the inhabitants
;
and
it
is
with reference
to these relations
that we must assign to
*
If
,
then
,
you wish
to
give stability
to
the State
,
bring
the two ex-
tremes
as
near together
as
possible
;
tolerate neither rich
people nor
beggars
.
These
two
conditions
,
naturally
inseparable
,
are equally
fatal
to
the general welfare
;
from the one class spring tyrants
,
from
the other
,
the supporters
of
tyranny
;
it
is
always between these that
the traffic
in
public liberty
is
carried on
;
the
one
buys and the other
sells.442

The Social Contract .
each nation
a particular
system of institutions
, which shall be the
best , not perhaps in itself, but for the State for which it is designed .
For instance , if the
soil
is unfruitful and
barren , or the country
too confined
for its inhabitants
, turn your
attention
to
arts and
manufactures , and exchange their products
for the provisions
that
you require .
On the other hand , if you
occupy
rich plains
and
fertile slopes , if, in a productive
region , you are in need of inhabit-
ants , bestow
all your cares on agriculture , which multiplies
men ,
and drive out the arts, which would only end in depopulating
the
country by gathering
together in a few spots the few inhabitants
that the land possesses ."* If you occupy
extensive and convenient
coasts ,
cover the
sea
with
vessels and
foster
commerce
and
navigation
; you will have a short and brilliant
existence . If the
sea on your coasts bathes only rocks
that are almost inaccessible
,
remain
fish -eating barbarians
; you will
lead
more
peaceful , per-
haps better , and certainly
happier
lives .
In a word , besides the
maxims
common
to
all, each nation
contains
within itself some
cause
which
influences
it in a
particular
way , and
renders
its
legislation
suitable
for it alone .
Thus the Hebrews in ancient
times , and the Arabs
more
recently , had religion
as their
chief
object , the Athenians
literature , Carthage
and Tyre commerce
,
Rhodes navigation , Sparta
war , Rome
valour .
The author of
the Spirit ofthe Laws has shown
in a multitude
of instances
by
what arts the legislator
directs his institutions
towards each of these
objects.45
What renders the constitution
of a State really solid
and durable
is the observance
of expediency
in such
a way that
natural
re-
lations
and the
laws
always
coincide , the latter
only serving , as
it were , to secure , support ,
and
rectify
the former .
But if the
legislator , mistaken
in his object , takes
a principle
different
from
that which
springs
from the nature
of things
; if the one
tends
to servitude , the
other
to liberty,
the
one to riches , the
other to
population
, the
one to peace , the other to conquests , we shall
see
the laws
imperceptibly
weakened
and the constitution
impaired ;
and the State will be ceaselessly agitated until it is destroyed
or
changed , and invincible nature has resumed
her sway .
* Any branch of foreign commerce, says
the Marquis
d'Argenson ,
diffuses merely a deceptive utility
through
the kingdom
generally
; it
may enrich
a few individuals , even
a few towns , but the nation
as a
whole gains nothing , and the people are none the better for it.*

CHAPTER XII .
DIVISION OF THE LAWS.46
In order that
everything
may be duly
regulated
and
the best
possible
form
given
to
the commonwealth
, there
are
various
relations
to
be considered .
First , the
action
of the whole body
acting on itself, that is, the relation
of the whole
to the whole , or
of the sovereign to the
State ; and this
relation
is composed of
that of the intermediate
terms , as we shall
see hereafter .
The laws
governing
this
relation
bear the name
of political
laws , and are
also
called
fundamental
laws , not without
some
reason if they are wise ones ; for, if in every State
there
is
only
one good method of regulating
it, the people which has discovered
it ought to adhere to it ; but if the established
order
is bad , why
should we regard
as fundamental
laws which
prevent it from being
good ?
Besides , in any
case, a nation
is
always
at liberty to
change
its laws , even the best ; for if it likes to injure itself, who
has a right to prevent it from doing so ?
The
second
relation
is that of the members with one another ,
or with the body as a whole
; and
this relation
should, in respect
of the first , be as small , and , in respect of the second , as great as
possible; so that every
citizen
may
be
perfectly
independent
of
all the
rest, and in
absolute
dependence
on the
State .47
And
this is always effected by the same means ; for it is only the power
of the State
that
secures
the
freedom
of its members .
It is
from this second
relation
that civil laws arise .
We
may consider a third kind of relation
between
the indi-
vidual
man and the law, viz. that of punishable
disobedience
;
and this gives rise to the establishment
of criminal
nal laws , which at
bottom
are not so much
a particular
species of laws as the sanc-
tion of all the others .
488To these three kinds of laws is added
a fourth , the most im-
portant of all, which is graven neither
on marble nor on brass , but
in the hearts of the
citizens
; a law which creates the real con-
stitution
of the State , which acquires
new strength
daily , which ,
when other
laws grow
obsolete
or pass
away , revives them or
147

The Social Contract .
supplies
their
place ,
preserves
a
people in the
spirit of their
institutions
, and imperceptibly
substitutes
the
force of habit for
that of authority .
I speak
of manners , customs , and
above
all
of opinion—a province unknown
to
our
politicians
, but one on
which the su
success of all the rest depends
; a province
with which
the great
legislator
is occupied
in
private ,
while
he appears
to
confine
himself to
particular
regulations , that
are
merely the
arching of the vault , of which manners , slower to develop , form at
length the immovable
keystone .
Of these
different
classes, political
laws , which constitute
the
form of government , alone relate to my subject .
Introduction .

Another
important
recognition
of the theory
was the
declaration
of the
Convention
Parliament in
1688 that James II.,
" having
en-
deavoured to
subvert
the constitution
by breaking
the original
contract
between
king
and
people ,"
had
rendered
the throne
vacant .
Before tracing
the doctrine
of the social
contract
in its
second
form , we must refer to the work of the first
comprehensive
politi-
cal philosopher of modern
times , Bodin , author
of the
Republic
( 1577
and
1586).
According to Bodin , force , and not a contract ,
is the origin of commonwealths
.
Primitive
patriarchal
govern-
Rolep
ments were overthrown
by conquest , and natural
liberty was thus
lost either wholly or in part .
Sovereignty
is supreme
power
over
citizens , and is itself bound
by no laws except
the law of
nature .
Whoever legislates is sovereign , for legislative
power includes
every
other.
In
every
independent
community
there
must
be some
power residing in one or more persons which
is the source of law,
and which must therefore
be superior
to the
positive
law that it
creates and enforces
; " this power somewhere
is necessary to
an
independent
State ,
and
its
presence
is the
test of national
in-
dependence ."
Since
"the legal
supremacy of the State is con-
ceivable only when the State has acquired
a local habitation
and a
permanent
establishment ," this view of sovereignty could not well
assume
definite
shape till the sixteenth
century . †
Bodin , then ,
seized on the central
position
in the modern
theory
of the
State ,
political sovereignty
; and he regarded
sovereignty
as independent
,
indivisible,
perpetual , inalienable
, absolute
power .
He tended ,
however , to confuse his theoretical
sovereignty
with existing
king-
ships , and held monarchy
to be the best form of government , no
such form
as a limited monarchy
being
possible
for the reason
that
sovereignty
is indivisible.
Bodin
defined
magistrates
as Sa Hobbes
officers of the sovereign
possessing public authority .

The great work of Grotius , De Jure Belli et Pacis (1625 ),
con
tains
observations
on several
questions
connected
with
political
theory .
Grotius
admits
a natural
right prior to any convention
and
holds
that
man
has
a
strong
desire
for a peaceable
and
ordered
society .
He appears , as Mr.
Ritchie remarks ,* to com
bine both forms of the social contract
theory . "Since it is con

had joined
any community , or put themselves
in subjection to
any
man
or men ,
had
either
expressly
promised , or from the
nature of the case must
have been understood
to promise tacitly,
that they would conform to that
which
either
the majority of the
community or those
to whom the
power
was
assigned
should
determine ."
The
sovereign
is that indivisible
power whose
act
cannot
be invalidated
by any human
authority , except
the
suc
ceeding
sovereign .
Grotius
inculcates
the
doctrine
of
non
resistance , and denies that the people
are always and everywhere
sovereign , or that all government
is established
for the sake
of
the governed .
Sovereignty
arises
either
from
conquest
or from
consent .
A whole
conquered
people
may , like individual
pri
soners , be reduced
to slavery , and
lose
their liberty de jure
and
de facto , though a moderate victor will
incorporate
them with
his
own citizens on equal
terms , or leave them such
degree of inde-
pendence
as is consistent with his own security .
Slavery , whether
of individuals
or
of nations , may
also
arise from
consent , and
their posterity
may become
the property
of a master or monarch ,
freedom being alienated in exchange for subsistence .
M. Janet †
observes that Grotius in some sense reduces sovereignty
to a con-
tract
of sale, treating
questions
of natural
or political right by
the maxims of civil law.

is the right of

t
a master over a slave (which
positive
law recognised ), transferred
to a people or monarch
over a conquered
nation .
The social contract
in
its
second
form
is
probably first found
in Hooker's
Ecclesiastical
Polity
,
Book
I.
(
1592-3
).*
Following
Thomas Aquinas
,
to
whom
he was greatly
indebted
,
Hooker pos-
tulates an original
state
of
nature
in
which all men were
equal
and subject
to
no law but the absolute
and eternally
binding law
of nature
,
revealed
by human
reason
.
Desire
for
a
life suitable
▾
to man's dignity
,
and aversion
to
solitude
,
impelled
them
to
unite
in
"
politic
societies
."
The natural
law still binds men
as
men
,
but
is
supplemented
by the
"
law politic
,"
which
binds them
as
members
of society
.
"
Two
foundations
there
are which bear
up public
societies
:
the
one
,
a
natural inclination
,
the
other
,
an
order
expressly
or
secretly
agreed
upon touching the
manner
of
their union
in
living together
.
The latter
is
that which
(6
we call the law of
a
commonweal
."
To
take
away all
mutual fue at
grievances
,
injuries
,
and wrongs
,
the only way was
to
ordain some
kind of government
,
or
common
judge
,
in
order that the author-
ity appointed
to
govern might
secure the peace and happiness
of
its subjects
.
While
admitting
with Aristotle that
the origin
of
government
was
in
kingship
,
Hooker
considers
that the incon-
veniences of this form
caused
others
to
be
devised
,
so that in
a
word all public regiment
of
what kind soever seemeth evidently
to
have risen
from
deliberate
advice
,
consultation
,
and
composi-
tion between men
,
judging
it
convenient
and
behoveful
."
Laws
not only teach what
is
good
,
but also
have
a
constraining
force
,
derived
from the consent
of
the governed
,
expressed
either
per-
sonally
or
through
representatives
.
"
Laws human
,
of what kind
soever
,
are available
[
ie
.
valid
]
by
consent
."
"
Laws they are
not which public approbation
hath not
made
so
."
Thus Hooker
clearly recognised
that political society
originated
in
a
compact
,
though probably
he was unaware
of
any advance upon Aristotle
and Thomas Aquinas
in
his description of
it
.
He also
affirmed
explicitly that sovereignty
,
or
legislative
power
,
resides ultimately
in
the people
.

BOOK III.
BEFORE speaking
of the different
forms
of government
, let
us
try to fix the
precise
meaning
of that
word, which
has not yet
been very clearly
explained .
CHAPTER
I.
GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL .
I WARN the reader that this chapter must
be
read
carefully , and
that I do not know the art of making myself intelligible to those
that will not be attentive .
Every free
action has two causes
concurring to
produce
it ;
the one moral , viz. the will which determines
the
act ; the
other
physical , viz. the power which executes it .
When I walk
towards
an object , I must first will to go to it ; in the second
place , my
feet
must carry me to it.
Should
a paralytic
wish to run , or an
active man not wish
to
do
so , both will
remain
where they
are .
The body politic has the same
motive
powers ; in it, likewise ,
force
and will
are distinguished
, the
latter
under
the
name
of
legislative
power , the former under
the name of executive
power .
Nothing is, or ought to be, done in it without
their co -operation .
We have
seen that the legislative
power belongs
to the people .
and
can
belong
to it alone .
On the other hand , it is
easy to
see from the principles
already
established ,
that
the
executive
power
cannot
belong
to the
people
generally
as legislative
or
sovereign , because
that
power
is exerted only in particular
acts,
which are not within the province
of the law, nor consequently
within that ofthe sovereign , all the acts of which must be laws .
The public force , then , requires
a suitable
agent
to concentrate
it and put it in action
according
to the directions
of the general
will , to serve
as a means
of communication
between
the
State
and the sovereign , to effect in some
manner in the public person
what the union of soul and body effects in a man .
This
is, in
the State , the function of the government , improperly
confounded
with the sovereign
of which it is only the minister.1
149


150
The Social Contract,
What, then, is
the
government
?
An intermediate
body
es-
tablished
between the subjects
and the
sovereign for their mutual
correspondence
, charged
with the
execution of the laws and with
the maintenance
of liberty
both civil and political.
The members of this body are called
magistrates
or kings , that
is, governors ; and the body as a whole bears the name of Prince .* 2
Those therefore
who maintain
that the
act by which
a people
submits
to its chiefs
is not
a
contract
are
quite
right.
It is
absolutely
nothing
but a commission , an employment , in which,
as simple
officers of the sovereign , they
exercise
in its name the
power of which it has made them
depositaries , and which it
can
limit, modify, and
resume
when
it
pleases .
The alienation of
such a right, being incompatible
with the nature of the social body ,
is contrary
to the object of the association .
Consequently
, I give the name government or supreme adminis-
tration
to the legitimate
exercise of the executive
power , and that
of Prince or magistrate
to the
man or body charged
with that
administration
.
It is in the government
that are found the intermediate . powers,
the relations of which constitute
the relation
of the whole to the
whole , or of the sovereign to the State .
This last relation can be
represented
by that of the extremes of a continued
proportion , of
which the
mean
proportional is the government .
The govern-
ment receives
from the sovereign the commands which it gives to
the people ; and in order that
the
State may be in stable
equili-
brium , it is necessary , everything
being balanced , that there should
be equality
between
the product or the power of the government
taken by itself , and the product
or the power of the citizens , who
are sovereign
in the one aspect and subjects in the other .
Further , we could not
alter any of the three terms without at
once
destroying
the proportion .
If the
sovereign
wishes to
govern, or if the magistrate
wishes
to legislate , or if the subjects
refuse
to obey , disorder
succeeds
order , force and will no longer
act in concert , and
the State
being
dissolved
falls into despotism
or anarchy .
Lastly,
as there is
but
one
mean
proportional be-
tween each
relation , there is only one good government
possible
in a State ; but as a thousand
events may change the relations
of
a people , not only may different
governments
be good for differ-
ent peoples , but for the same people
at different times.4
To try and give an
idea
of the different
relations
that may
* It is for this reason that at Venice the title of Most Serene Prince
isgivento the College , even when the Doge does not attend it.

Government in General .
151
C
?
exist between these two
extremes , I will take for an example the
number of the people , as a relation
most easy to express .
Let us
suppose
that the
State
is composed
of ten thousand
citizens .
The sovereign
can only be considered
collectively
and
as a body ; but every private
person , in his capacity of subject , is
considered
as
an
individual ; therefore
the
sovereign
is
to the
subject as ten
thousand
is to one , that
is , each
member
of the
State has as his share only one ten-thousandth
part of the sover-
eign authority , although
he is entirely
subjected
to it .
If the nation consists
of a hundred
thousand
men , the position
of the subjects
does
not change , and
each
alike is
subjected
to
the whole
authority
of the laws , whilst
his vote , reduced
to
one
hundred-thousandth
, has
ten times
less
influence
in their
enact-
ment .
The subject, then , always
remaining
a unit, the propor-
tional power of the sovereign
increases in the ratio of the number
of the
citizens .
Whence it
follows
that the more
the
State is
enlarged , the more does liberty diminish.
When I say that
the proportional
power increases , I mean that
it is farther
removed
from equality .
Therefore
, the
greater the
ratio is in the geometrical
sense, the less is the ratio
in the com-
mon acceptation
; in the
former , the
ratio , considered
according
to
quantity , is
measured
by the
exponent , and in the
other ,
considered
according
to identity , it is estimated
by the similarity .
Now , the less the particular
wills correspond
with the
general
will, that is , customs
with laws , the
more
should
the
repressive
power be
increased .
The government ,
then ,
in
order
to be
effective , should
be relatively
stronger in proportion
as the people
are more numerous .
On the other hand , as the
aggrandisement
of the
State
gives
the depositaries
of the public authority
more
temptations
and
more opportunities
to abuse their
power , the
more
force
should
the government
have to restrain
the people , and
the more should
the sovereign
have in
its
turn
to
restrain
the government
.
I
do
not speak
here of absolute
force
,
but of the relative
force of the
different
parts
of
the State
.
It
follows
from this double
ratio that the continued
proportion
between
the
sovereign
,
the
Prince
,
and the
people
is
not an
arbitrary
idea
,
but
a
necessary
consequence
of
the nature
of
the
body politic
.
It
follows
,
further
,
that
one
of
the extremes
,
viz
.
the
people
,
as
subject
,
being
fixed
and
represented
by unity
,
whenever
the double
ratio increases
or
diminishes
,
the single ratio
increases
or
diminishes
in
like
manner
,
and
consequently
the
middle term
is
changed
.
This shows that there
is
no unique
and


152
The Social Contract .
absolute
constitution
of government , but that there
may be as
many governments
different in nature as there are States different
in size.
If, for the sake of turning
this
system to ridicule, it should
be
said that , in order to find this mean
proportional and
form
the´
body of the government , it is, according
to me, only necessary to
take the square root of the number
of the people , I should
answer
that I take that number
here only as an example
; that
the ratios
of which I speak are not measured
only by the number of men ,
but in general
by the
quantity
of action , which results
from the
combination
of multitudes
of causes ; that , moreover , if for the
purpose
of expressing
myself in
fewer
words , I
borrow for a
moment
geometrical
terms , I
am
nevertheless
aware that geo-
metrical
precision
has no place in moral
quantities .
The
government
is on
a small
scale
what
the
body politic
which includes
it is on a large
scale .
It is a moral
person
en-
dowed with certain
faculties , active like the sovereign , passive like
the State , and it can be resolved into other similar
relations ; from
which
arises as a consequence
a new proportion
, and
yet another
within
this , according
to the order
of the
magistracies , until
we
come to an indivisible middle term , that is , to
a single chief or
supreme
magistrate , who
may
be
represented , in the middle of
this progression , as unity between
the series of fractions
and that
of the whole numbers .
Without
embarrassing
ourselves
with this
multiplication
of
terms , let
us
be
content
to consider
the
government
as
a new
body in the State , distinct
from
the
people and
from the sover-
eign , and intermediate
between the two .
There is this essential difference
between those two bodies , that
the State exists by itself, while the government
exists only through
the sovereign .
Thus the dominant
will of the Prince is , or ought
to be, only the general will , or the law ; its force is only the public
force
concentrated
in itself ; so soon as it wishes
to
perform
of
itself some absolute
and
independent
act, the
connexion
of the
whole
begins to be relaxed .
If, lastly , the Prince should
chance
to have a particular
will more
active
than that of the
sovereign ,
and if, to enforce
obedience
to this
particular
will , it should
em-
ploy the public force which is in its hands , in such a manner that
there would
be so to speak
two
sovereigns , the one
de jure and
the other de facto , the social union would immediately
disappear ,
and the body politic would
be dissolved .
Further, in order that the body of the government
may have an
existence , a real life , to distinguish
it from the body of the State ;


Government in General .
153
in order that all its
members
may be
able to act in concert
and
fulfil the object for which it is instituted , a particular
personality
is necessary
to
it, a
feeling
common to its
members , a force, a
will of its own tending
to its
preservation .
This individual exist-
ence supposes
assemblies , councils , a
power
of deliberating
and
resolving , rights , titles , and
privileges
which belong to the Prince
exclusively
, and which render the position of the magistrate
more
honourable in
proportion
as it is more
arduous .
The difficulty
lies in the method of disposing , within the whole , this subordinate
whole, in such a way that it may not weaken
the general
constitu-
tion in strengthening
its own ; that
its
particular
force , intended
for its own preservation , may
always
be
kept
distinct from the
public force , designed for the preservation
of the State ; and , in a
word, that it may always be ready to
sacrifice
the
government
to
the people , and not the people
to the government .
Moreover, although
the artificial
body of the government
is the
work of another artificial body, and
has in some respects only a
derivative
and subordinate
existence , that does
not
prevent
it
from acting with more or less vigour
or celerity , from enjoying , so
to
speak , more
or less
robust
health .
Lastly, without directly
departing
from
the
object
for which it
was
instituted
, it
may
deviate
from it more or less, according
to the manner in which it
is constituted
.
From all these differences
arise the
different
relations
which
the government
must
have with the body of the
State , so
as to
accord with the
accidental
and
particular
relations
by which the
State itself is modified .
For often the government
that is best in
itself will become the most vicious , unless its relations
are changed
so as to meet the defects
of the body politic to which it belongs .

1
CHAPTER II.
THE PRINCIPLE WHICH CONSTITUTES THE
DIFFERENT
FORMS
OF GOVERNMENT .
To
explain
the general
cause
of these
differences , I must here
distinguish
the Prince from the government , as I before
distin-
guished
the State from the sovereign .
The body of the magistracy
may be composed
of a greater or
less number of members .
We said that the ratio of the sovereign
to the subjects
was
so
much
greater
as the
people
were more
numerous
; and, by an evident
analogy , we can
say the
same of
the government
with regard to the magistrates .
Now , the total force of the government , being always that of the
State , does not vary ; whence it follows that the more it employs
this
force
on its
own
members , the less
remains
for operating
upon the whole
people .
Consequently
, the
more
numerous
the
magistrates
are, the
weaker is the government .
As
this maxim is fundamental
, let us
endeavour
to explain it more clearly .
We can distinguish
in the person of the magistrate
three wills
essentially
different
:
first , the
will
peculiar
to the
individual ,
which tends
only to
his
personal
advantage
; secondly , the com-
mon will
of the magistrates , which has
reference
solely to the
advantage of the Prince , and which may be called
the
corporate
will, being general in relation
to the
government , and
particular
in relation
to the State of which the
government
forms part ; in
the third place , the will of the people , or the sovereign will , which
is general
both in relation
to the
State
considered
as the whole ,
and
in
relation
to the
government
considered
as
part
of the
whole.)
In a perfect
system
of legislation
the
particular
or individual
will
should
be
inoperative
; the
corporate
will
proper
to the
government
quite
subordinate
; and
consequently
the
general
or
sovereign will always dominant , and the sole rule of all the rest
On
the
other
hand ,
according
to the
natural
order , these
different wills become
more active in proportion as they are con-
154

Forms of Government .
155
centrated .
Thus the
general
will
is
always
the
weakest , the
corporate
will
has the second
rank , and the
particular
will the
first of all ; so
that in the
government
each
member
is, firstly ,
himself,
next
a
magistrate ,
and
then
a
citizen-a
gradation
directly opposed
to that which
the social order
requires .
But suppose
that the whole
government
is in the
hands of a
single man , then the
particular
will
and the
corporate
will are
perfectly united , and
consequently
the
latter
is in the
highest
possible degree of intensity .
Now, as it is on the degree of will
that the exertion of force depends , and
as the absolute
power of
the government
does
not vary , it follows
that the most
active
government
is that of a single person .
On the other hand , let us unite
the government
with the legis-
lative authority
; let us
make
the sovereign
the Prince, and
all
the
citizens
magistrates
; then the
corporate
will ,
confounded
with the general
will , will
have no more
activity
than the
latter ,
and will leave the particular will in all
its
force
.
Thus the govern-
ment
,
always with the same absolute
force
,
will be
at
its minimum
of relative
force
or
activity
.
These
relations
are
incontestable
,
and
other
considerations
serve
still further to confirm
them
.
We
see
,
for example
,
that
each
magistrate
is
more
active
in
his body than
each
citizen
is
in
his
,
and that consequently
the
particular
will
has much
more
influence
in
the acts
of
government
than
in
those
of
the sovereign
;
for every magistrate
is
almost
always charged
with some function
of government
,
whereas
each
citizen
,
taken
by himself
,
has no
function of sovereignty
.
Besides
,
the
more
a
State
extends
,
the more
is
its real force
increased
,
although
it
does not increase
in
proportion
to
its
extent
;
but
,
while the
State
remains
the
same
,
it
is
useless
to
multiply
magistrates
,
for the government
acquires
no greater
real
force
,
inasmuch
as
this
force
is
that of
the State
,
the
quantity
of
which
is
always
uniform
.
Thus the
relative
force
or
activity
of
the
government
diminishes
without
its absolute or real force being able
to
increase
.
It
is
certain
,
moreover
,
that
the
despatch
of
business
is
retarded
in
proportion
as
more
people
are charged
with
it;
that
,
in
laying too
much
stress
on
prudence
,
we
leave
too little to
fortune
;
that
opportunities
are
allowed
to
pass
by
,
and that
owing to
excessive
deliberation
the
fruits
of
deliberation
are
often lost
.
I
have
just
shown
that
the
government
is
weakened
in
proportion
to
the multiplication
of
magistrates
,
and
I
have before
demonstrated
that the more
numerous
the people
is,
the
more

ought
the
repressive
force
to
be increased .
Whence it follows
that the ratio between the magistrates
and the government
ought
to
be
inversely
as
the
ratio
between
the
subjects
and
the
sovereign ;
that is, the
more
the
State
is
enlarged , the
more
should
the
government
contract
; so that the number of chiefs
should
diminish in proportion
as the number
of the people is
increased .
But I speak here only of the relative force of the government
,
and not of
its
rectitude
;
for,
on the
other
hand , the
more
numerous
the
magistracy
is , the
more
does
the
corporate
will
approach
the
general
will ; whereas , under a single
magistrate ,
this
same
corporate
will
is ,
as I
have
said ,
only
a
particular
will .
Thus , what is lost on one side can be gained
on the other ,
and the art
of
the
legislator
consists
in knowing how to
fix
the point where
the
force
and will of the government , always
in
reciprocal
proportion
,
are
combined
in
the
ratio
most
advantageous
to the State ."

CHAPTER III.
CLASSIFICATION
OF GOVERNMENTS,'
We
have
seen in the
previous
chapter
why the different
kinds
or forms of government
are
distinguished
by the
number
of
members
that
compose
them ;
it
remains
to
be seen
in
the
present
chapter how this division
is made .
The
sovereign
may, in the
first
place ,
commit
the
charge
of the government
to the whole
people , or to the greater
part
of the
people , in such
a way
that
there
may
be
more
citizens
who are magistrates
than simple
individual
citizens .
We
call
this form of government
a democracy
.
Or it may
confine the government
to a small
number , so that
there
may be more
ordinary
citizens
than magistrates
;
and this
form
bears the name of aristocracy .
Lastly , it may concentrate
the whole
government
in the
hands
of a single magistrate
from whom all the rest derive their power .
This third form
is the most
common , and is called
monarchy , or
royal government .
We should
remark
that all these
forms , or
at least the first
two ,
admit
of
degrees ,
and
may
indeed
have
a considerable
range ; for
democracy
may
embrace
the whole
people , or be
limited to
a half.
Aristocracy, in its
turn ,
may
restrict
itself
from
a half of the people to the smallest number
indeterminately
.
Royalty
even
is
susceptible
of some
division .
Sparta
by
its
constitution
always
had
two
kings ; and in the
Roman Empire
there
were as many as eight
Emperors
at once
without
its being
possible
to
say
that the Empire
was divided.
Thus there
is a
point at which each form of government
blends
with
the
next ;
and we see that , under
three denominations
only , the government
is really susceptible
of as many
different
forms as the State
has
citizens .
What is more , this same government
being in certain
respects
capable of subdivision
into other
parts , one
administered
in one
way, another
in
another , there
may
result
from
combinations
157


158
The Social Contract .
of these three forms
a multitude
of mixed
forms , each of which
can be multiplied by all the simple forms .
In all ages there
has
been
much
discussion
about
the
best
form of government
, without consideration
of the fact that each
of them is the best in certain
cases, and the worst in others .
If, in
the
different
States ,
the
number
of
the
supreme
magistrates
should
be in
inverse
ratio to
that of the
citizens , it
follows
that, in general ,
democratic
government
is
suitable
to
small States , aristocracy
to those of moderate
size, and monarchy
to large ones .
This rule follows immediately from the principle .
But how is it possible
to estimate the multitude
of circumstances
which may furnish
exceptions
?


.
CHAPTER
IV .
DEMOCRACY.8
HE that makes the law knows
better than any one how it should
be
executed
and
interpreted
.
It would seem , then , that there
could
be no better
constitution
than one in which the executive
power is united
with the
legislative
; but it is that
very
circum-
stance
which
makes
a
democratic
government
inadequate
in
certain
respects , because things
which ought to be distinguished
are
not , and
because the Prince
and the
sovereign ,
being
the
same person , only form as it were a government
without govern-
ment.
It is not expedient
that he who
makes the laws should execute
them , nor that the body of the people
should
divert
its attention
from
general
considerations
in order
to bestow it on particular
objects.
Nothing
is
more
dangerous
than the
influence of
private interests
on public
affairs ;
and the abuse
of the
laws
by the
government
is
a less
evil
than
the
corruption
of the
legislator , which
is the infallible
result of the
pursuit
of private
interests .
For when the
State is changed
in its substance
all
reform becomes
impossible
.
A people which would
never abuse
the
government
would
likewise
never
abuse
its
independence
;
a
people
which always
governed
well
would
not
need
to
be
governed
.
9
Taking the
term
in
its strict
sense
,
there
never
has
existed
,
and never will exist
,
any
t,
any true
democracy
.
It
is
contrary
to
the
natural
order
that
the
majority
should
govern
and that the
minority
should
be governed
.
It
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
the
people
should
remain
in
perpetual
assembly
to
attend
to
public affairs
,
and
it
is
easily
apparent
that
commissions
could
not be established
for that
purpose
without
the
form of adminis-
tration being changed
.
In fact
,I
think
I
can
lay down
as
a
principle
that
when
the
functions
of
government
are
shared
among
several magistracies
,
the least numerous
acquire
,
sooner
or
later
,
the greatest authority
,
159

160
The Social Contract .
if only on account
of the facility in transacting
business
which
naturally
leads them on to that .
Moreover, how many things
difficult to combine
does
not this
government
presuppose
!
First , a very
small
State , in
which
the
people
may
be
readily
assembled ,
and
in which
every
citizen
can
easily
know
all
the rest
;
secondly
,
great
simplicity
of
manners
,
which prevents
a
multiplicity
of
affairs
and thorny
discussions
;
next
,
considerable
equality
in
rank and
fortune
,
without which
equality
in
rights
and
authority
could not long
subsist
;
lastly
,
little
or
no luxury
,
for luxury
is
either the
effect
of wealth
or
renders
it
necessary
;
it
corrupts
both the rich and
the
poor
,
the former by possession
,
the latter by covetousness
;
it
betrays the country
to
effeminacy
and vanity
;
it
deprives
the
State
of
all its
citizens
in
order
to
subject
them one to another
,
and all to opinion.10
That
is
why
a
famous author has assigned virtue
as
the principle
of
a
republic
,
for all these
conditions
could
not subsist without
virtue
;
but
,
through
not making the necessary
distinctions
,
this
brilliant genius
has often
lacked
precision
and sometimes
clear-
ness
,
and has not seen that the sovereign
authority being every-
where the same
,
the same principle
ought
to
have
a
place
in
every
well
-
constituted
State
,
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
,
it
is
true
,
according
to
the form
of
government.11
Let
us
add that
there
is
no
government
so
subject
to
civil
wars and internal
agitations
as
the democratic
or
popular
,
because
there
is
none
which
tends
so
strongly
and
so
constantly to
change
its
form
,
none which demands more vigilance
and courage
to be
maintained
in
its own
form.12
It
is
especially
in
this
constitution
that the citizen
should
arm himself with strength
and
steadfastness
,
and say
every
day
of
his life from the bottom
of
his heart what
a
virtuous
Palatine
*
said
in
the Diet
of
Poland
:
Malo periculosam libertatem quam quietum servitium.13
If there
were
a
nation
of
gods
,
it
would
be
governed
democratically
.
So
perfect
a
government
is
unsuited
to
men

CHAPTER
V.
ARISTOCRACY
.
WE have
here
two moral persons quite distinct , viz. the
govern-
ment
and the
sovereign
; and
consequently
two
general wills ,
the one having
reference to all the citizens , the other
only to the
members ofthe administration
.
Thus , although
the government
can regulate its internal
policy as it pleases , it can never speak to
the people
except in the name
of the
sovereign , that is, in the
name of the people themselves .
This must never be forgotten .
The
earliest
societies
were
aristocratically
governed.14
The
heads
of families
deliberated
among
themselves
about
public
affairs .
The young men
yielded
readily
to
the
authority of
experience .
Hence the
names
priests ,
elders ,
senate , gerontes.15
The savages of North America are still governed
in this way at
the
present time , and are very well governed .
But in proportion as the inequality
due to institutions
prevailed
over natural
inequality , wealth
or power * was preferred
to
age ,
and aristocracy
became elective .
Finally , the power transmitted
with the father's property
to the
children , rendering
the
families
patrician,
made
the
government
hereditary ,
and
there
were
senators only twenty years old.
There are, then, three kinds of aristocracy - natural , elective ,
and
hereditary .
The
first is only suitable
for simple
nations
;
the third is the worst of all governments
.
The
second
is
the
best ; it is aristocracy
properly so-called .
Besides
the
advantage
of the
distinction
between
the
two
powers , aristocracy
has that of the choice of its members
; for in a
popular government
all
the
citizens
are
born
magistrates
;
but
this one limits
them
to
a
small number
,
and they become
magis-
trates
by election
only
;

of
magistrates

gence , experience , and all other grounds of preference
and public
esteem are
so
many
fresh
guarantees
that men will
be
wisely
governed .
Further,
assemblies
are
more
easily
convoked
;
affairs
are
better discussed
and
are
despatched
with
greater
order and dili-
gence ; while
the credit of the State
is better maintained
abroad
by venerable
senators , than
by an unknown
or despised
multi-
tude .

multitude , when

should
not uselessly multiply means , nor do with twenty
thousand
men what a hundred
chosen men can do still better .
But we must
observe that the corporate
interest begins here to direct the pub-
lic force in a less degree according
to the rule of the general will ,
and that another
inevitable
propensity
deprives
the laws of a part
of the executive power .
With regard to
special
expediencies ,
a
State
must not be so
small , nor a people
so simple and
upright , that the execution
of
the laws
should follow immediately
upon the public will , as in a
good democracy .
Nor again must a nation
be so large
that the
chief men , who are dispersed in order to govern
it, can set up as
sovereigns , each in his own
province , and begin by making them-
selves independent
so as at last to become
masters .
But if aristocracy
requires
a
few
virtues
less
than
popular
government
, it
requires
also
others
that are peculiarly
its
own
,
such
as
moderation
among the rich and contentment
among the
poor
;
for
a
rigorous
equality
would
seem
to
be
out
of
place
in
it,
and was not even observed
in
Sparta.17
Besides
,

.



CHAPTER VI.
MONARCHY
.
WE have hitherto
considered
the Prince as a moral
and collective
person united by the
force of the laws , and
as the depositary of
the executive power in the State .
We have now to consider
this
power concentrated
in the hands
of a natural
person , of a real
man, who alone has a right to
dispose of it according
to the laws .
He is what is called
a monarch
or a king.
Quite the reverse of the other forms of administration
, in which
a collective
being
represents
an individual, in this
one an indi-
vidual represents
a collective
being ; so that the moral
unity
that
constitutes
it is at the same time a physical
unity , in which all the
powers
that the law combines
in the other
with so much
effort
are combined
naturally .
Thus the will of the people , the will of the Prince, the public
force of the State , and the particular force of the government ,
all
obey the same motive
power
;
all the springs
of
the machine
are
in
the same hand
,
everything
works for the same end
;
there
are
no opposite
movements
that counteract
one another
,
and no kind
of constitution
can
be
imagined
in
which
a
more considerable
action
is
produced
with less effort
.
Archimedes
,
19
quietly seated
on the
shore
,
and launching
without
difficulty
a
large
vessel
,
represents
to
me
a
skilful
monarch
,
governing
from his cabinet
his
vast
States
,
and
,
while
he appears motionless
,
setting
everything
in motion
.
But
if
there
is
no
government
which has more vigour
,
there
is
none
in
which the particular
will has more
sway and more
easily
governs
others
.
Everything
works
for the same end
,
it
is
true
;
but this
end
is
not the public
welfare
,
and
the
very
power
of
the administration
turns continually
to
the prejudice
of
the State
.
Kings wish
to
be absolute
,
and from
afar men cry
to
them that
the best way to
become
so
is
to
make
themselves
beloved by
their
people
.
This
maxim
is
very
fine
,
and
also
very true
in
certain
respects
;
unfortunately
it
will
always
be
ridiculed
in
courts
.
Power which springs from the affections
of
the people
is
163


164
The Social Contract .
doubtless
the
greatest , but it is
precarious
and
conditional ;
princes
will
never be satisfied
with it.
The
best
kings
wish to
have the power of being
wicked
if they please , without
ceasing
to be masters .
A political preacher
will tell them in vain that,
the
strength
of the people
being
their
own , it is their
greatest
interest
that the
people
should
be
flourishing ,
numerous ,
and
formidable
; they know very
well that that
is not true .
Their
personal interest is, in the first
place , that
the
people
should be
weak
and
miserable , and
should
never
be able to resist them.
Supposing
all the
subjects
always
perfectly
submissive , I admit
that it would then be the prince's
interest that the people should
be powerful , in order that this power , being his own , might render
him formidable
to his neighbours
;
but
as this
interest
is only
secondary
and
subordinate , and as the two
suppositions
are in-
compatible
, it is natural
that princes should always give preference
to the maxim
which is
most
immediately
useful to them .
It is
this that Samuel 20 strongly
represented to the Hebrew ; it is this
that Machiavelli clearly
demonstrated .
While pretending
to give
lessons to kings , he gave great
ones
to
peoples .
The Prince of
Machiavelli is the book of republicans.21 *
We have found, by general
considerations
, that
monarchy is
suited
only to large States ;
and we
shall
find this
again
by
examining
monarchy
itself .
The
more
numerous
the
public
administrative
body is, the more
does the ratio of the Prince to
the subjects
diminish and
approach
equality , so that
this ratio
is unity or equality ,
even in a democracy .
This
same ratio in-
creases
in proportion
as the government
contracts , and is at
its
maximum
when the government
is
in
the hands
of
a
single
person
.
Then the distance between the Prince and the people
is
too great
,
and the State lacks
cohesion
.
In order
to
unify
it
,
then
,
inter-
mediate
orders
,
princes
,
grandees
,
and nobles
,
are required
to
fill
them
.
Now
,
nothing
at
all
of
this kind
is
proper for
a
small
State
,
which would
be
ruined
by
all
these orders
.
*
Machiavelli
was an honourable
man and
a
good
citizen
;
but
,
attached
to
the house
of
the Medici
,
he was forced
,
during the oppres-
sion
of
his country
,
to
conceal his love for liberty
.
The mere choice
of
his execrable hero sufficiently manifests his
secret
intention
;
and
the opposition between the maxims
of
his book the Prince and those
of
his Discourses
on
Titus Livius and his History
of
Florence
shows
that this profound politician
has had hitherto only superficial
or
cor-
rupt readers
.
The court of Rome has strictly prohibited his book
;I
certainly believe
it,
for
it
is
that court which he most clearly depicts
.


Monarchy .
165
But if it is difficult for a great State to be well governed , it is
much more so for it to be well governed
by a single
man
; and
every one knows
what happens
when the king appoints
deputies.22
One essential and inevitable
defect , which will
always render
a
monarchical government
inferior
to a republican
one , is that in the
tatter the public voice hardly ever raises to the highest
posts any
but enlightened
and
capable
men , who fill them
honourably ;
whereas
those
who succeed
in monarchies
are
most
frequently
only petty mischief-makers , petty
knaves , petty
intriguers , whose
petty talents , which enable
them
to attain
high
posts in courts ,
only serve to show the public their ineptitude
as soon
as they
have attained
them .
The people
are much
less
mistaken
about
their choice than the prince
is ; and a man of real merit is almost
as rare in a royal
ministry
as a fool at the
head of a republican
government
.23
Therefore, when by some fortunate
chance
one of
these born rulers
takes the helm of affairs in a monarchy
almost
wrecked by such
a fine
set of ministers , it is
quite
astonishing
what
resources
he
finds , and
his
accession
to
power
forms
an
epoch in a country.24
In order that
a monarchical
State might
be well
governed , it
would be
necessary
that its
greatness
or
extent
should
be
pro-
portioned to the abilities
of him that
governs .
It is easier to
conquer than to rule.
With a sufficient
lever , the world may be
moved by a finger
;
but to support
it the
shoulders
of Hercules
are required .
However
small
a
State
may
be, the
prince
is
almost always
too small for it.25
When, on the contrary , it hap-
pens that the State
is too small
for
its
chief
,
which
is
very rare
,
it
is
still badly governed
,
because the chief
,
always pursuing
his own
great designs
,
forgets the interests
of
the people
,
and renders them
no less unhappy
by the abuse
of
his
transcendent
abilities
,
than
an inferior chief by his lack
of
talent
.
It
would
be
necessary
,
so
to
speak
,
that
a
kingdom should be enlarged
or
contracted
in
every
reign
,
according
to
the capacity of the prince
;
whereas
,
the talents
of
a
senate
having
more
definite
limits
,
the
State
may
have
permanent
boundaries
,
and the administration
prosper
equally
well
.
The most obvious
inconvenience
of the government
of
a
single
person
is
the lack
of
that uninterrupted
succession
26
which forms
in
the two others
a
continuous
connexion
.
One king being
dead
,
another
is
necessary
;
elections
leave
dangerous
intervals
;
they
are stormy
;
and unless the citizens
are
of
a
disinterestedness
,
an
integrity
,
which
this
government
hardly admits
of
,
intrigue
and
corruption intermingle
with
it
.
It
would be
hard
for
a
man
to

166
The Social Contract .
whom the State has been
sold not to
sell it in his
turn , and
in-
demnify himself
out
of the helpless
for the money
which
the
powerful
have
extorted
from
him.
Sooner
or later everything
becomes
venal under such
an
administration
,
and the
peace
which is then enjoyed
under
a king is worse than
the disorder of
an interregnum
.
What
has been
done
to
prevent
these
evils ?
Crowns have
been made hereditary
in certain
families
; and an order of succes-
sion
has
been
established
which
prevents
any
dispute
on the
demise of kings
; that
is to
say, the
inconvenience
of regencies
being substituted
for
that
of
elections , an appearance
of tran-
quillity has been preferred
to a wise administration
, and men have
preferred
to risk
having
as their chiefs children , monsters , and
imbeciles ,
rather
than
have a dispute
about the choice of good
kings.
They
have not considered
that
in thus exposing
them-
selves to the risk of this
alternative , they
put
almost
all the
chances
against themselves .
That was a very sensible
answer of
Dionysius the younger , 27 to whom his father , in reproaching
him
with a dishonourable
action , said : " Have I set you the example
in
this ?"
" Ah ! " replied
the
son , " your
father
was not a
king."
All things
conspire
to
deprive
of justice
and
reason
a man
brought up to govern
others .
Much trouble
is taken , so it is said ,
to teach
young
princes the art of reigning
; this education
does
not appear to profit them .
It would be better to begin by teach-
ing them the art of obeying .
The greatest kings that history
has
celebrated
were not trained
to rule ; that is a science which men
are never less masters of than after
excessive study of it, and it is
better acquired
by obeying
than by ruling.
Nam utilissimus
idem
ac brevissimus
bonarum
malarumque
rerum
delectus , cogitare quid
aut nolueris sub alio principe , aut volueris.28
A result
of this want
of cohesion
is the
instability of royal
government ,
which,
being
regulated
sometimes
on
one
plan,
sometimes
on another , according
to the character of the reigning
prince
or that
of the
persons who
reign
for him ,
cannot
long
pursue a fixed aim or a consistent
course
of conduct , a variable-
ness which always makes the State fluctuate
between
maxim
and
maxim , project and
project , and which does not
exist in other
governments , where the Prince is always
the
same.
So we see
that, in general , if there is more cunning
in a court , there is more
wisdom in a senate, and that republics
pursue their ends by more
steadfast and
regular
methods
; whereas
every
revolution
in
a
royal ministry
produces
one in the State , the
maxim
common
to


Monarchy .
167
7
all ministers , and
to
almost
all kings , being to reverse
in
every
respect
the acts of their predecessors .
From this same want of cohesion
is obtained
the solution of a
sophism very familiar to
royal
politicians ;
this
is not only to
compare
civil
government
with
domestic
government , and
the
prince with the father of a family , an
error
already refuted , but ,
further, to ascribe
freely to this magistrate all the virtues which he
might have occasion
for, and always to suppose that the prince is
what he ought to be- on which supposition
royal government
is
manifestly
preferable
to every other , because it is incontestably
the
strongest ,
and
because
it only lacks
a
corporate will
more
conformable
to the general will to be also the best .
But if, according
to Plato ,29 a king by nature is
so rare
a per-
sonage , how many times will nature and fortune
conspire
to crown
him ?
And if the royal
education
necessarily
corrupts
those who
receive
it, what
should
be
expected
from
a
succession
of men
trained
to rule ?
It
is, then , voluntary
self-deception
to confuse
royal government
with that of a good king.
To see what
this
government
is in itself, we must
consider
it under incapable
or
wicked princes
; for such will come to the
throne , or the throne
will make them such.30
These
difficulties
have not
escaped
our authors ,31 but they
have not been
embarrassed
by them .
The remedy , they say, is
to obey without
murmuring
; God gives
bad
kings
in
his wrath ,
and we must endure them
as chastisements of heaven .
Such talk
is doubtless
edifying , but I am inclined to think it would be more
appropriate
in a pulpit than in a book on politics .
What should
we say of a physician
who
promises
miracles , and whose
whole
art consists in exhorting
the sick man
to
be
patient ?
We know
well that when we have
a bad government
it must
be
endured
;
the question
is to find a good
one .


CHAPTER VII.
MIXED GOVERNMENTS .
PROPERLY speaking , there is no simple
government.32
A single
chief must have
subordinate
magistrates ; a popular government
must have a head .
Thus , in the partition
of the executive
power ,
there is
always a gradation
from the greater number to the less,
with this difference , that
sometimes
the majority depends on the
minority, and sometimes the minority on the majority.
Sometimes
there
is
an
equal
division , either
when
the
con-
stituent
parts are in mutual
dependence , as in the government
of
England ; 33 or when
the authority of each
part is independent
,
but imperfect , as in Poland.3
This
latter form
is bad , because
there
is no
unity
in
the
government ,
and
the
State
lacks
cohesion .
34
Is a simple
or a mixed
government
the
better ?
A question
much
debated
among
publicists ,
and
one to
which the
same
answer must be made that I have
before
made
about
every form
of government .
The simple
government
is the
better
in itself, for the reason
that it is simple .
But when the executive power is not sufficiently
dependent
on the legislative , that is , when there is a greater
pro-
portion between
the
Prince and the
sovereign
than between the
people
and the Prince, this want of proportion must be remedied
by dividing the government
;
for then all
its
parts
have no less
authority
over
the
subjects
,
and
their division renders
them all
together
less strong
against the sovereign
.
The same inconvenience
is
also provided
against by the estab-
lishment of intermediate
magistrates
,
who
,
leaving the government
in
its
entirety
,
only serve
to
balance
the two powers and maintain
their respective
rights
.
Then
the
government
is
not mixed
,
but
temperate
.
The opposite
inconvenience
can be remedied by similar means
,
and
,
when the government
is
too
lax
,
tribunals
may be erected
168


Mixed
Governments ,
169
to concentrate it .
That is customary
in all democracies
.
In the
first case the government
is divided in order to weaken it, and in
the second in order to strengthen it ; for the maximum of strength
and also of weakness is found in
simple
governments , while the
mixed forms give a medium
strength .


i
CHAPTER VIII .
THAT EVERY FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT FIT FOR
EVERY COUNTRY
LIBERTY ,35 not
being
a fruit of all climates ,
is not within the
reach of all peoples .
The
more we
consider
this
principle es-
tablished
by Montesquieu
, the more do we perceive
its truth ; the
more it is contested , the greater opportunity is given
to establish
it by new proofs .
In all the
governments
of the world, the
public person
con-
sumes , but produces
nothing. Whence, then , comes the substance
it consumes ?
From the labour of its
members . It is the super-
fluity of individuals that
supplies
the necessaries
of the public .
Hence it follows
that the civil
State
can
subsist
only so long as
men's labour produces
more than they need .
Now this excess is not the same in all countries
of the world.
In
several
it
is
considerable , in
others
moderate , in
others
nothing, in others
a minus
quantity .
This
proportion depends
on the fertility due to climate , on the kind of labour which the
soil
requires , on
the
nature
of
its
products
,
on
the
physical
strength of its
inhabitants
,
on the
greater
or
less
consumption
that
is
necessary
to
them
,
and on several other like proportions
of
which
it
is
composed
.
On the other hand
,
all governments
are not
of
the same nature
;
there
are
some
more
or less
wasteful
;
and the differences
are
based on this other
principle
,
that
the further
the public contri-
butions
are removed
from
their source
,
the
more
burdensome
they are
.
We
must
not measure this
burden
by the amount of
the imposts
,
but by the distance
they have
to
traverse
in
order
to
return to the hands from which they have come
.
When this
cir-
culation
is
prompt
and well
-
established
,
it
matters
not
whether
little
or
much
is
paid
;
the
people
are
always
rich
,
and
the
finances
are
always
prosperous
.
On
the
other
hand
,
however
little the people may contribute
,
if
this little
does not revert
to
them
,
they are soon exhausted by constantly
giving
;
the
State
is
never rich and the people
are always
in
beggary
36

It follows
from this that the
more the
distance
between
the
people and the government
is
increased , the
more
burdensome
do the tributes
become
;
therefore , in
a democracy
the
people
are least
encumbered , in an aristocracy
they are more so, and in
a monarchy
they bear the
greatest
weight .
Monarchy , then , is
suited only to
wealthy
nations
; aristocracy , to States
moderate
both in wealth and size ; democracy , to
small and poor States .
Indeed , the more we reflect on it, the more do we find in this
the difference
between free and monarchical
States .
In the first,
everything
is used
for the
common
advantage
; in the
others ,
public and private
resources
are reciprocal
, and
the
former
are
increased
by the diminution of
the
latter ;
lastly ,
instead
of
governing subjects
in
order to
make
them
happy , despotism 37
renders
them miserable in order to govern
them .
There
are, then , in
every climate
natural
causes by which we
can assign the form of government
which is adapted
to the nature
of the climate , and even say what kind of inhabitants
the country
should have .
Unfruitful and barren places , where the produce
does not repay
the labour, ought to remain
uncultivated
and
deserted , or should
only be peopled
by savages ; places where
men's
toil yields
only
bare necessaries ought to be inhabited
by barbarous
nations
; in
them
any polity would be an impossibility.
Places
where
the
excess of the produce
over
the labour is moderate
are
suitable
for free nations
; those in which abundant
and
fertile
soil yields
much
produce
for little
labour
are
willing
to be
governed
monarchically, in order that the superfluity of the
subjects
may
be consumed
by the luxuries
of the Prince ; for it is better
that
this
excess
should
be
absorbed
by
the
government
than
squandered
by private
persons .
There are
exceptions , I know ;
but these exceptions
themselves
confirm
the rule , in that , sooner
or later , they produce
revolutions
which restore
things to their
natural
order .
We should
always distinguish
general
laws from the particular
causes which may modify their effects. If the whole
south should
be covered
with republics , and
the
whole
north
with
despotic
States , it would not
be
less true that , through
the
influence
of
climate , despotism
is suitable
to warm countries , barbarism to cold
countries , and a good polity to intermediate
regions . I see, how-
ever , that while the principle is admitted , its application
may be
disputed
; it will be said that some cold countries
are very fertile ,
and some
southern
ones very unfruitful. ) But this is
a difficulty
only for those who do not examine the matter in all its
relations .


172
The Social Contract .
It is necessary , as I have
already
said , to reckon
those connected
with labour, resources , consumption
, etc.
Let us suppose
that the produce of two districts
equal in area
is in the ratio
of five to ten . If the inhabitants
of the former
consume
four
and
those
of the latter nine
parts , the
surplus
produce of the first will
be one-fifth , and that of the second one-
tenth .
The
ratio between
these
two
surpluses
being
then in-
versely as that of the
produce
of each , the district which yields
only five will
give
a surplus
double
that of the
district which
produces
ten .
But it is not a question
of double
produce , and I do not think
that any one dare , in general , place the fertility of cold countries
even on an equality with that of warm countries .
Let us, how-
ever , assume this equality
; let us, if you will, put England in the
scales
with
Sicily, and
Poland with Egypt ; more
to the south
we shall have Africa and
India ; more to the north we shall have
nothing.
For this
equality
in produce
what
a difference
in the
cultivation !
In Sicily it is only necessary to scratch the soil ; in
England what care is needed
to till it !
But where more exertion
is required
to yield the same produce , the surplus must necessarily
be very small .
"We
Consider, besides
this , that the same number of men consume
much less in warm countries .
The climate
demands
that people
should be temperate
in
order
to be healthy
;
Europeans
who
want to live as at home all die of dysentry
and dyspepsia .
are," says Chardin ,38 " carnivorous
beasts, wolves , in comparison
with Asiatics .
Some attribute
the temperance
of the Persians to
the fact that their
country
is
scantily
cultivated
; I believe , on
the contrary , that their country
is not very abundant
in provisions
because
the inhabitants
need very little .
If their
frugality ," he
continues , " resulted
from
the poverty of the country , it would be
only the
poor who
would
eat little, whereas it
is the people
generally ; and more or less would be consumed in each province ,
according to the fertility of the country , whereas
the
same
ab-
stemiousness
is
found throughout
the kingdom .
They
pride
themselves
greatly on their mode
of living, saying that it is only
necessary to look at their complexions , to see how much superior

nations .

differences .
In climates.

sought

than
utility, for
clothes themselves
are a luxury.
At Naples you will see men
every day walking
to Posilippo with gold-embroidered
coats , and
no stockings .
It is the same with regard to buildings
; everything
is sacrificed
to magnificence
when
there
is nothing to fear from
injury by the atmosphere .
In Paris and in London people
must
be warmly and comfortably
housed
; in Madrid they have superb
drawing-rooms , but no windows
that shut , while they sleep in mere
closets .
The foods are much more substantial
and
nutritious
in warm
countries
; this is a third
difference
which
cannot fail to influence
the second .
Why do
people
eat
so
many
vegetables
in Italy ?
Because they are good , nourishing , and of excellent
flavour .
In
France , where they are grown only on water , they are not nourish-
ing and count almost for nothing on the table ; they do not, how-
ever , occupy
less ground , and
they cost
at least as
much labour
to cultivate .
It is found
by experience
that the wheats of Barbary ,
inferior in
other
respects
to those
of France, yield much
more
flour, and that
those
of France, in their turn , yield more
than
the wheats
of the north .
Whence
we
may infer that
a similar
gradation
is observable
generally , in the same direction , from the
Equator to the Pole .
Now is it not
a manifest
disadvantage
to
have in an equal
quantity
of produce
a smaller
quantity of nuti-
ment ?
To all these
different
considerations I
may add
one which
springs
from , and
strengthens , them ; it is that
warm
countries
have less
need of inhabitants
than
cold countries , but would be
able to maintain
a greater number
; hence a double surplus
is pro-
duced, always
to the advantage
of despotism .

certed
promptly
and
secretly , and
because
it is always easy for
the government
to
discover
the plans
and
cut off communica-
tions.39
But the more closely
packed
a numerous population
is,
the less power
has a government
to usurp
the sovereignty
; the
chiefs
deliberate
as securely in their
cabinets
as the prince in his
council , and the multitude
assemble in the
squares
as quickly as
the troops in their quarters .
The advantage , then , of a tyrannical
government
lies in this, that it acts at great
distances .
By help
of the points of support which it procures , its power increases with
the distance , like
that of levers .*
That of the people , on the
other hand , acts only when
concentrated
; it evaporates and dis-
appears as it extends , like the effect of powder
scattered on the
ground, which takes fire
only grain
by grain .
The
least
popu-
lous countries
are thus the best adapted for tyranny
; wild
beasts
reign only in deserts .
* This does
not contradict
what I said
before
(Book II. chapter
ix.) on the inconveniences of large States ; for there it was a question
of the authority of the government over its members, and here it is a
question of its power against its subjects.
Its scattered members serve
as points of support to it for operating at a distance upon the people,
but it has no point of support for acting on its members themselves .
Thus , the length of the lever is the cause of its
weakness in the one
case, and of its strength in the other.

CHAPTER
IX .
THE MARKS OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT.
WHEN, then , it is asked absolutely
which is the best government ,
an insoluble
and likewise
indeterminate
question
is propounded
;
or, if you
will , it has
as many
correct
solutions
as
there
are
possible
combinations
in the absolute
and
relative
positions
of
the nations .
But if it were
asked
by what sign it can
be known
whether
a
given
people
is well or
ill
governed
,
that
would
be
a
different
matter
,
and the question
of
fact might be determined
.
It
is,
however
,
not settled
,
because every one wishes
to
decide
it
in
his own way
.
Subjects
extol the public tranquillity
,
citizens
the liberty of individuals
;
the former prefer security
of
possessions
,
the latter
,
that
of
persons
;
the former
are
of
opinion that the best
government
is
the
most
severe
,
the latter
maintain
that
it
is
the
mildest
;
the one party wish that crimes
should
be punished
and
the other that they
should
be prevented
;
the
one
party think
it
well
to
be feared by their neighbours
,
the other party prefer
to
be
unacquainted
with them
;
the one party are satisfied when money
circulates
,
the other party
demand
that the
people
should
have
bread
.
Even
though
there
should
be
agreement
on these
and
other similar
points
,
would further
progress
be
made
?
Since
moral
quantities
lack
a
precise
mode
of
measurement
,
even
if
people
were
in
accord about the sign
,
how could
they be
so
about
the valuation
of
it
?
For my part
,I
am
always astonished
that people fail
to
recog-
nize
a
sign
so
simple
,
or
that they
should
have the insincerity
not
to
agree about
it
.
What
is
theobject
of
political
association
?
It
is
the preservation
and prosperity
of
its
members
.
And what
is
the surest sign that they are
preserved
and
prosperous
?
It
is
their number
and population
.

* On the same principle must be judged the centuries which deserve
preference in respect of the prosperity of the human race.
Those in
which
literature and art were seen
to flourish
have been too
much
admired without the secret object oftheir cultivation being penetrated ,
without their fatal consequences being considered :
Idque apud im-
peritos humanitas

Shall we
never detect in the
maxims of books the gross
self-interest
which
makes the authors speak ?
No, whatever they may say, when , not-
withstanding its brilliancy , a country is being depopulated , it is untrue
that all goes well , and it is not enough that a poet should have an in-
come of 100,000 livres for his epoch to be the of best all.
The apparent
repose and tranquillity of the chief men must be regarded less than the
welfare of nations as a whole , and especially that of the most populous
States.
Hail lays waste a few cantons , but it rarely causes
scarcity .
Riots
and civil wars greatly startle the chief men ;
but they do not
produce the real misfortunes of nations , which
may even be abated ,
while it is being disputed who shall tyrannize
over them . It is from
their permanent
condition
that
their
real prosperity
or calamities
spring
; when all is left crushed under the yoke , it is then that every-
thing perishes ; it is then that the chief men, destroying them at their
leisure , ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant .
When the broils
of the great agitated the kingdom of France , and the coadjutor of Paris
carried a poniard in his pocket to the Parlement , that did not prevent
the French nation from living
happily
and harmoniously
in free and
honourable
ease .
Greece of old flourished
in the midst of the
most
cruel wars ; blood flowed there in streams, and the whole country
was
covered with men.
It seemed , said
Machiavelli , that amid murders ,
proscriptions
and
civil
wars, our republic 43became more powerful
;
the virtues of its
citizens, their
manners , their
independence , were
more effectual in strengthening it than all its dissensions had been in
weakening it.
A little
agitation
gives energy to men's minds , and
what makes the race truly prosperous is not so much peace as liberty .

CHAPTER
X.
THE ABUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS TENDENCY
TO DEGENERATE.44
As the particular
will acts incessantly
against the general
will,
so
the government
makes a continual effort against the
sovereignty .
The more this effort
is increased , the
more
is the
constitution
aitered
; and
as there is here no
other
corporate
will which , by
resisting
that
of the Prince, may produce
equilibrium
with
it , it
must happen
sooner
or later that the Prince at length
oppresses
the
sovereign
and
violates
the
social
treaty .
Therein
is the
inherent and inevitable
vice
which, from the birth of the body
politic , tends
without
intermission
to
destroy it, just
as old
age
and death at length
destroy the human body.
There are two general ways by which a government
degenerates ,
viz . when it contracts , or when the State is dissolved .
•
The government
contracts
when it passes from the majority to
the
minority,
that
is,
from
democracy
to aristocracy ,
and
from
aristocracy to
royalty .
That
is
its
natural
tendency
.*
If
it
*
The slow formation
and the progress
of
Venice
in
her lagoons
present
a
notable example
of
this succession
;
it
is
indeed astonishing
that
,
after more than twelve hundred years
,
the Venetians
seem to be
still only
in
the second
stage
which
began with the Serrar di Con-
siglio
in
1198.
As for the
ancient
Doges
,
with whom they are re-
proached
,
whatever the Squittinio
della libertà
veneta
may
say
,
it
is
proved that they were not their sovereigns.45
People will not fail
to
bring
forward
as
an objection
to
my views
the Roman
Republic
,
which
followed
,
it
will be said
,
a
course quite
contrary
,
passing from Monarchy
to
aristocracy
,
and from aristocracy
to
democracy
.I
am very far from regarding
it
in
this way
.
The first institution
of
Romulus
was
a
mixed government
,
which
speedily
degenerated into despotism
.
From peculiar causes
the State
perished
before its time
,
as
we see
a
new
-
born babe die before attain-
ing manhood
.
The expulsion
of
the Tarquins
was the real epoch
of
the birth
of
the
Republic
.
But
it
did not
at
first assume
a
regular
form
,
because
,
through not abolishing
the patrician order
,
only
a
half
of the work
was done
.
For
,
in
this way
,
the hereditary
aristocracy
,
177

The Social Contract .
retrograded
from the minority to the majority , it might be said to
relax ; but this inverse progress is impossible .
46
In reality , the government
never changes its form
except
when
its exhausted
energy leaves it too weak to preserve itself ; and if it
becomes still more relaxed as it extends , its
force
will
be annihi-
lated , and it will no
longer
subsist .
We must
therefore
concen-
trate the energy as it dwindles
; otherwise
the State which it sus-
tains will fall into ruin.
The dissolution
of the State may occur in two ways .
Firstly , when the Prince no longer administers
the State in
accordance
with the laws and effects a usurpation
of the sovereign
power .
Then
a
remarkable
change
takes
place-the
State ,
and
not the
government ,
contracts
; I
mean
that the
State
dissolves , and that another
is formed within it, which is composed
only of the members of the government , and which is to the
rest
of the people nothing
more than their master and their tyrant .
So
that as soon as the government
usurps the sovereignty , the social
compact
is broken , and all the ordinary
citizens , rightfully regain-
ing their
natural
liberty , are forced , but not morally bound , to
obey .
The same thing
occurs
also when the members of the
govern-
which is the worst of legitimate administrations , remaining in
conflict
with the democracy , the form of the government , always
uncertain
and
fluctuating , was
fixed ,
as
Machiavelli
has shown , only
on the
institution
of the tribunes ; not till then was there a real government
and
a true
democracy .
Indeed ,
the
people
then
were
not
only
sovereign , but also magistrates and judges ; the
Senate
was only a
subordinate tribunal for moderating and concentrating the government
;
and the consuls themselves, although patricians , although chief magis-
trates, although generals with absolute authority in war, were in Rome
only the presidents of the people.
From that
time , moreover , the government
seemed
to follow its
natural inclination , and tend strongly
to aristocracy .
The patriciate
abolishing
itself as it were, the aristocracy was no longer in the body
of patricians
as it is at
Venice
and
Genoa , but in the body of the
Senate, composed of patricians
and plebeians , and
also in the body
oftribunes when they began to usurp an active power ; for words make
no difference in things , and when a nation
has
chiefs to
govern for
them , whatever
name those
chiefs bear, they always form
an aristo-
cracy.
From the abuse of aristocracy sprang the civil wars and the trium-
virate .
Sylla , Julius Cæsar, Augustus , became in fact real monarchs
;
and at length , under the despotism of Tiberius , the State was broken
Roman history , then , does not belie my principle , but confirms it.

The Abuse of the
Government .
179
ment usurp
separately
the power
which they
ought
to
exercise
only collectively
; which is no
less a violation of the
laws , and
occasions
still
greater
disorder .
Then there are, so to speak , as
many Princes as magistrates
; and the State , not less divided than
the government , perishes
or changes its form .
When the State
is broken up, the
abuse
of the
government ,
whatever
it may
be, takes
the
common
name
of anarchy .
To
distinguish
, democracy
degenerates
into ochlocracy
,47 aristocracy
into oligarchy ; I should add that royalty degenerates into tyranny ;
but this last word
is equivocal
and requires
explanation
.
In the vulgar sense a tyrant is a king who governs with violence
and without
regard to justice
and
the laws .
In the strict sense,
a tyrant is a private
person
who
arrogates to
himself the
royal
authority without
having
a right to it. It is in this
sense that the
Greeks understood
the word tyrant ; 48 they bestowed
it indiffer-
ently on good and bad princes whose authority
was not legitimate .*
Thus tyrant and usurper are two words
perfectly
synonymous
.
To give
different
names to different
things , I call the
usurper
of royal
authority a tyrant, and the usurper of sovereign
power
a
despot.
The tyrant is he who , contrary
to the
laws ,
takes
upon
himself to govern
according
to the
laws ; the despot
is he who
sets himself above the laws themselves .
Thus the tyrant
cannot
be a despot , but the despot
is always
a tyrant .
* Omnes
enim et habentur et dicuntur
tyranni , qui potestate
utuntur
perpetua
in
ea
civitate
quae
libertate
usa
est.
(Corn . Nep., in
Miltiad., cap. viii .)49 It is true that Aristotle
(Mor . Nicom ., Book VIII .
cap . x.) distinguishes
the tyrant
from the
king , by the
circumstance
that the former governs for his own benefit, and the latter only for the
benefit of his subjects ; but besides the fact
that , in general , all the
Greek
authors
have taken
the word
tyrant
in a different
sense , as
appears
especially
from
Xenophon's
Hiero, it
would
follow
from
Aristotle's
distinction
that , since the beginning
o
the
world , not a
single king has yet existed.


CHAPTER XI.
THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY POLITIC .
SUCH is the
natural
and inevitable
tendency
of the
best
con-
stituted
governments . If Sparta
and Rome have perished , what
State can hope to endure for ever ? If we wish to form a durable
constitution
,
let
us, then , not dream
of making
it eternal .
In
order to succeed
we must not attempt the impossible , nor flatter
ourselves
that we are giving
to the work of men a stability which
human things do not admit of.
The body politic, as well as the human body , begins to die from
its birth ,
and
bears in
itself the
causes
of its
own
destruction .
But both may have a constitution
more or less robust , and
fitted
to preserve
them
a longer
or shorter
time .
The
constitution
of
man is the work of nature ; that of the
State is the work of art.50
It does
not rest with men to prolong
their lives ; it does
rest
with them to prolong
that of the State as far as possible , by giving
it the best
constitution
practicable .
The
best
constituted
will
come to an end , but not so soon as another , unless
some unfore-
seen accident
brings
about its premature
destruction
.
The principle of political life is in the sovereign
authority .
The
legislative
power is the heart of the State ; the executive power is
its brain, giving movement
to all the parts .
The brain may
be
paralysed
and yet the individual may live .
A man
remains
an
imbecile and lives ; but
so soon as the heart ceases
its
functions
,
the animal
dies
.
It
is
not by laws that the State subsists
,
but by the legislative
power
.
The
law
of
yesterday
is
not binding
to
-
day
;
but tacit
consent
is
presumed
from silence
,
and the
sovereign
is
supposed
to
confirm
continually the laws which
it
does
not abrogate when
able to do so
.
Whatever
it
has once declared
that
it
wills
,
it
wills
always
,
unless the declaration
is
revoked
.
Why
,
then
,
do people
show
so
much
respect for ancient
laws
?
It
is
on account
of
their antiquity
.
We must
believe
that
it
is
only the excellence
of the ancient
laws which has enabled
them
to
be
so
long preserved
;
unless the sovereign
has recognized
them
180


The Dissolution
of the Body Politic .
181
?
as constantly
salutary , it would
have
revoked
them a thousand
times .
That is why, far from
being
weakened , the laws are ever
acquiring fresh vigour in every well -constituted
State ;
the
pre-
judice in favour
of antiquity
renders
them
more
venerable
day ; while , wherever
laws are
weakened
as they grow
old, this
fact proves that there is no longer any legislative
power , and that
the State no longer lives .
every
CHAPTER XII.
HOW THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY
IS MAINTAINED
.
THE
Sovereign , having no other force than the
legislative
power ,
acts
only through the
laws ;
and the laws
being
nothing but
authentic
acts of the general will , the sovereign
can act only when
the people
are assembled .
The people assembled , it will be said ;
what
a chimera
!
It is a chimera
to-day ; but it was not so two
thousand
years ago .
Have men changed their nature ?
The limits of the possible in moral things are less
narrow than
we think ; it is our weaknesses , our vices , our prejudices , that
con-
tract them .
Sordid souls do not believe in great men ; vile slaves
smile with a mocking air at the word
liberty .
From what has been done let us
consider
what
can
be
done .
I shall
not
speak
of the
ancient
republics
of Greece
; but the
Roman Republic was, it seems to me, a great
State , and the city
of Rome a great
city .
The
last
census
in
Rome
showed
that
there were 400,000
citizens bearing
arms , and the last enumeration
of the Empire
showed
more
than
4,000,000
citizens , without
reckoning
subjects , foreigners , women , children , and slaves .
What a difficulty , we might
suppose , there would be in assem-
bling frequently
the enormous
population
of the
capital
and its
environs .
Yet few weeks passed without the Roman people
being
assembled , even several times.51
Not only did
they exercise the
rights of sovereignty , but a part of the functions
of government
.
They discussed
certain affairs
and
judged
certain
causes, and in
the public assembly
the whole
people
were almost
as often magis-
trates as citizens .
By going
back to the early times of nations , we should find that
the majority
of the ancient
governments , even
monarchical
ones ,
like those of the Macedonians
and the Franks, had similar councils .
Be that as it may , this single incontestable
fact solves all difficulties
;
inference
from the actual to the possible
appears to me sound .
182


CHAPTER XIII .
HOW THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY
IS MAINTAINED
(continued ).
Tr is not sufficient
that
the
assembled
people
should
have once
fixed the
constitution
of the State by giving their
sanction
to a
body of laws ; it is not sufficient that they should
have established
a perpetual
government , or
that
they
should
have
once
for all
provided for the election of magistrates .
Besides the extraordinary
assemblies which
unforeseen
events may
require , it
is
necessary
that there should be fixed and periodical
ones
which nothing can
abolish or prorogue
; so that , on the
appointed
day , the
people
are rightfully
convoked
by the law,
without
needing
for that
purpose
any formal summons .
But, excepting
these
assemblies which are lawful by their date
alone , every assembly of the people
that
has not been
convoked
by the magistrates
appointed
for that duty and
according
to the
prescribed
forms , ought to be regarded
as
unlawful
and all that is
done in it as invalid , because even the order
to assemble ought to
emanate from the law.
As for the more or less frequent meetings of the lawful assemblies ,
they depend on so many considerations
that no precise rules can
be given
about
them .
Only
it may
be
said
generally
that
the
more force
a
government
has, the
more
frequently
should
the
sovereign
display itself.
This , I shall be told, may be good
for a single
city ; but what
is to be done
when the
State
comprises
many cities ?
Will the
sovereign
authority
be divided ?
Or must it be concentrated
in a
single city and render subject all the rest ?
In the first place ,
I answer that neither alternative
is necessary .
the sovereign
authority
is
simple
and
undivided
, and
we cannot
divide it without
destroying
it.
In the
second
place , a city , no
more than a nation , can
be lawfully subject
to
another , because
the essence of the body politic consists in the union of obedience
and liberty , and these words , subject
and
sovereign , are correlatives ,
183

184
The Social Contract .
the notion
underlying
them
being
expressed in the one
word
citizen .
I answer , further , that it is always an evil to
combine
several
towns into a single State , and , in desiring
to
effect such
a union ,,
we
must
not
flatter
ourselves
that we
shall
avoid
the
natural
inconveniences
of it.
The
abuses
of great
States
cannot
be
brought
as an objection
against
a man who only desires
small
ones.52
But
how can
small
States be
endowed with
sufficient
force
to
resist
great
ones ?
Just in the same way
as
when
the
Greek towns of old resisted the Great King,53 and as more recently
Holland
and Switzerland
have resisted the House of Austria .
If, however , the
State cannot
be reduced
to proper
limits ,
one
resource still remains
; it is not to allow any capital , but to
make
the government
sit alternately
in each town , and also to assemble
in them by turns the estates of the country .
People the territory
uniformly , extend the same
rights
every-
where , spread
everywhere
abundance
and
life ; in this way the
State
will
become
at once the strongest and
the
best
governed
that may be possible .
Remember
that the walls of the towns
are
formed
solely of the remains of houses in the country .
For every
palace
that I see rising in the capital , I seem to see a whole
rural
district laid in ruins .


CHAPTER XIV.
HOW THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY
IS MAINTAINED
(continued ) .
So
soon
as
the
people
are
lawfully
assembled
as
a
sovereign
body , the whole jurisdiction of the government
ceases, the execu-
tive power is suspended , and the person of the meanest
citizen
is
as sacred
and inviolable
as that of the
first
magistrate , because
where the represented
are, there is no longer any representative.54
Most of the tumults
that arose in Rome in the comitia
proceeded
from
ignorance
or neglect
of this rule .
The consuls
were then
only presidents
of the people
and the tribunes
simple
orators ;
the Senate had no power at all.
*
These intervals
of suspension , in which the Prince recognizes
or
ought
to recognize
the presence
of a superior , have always
been
dreaded by that power ; and these assemblies of the people , which
are the shield of the body politic and the curb of the government ,
have
in all
ages been the terror of the chief men ; hence
such
men are
never
wanting
in solicitude , objections
,
obstacles ,
and
promises , in the endeavour
to make the citizens
disgusted with the
assemblies .
When
the latter
are avaricious , cowardly ,
pusillani-
mous , and more desirous of repose than of freedom , they do not
long hold out against the repeated
efforts of the government
; and
thus ,
as the
resisting
force
constantly
increases , the
sovereign
authority at last disappears , and most of the States decay and perish
before
their time .
But
between
the sovereign
authority
and the arbitrary
govern-
ment there is sometimes
introduced
an intermediate
power of
which I must speak .
* Almost_in_the
sense
given to this term
in the Parliament
of
England.
The resemblance between their offices
would have set the
consuls and tribunes
in conflict , even if all jurisdiction
had been
sus-
pended .

CHAPTER XV.
DEPUTIES
OR REPRESENTATIVES
.
So soon
as the
service of the
State
ceases
to be the
principal
business
of the citizens , and
they prefer to render aid with their
purses rather than their persons , the State is already
on the brink
of ruin .
Is it necessary to march
to battle , they pay troops and
remain
at home ; is it necessary to go to the council, they elect
deputies
and
remain
at
home .
As a result of indolence
and
wealth , they at length
have soldiers
to
enslave
their
country
and
representatives
to sell it.55
It is the bustle of commerce
and of the arts, it is the greedy
pursuit of gain , it is effeminacy
and
love of comforts , that
com-
mute
personal
services for
money .
Men
sacrifice
a portion of
their profit in
order
to
increase
it
at their
ease .
Give money
and soon
you will
have
chains .
That word finance
is a slave's
word ; it is unknown among citizens .
In a country
that
is really
free , the citizens
do everything
with their hands and nothing
with
money ; far from
paying
for exemption
from
their
duties , they
would pay
to perform
them themselves
.
I
am
far
removed
from ordinary ideas ; I believe that
statute -labour (
les
corvées
)
is
less repugnant
to
liberty
than taxation
is.56
The
better
constituted
a
State
is,
the
more
do public affairs
outweigh
private
ones
in
the minds
of the
citizens
.
There
is
,
indeed
,
a
much smaller
number
of
private
affairs
,
because the
amount
of
the
general
prosperity
furnishes
a
more considerable
portion
to
that
of
each individual
,
and less remains
to
be sought
by individual exertions
.
In
a
well
-
conducted
city
-
state every one
hastens to the assemblies
;
while
under
a
bad
government
no
one cares
to
move
a
step
in
order
to
attend them
,
because no one
takes an interest
in
the proceedings
,
since
it
is
foreseen
that
the
general
will
will not prevail
;
and
so
at
last
private
concerns
become all
-
absorbing
.
Good
laws pave the way for better ones
;
bad laws lead to worse
ones
.
As soon
as
any one
says
of
the
186


Deputies or Representatives .
187
affairs of the State , " Of what
importance
are they to me ? " we
must consider that the State is lost.
The decline
of patriotism , the active pursuit
of private interests ,
the vast
size of States , conquests , and the abuses of government ,
have
suggested
the
plan
of deputies
or
representatives
of the
people in the assemblies of the nation .
It is this which in certain
countries
they
dare to call the third
estate .
Thus the
private
interest
of two
orders
is put in the first
and
second
rank, the
public interest only in the third .
Sovereignty
cannot
be
represented
for the same reason that it
cannot be alienated
; it consists
essentially
in the
general
will ,
and the will
cannot
be
represented
; it is the
same
or it is dif-
ferent ; there is no medium .
The deputies of the people , then ,
are
not and
cannot
be its
representatives
;
they
are
only
its
commissioners
and
can
conclude
nothing
definitely .
Every law
which the people
in person have not ratified is invalid ; it is not
a law.
The English nation
thinks that it is free , but
is greatly
mistaken , for it is so only during the election
of members
of
Parliament ;
as soon
as they
are elected , it
is
enslaved
and
counts
for
nothing.57
The
use
which
it
makes
of the brief
moments
of freedom
renders the loss of liberty well -deserved .
The idea of representatives
is
modern
; it
comes
to us from
feudal
government ,
that
absurd
and
iniquitous
government ,58
under which mankind
is
degraded
and
the
name of man
dis-
honoured
.
In the
republics ,
and
even in the
monarchies , of
antiquity, the people
never
had
representatives
;
they
did
not
know the word .
It is very
singular
that in Rome, where the
tribunes
were so sacred , it was not even imagined
that they could
usurp
the functions
of the
people , and in the midst
of so great
a multitude , they
never attempted
to
pass of their own accord a
single
plebiscitum .
We
may judge,
however , of the
embarrass-
ment which the crowd sometimes
caused from what
occurred
in
the time of the Gracchi, when
a part of the citizens
gave their
votes on the house -tops.59
But where right and liberty are all in
all , inconveniences
are nothing .
In that
wise
nation
everything
was estimated
at a true
value ; it allowed
the
lictors
to do what
the tribunes
had
not
dared
to do , and
was not
afraid
that the
lictors would want to represent
it.60
To explain , however , in what
manner
the tribunes
sometimes
represented
it, it is
sufficient
to understand
how the government
represents
the sovereign.61
The law being
nothing but the de-
claration of the
general
will , it
is clear
that
in their legislative
capacity
the people
cannot
be
represented
; but they can
and


188
The Social Contract .
should be represented
in the
executive
power , which
is
only
force applied
to law.
This
shows that
very
few
nations
would ,
upon careful
examination , be found
to have
laws.62
Be that as
it may , it is
certain
that
the tribunes , having
no
share in the
executive
power, could never
represent
the Roman
people by
right of their office , but only by encroaching
on the rights of the
Senate .
Among the Greeks , whatever
the
people
had to
do, they did
themselves
; they
were constantly
assembled
in the public place .
They lived in
a
mild
climate
and they
were
not
avaricious
;
slaves performed
the manual labour
; the
people's
great
business
was liberty .
Not
having
the
same
advantages , how are you to
preserve the same rights
?
Your
more
rigorous
climates
give
you more wants
; * for six
months in a year the
public place
is
untenable , and your hoarse
voices
cannot
be heard
in the open
air.
You care
more for
gain
than
for
liberty,
and
you
fear
slavery far less than you do misery .
What
is liberty maintained
only with the
help
of slavery ?
Perhaps
; extremes
meet.63
Everything which
is not according
to nature
has
its
inconveniences
,
and civil
society
more than all
the rest
.
There
are
circumstances
so
unfortunate
that
people
can preserve their freedom only
at
the
expense
of
that of others
,
and the citizen
cannot be completely
free except
when
the
slave
is enslaved
to the utmost
.
Such was the position
of
Sparta
.
As
for you
,
modern
nations
,
you
have no slaves
,
but you are slaves
;
you pay for their freedom with your own
.
In vain do you boast
of this
preference
;I
find in
it
more
of
cowardice
than
of
humanity
.
I
do not mean by all this that
slaves
are
necessary
and
that
the right
of
slavery
is
lawful
,
since
I
have
proved
the contrary
;
I
only
mention
the
reasons
why modern
nations
who
believe
themselves
free
have
representatives
,
and
why
ancient
nations
had none
.
Be that
as
it
may
,
as
soon
as
a
nation
appoints
representatives
,
it
is
no longer
free
;
it
no longer exists
.
After very careful consideration
I
do not see that
it
is
possible
henceforward
for the
sovereign
to
preserve
among
us
the
exer-
cise of its rights unless the State
is
very
small
.
But

it

small, will it not be subjugated
?
No ; I shall show
hereafter *
how the external power of a great nation can be combined
with
the convenient
polity and good order of a small State .
* It is this which I had intended to do in the sequel to this work ,
when , in treating of
external
relations , I came to confederations — a
wholly new subject , the
principles
of which
have yet to be estab-
lished.64

CHAPTER XVI .
THAT THE INSTITUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT IS
NOT A CONTRACT .
THE legislative
power
being
once
well
established , the
question
is to
establish
also the executive
power ; for this
latter , which
operates only by particular
acts, not being of the essence of the
other ,
is
naturally
separated from it. If it were
possible
that
the sovereign ,
considered
as
such ,
should
have
the
executive
power , law and
fact
would be
so
confounded
that it could no
longer be known what
is law and what
is not ; and
the body
politic, thus perverted , would soon become a prey to the violence
against which it was instituted .
The
citizens
being
all
equal
by the
social
contract , all can
prescribe
what
all ought
to
do ,
while
no
one
has
a right to
demand
that
another
should
do
what
he will
not do
himself.
Now , it is properly
this right , indispensable
to
make
the
body
politic live and move , which the sovereign
gives to the Prince in
establishing
the government .
Several
have pretended
that the instrument
in this
establish-
ment is a contract
65 between the people
and the
chiefs
whom
they
set
over
themselves —a contract
by which it is stipulated
between the two parties on what
conditions
the one binds itself
to rule , the other
to
obey .
It will
be
agreed , I
am
sure , that
this is a strange method
of contracting .
But let
us see
whether
such a position is tenable .
First, the
supreme
authority
can no more
be modified
than
alienated
; to limit it
is to destroy it.
It is absurd and
contra-
dictory that the sovereign
should acknowledge
a superior
; to bind
itself to obey a master is to regain full liberty .
Further, it is evident
that this contract of the people
with such
or such persons is a particular
act ; whence
it follows that the
contract
cannot
be a law nor an act of sovereignty , and that
con-
sequently
it is unlawful .
Moreover, we see that the contracting
parties themselves
would
be under the law of nature
alone , and
without
any security for
190


Institution of Government
not a Contract .
191
the
performance
of their
reciprocal
engagements ,
which is in
every way repugnant
to the civil
state.
He who possesses the
power being
always
capable
of executing
it, we
might
as well
give the name
contract
to the act of a man
who should
say to
another : "I give
you
all my
property ,
on
condition that you
restore
me what you please .'
""
There is but one
contract
in
the
State
that of association
;
and this of itself excludes
any
other .
No public
contract
can
be conceived
which would not be a violation
of the first.
E

CHAPTER XVII .
THE INSTITUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT .
UNDER
what
general
notion , then , must be included
the
act by
which
the government
is instituted ? I shall
observe
first that
this act is complex , or composed of two others , viz . the
establish-
ment of the law and the execution
of the law .
By the first, the
sovereign
determines
that
there
shall be a
governing
body
established
in
such
or such a form ; and it is
clear that this act is a law.
By the
second ,
the
people
nominate
the
chiefs
who will
be
entrusted
with the government
when
established .
Now,
this
nomination
being
a particular
act , is not a second
law , but only
a consequence
of the first, and a function of the government
.
The
difficulty is
to
understand
how there
can
be an act of
government
before
the
government
exists , and how the
people ,
who are only sovereign
or subjects , can , in certain
circumstances
,
become the Prince or the magistrates .
Here, however , is disclosed
one of those astonishing
properties
of the body politic, by which it reconciles
operations
apparently
contradictory
; for this
is
effected
by a
sudden
conversion of
sovereignty
into democracy
in such a manner
that, without any
perceptible
change , and merely by a new relation
of all to
all
,
the
citizens
,
having
become
magistrates
,
pass from general
acts
to
particular
acts
,
and from the law
to
the execution of it.66
This change
of
relation
is
not
a
subtlety
of
speculation
without
example
in
practice
;
it
occurs
every day
in
the Parliament
of
England
,
in
which the Lower House on certain occasions
resolves
itself into Grand Committee
in
order
to
discuss
business
better
,
and thus
becomes
a
simple
commission
instead
of
the sovereign
court that
it
was
the moment
before
.
In this
way
it
afterwards
reports
to
itself
,
as
the House
of Commons
,
what
it
has just
decided
in
Grand Committee.67
Such
is
the advantage
peculiar
to
a
democratic
government
,
that
it
can be
established
in
fact by
a
simple act
of
the
general will
;
and after this
,
the provisional
government
remains
in
power
,
should

•
that be the form
adopted , or
establishes
in the
name
of the
sovereign
the government
prescribed
by the law ; and thus every-
thing
is according
to rule.
It is
impossible
to
institute
the
government
in any other way that is legitimate without
renouncing
the principles
heretofore
established .
CHAPTER XVIII .
MEANS OF PREVENTING
USURPATIONS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.68
FROM these explanations
it follows , in confirmation
of chapter XVI . ,
that
the
act which institutes
the government
is not a contract,
but a law ; that
the depositaries
of the
executive
power are not
the masters of the people , but
its
officers
;
that
the
people
can
appoint
them
and
dismiss
them
at
pleasure
;
that for them
it
is
not
a
question of contracting
,
but of obeying
;
and that
in
under-
taking the functions
which the State imposes on them
,
they simply
fulfil their duty
as
citizens
,
without
having
in
any way
a
right
to
discuss the conditions.69
When
,
therefore
,
it
happens
that the people
institute
a
heredi-
tary government
,
whether
monarchical
in
a
family
or
aristocratic
in one order of citizens
,
it
is
not an
engagement
that they make
,
but
a
provisional
form which they give
to
the administration
,
until
they please
to
regulate
it
differently
.
It
is
true that such changes are always
dangerous
,
and that the
established
government
must
never
be
touched
except when
it
becomes
incompatible with the
public
good
;
but this circum-
spection
is
a
maxim
of
policy
,
not
a
rule
of
right
;
and the State
is
no more bound
to
leave the civil authority
to
its chief men than
the military authority
to
its generals
.
Moreover
,
it
is
true
that
in
such
a
case
all the
formalities
requisite
to
distinguish
a
regular
and lawful act from
a
seditious
tumult
,
and
the will
of
a
whole
people
from the clamours of
a
faction
,
cannot
be too
carefully
observed
.
It
is
especially
in
this
case that only such
concessions
should
be
made
as
cannot
in
strict justice
be refused
;
and from this obligation
also the Prince
derives
a
great
advantage
in
preserving
its
power
in
spite
of
the
people
,
without
their
being
able
to
say that
it
has usurped the
power
;
for while appearing
to
exercise nothing but its rights
,
it
may very easily
extend
them
,
and
,
under
pretext
of
maintaining
the public peace
,
obstruct
the
assemblies
designed
to
re
-
establish
good order
;
so
that
it
takes
advantage
of
a
silence which
it
pre-

vents from
being broken , or of irregularities
which it causes to be
committed
, so as to assume in its favour the approbation
of those
whom
fear
renders
silent
and punish those
that
dare to speak .
It is in this way that the
Decemvirs
, having
at first
been
elected
for one year , and
then kept in office for another
year , attempted
to retain their power in perpetuity
by no longer
permitting
the
comitia to assemble ; and
it is by this easy method
that
all the
governments
in the world, when
once
invested
with
the
public
force, usurp sooner
or later the sovereign
authority .
The periodical
assemblies of which I have
spoken
before
are
fitted to prevent or postpone
this evil , especially
when
they need
no formal convocation
; for then the Prince cannot
interfere
with
them , without
openly
proclaiming
itself a violator of the laws and
an enemy of the State .
These assemblies , which have as their object the maintenance
of the social treaty , ought
always to be opened with two
proposi-
tions, which no one should
be able to suppress , and which
should
pass separately by vote .
:
The first
" Whether it pleases
the
sovereign
to maintain
the
present
form of government ."
The
second : " Whether
it pleases
the
people
to leave
the
administration
to those at present entrusted
with it."
Grotius 70
I presuppose
here what I believe
that I have
proved , viz. that
there is in the State no fundamental
law which cannot
be revoked ,
not even the social
compact
; for if all the
citizens
assembled
in
order to break
this
compact by a solemn
agreement , no one can
doubt that it would
be
quite
legitimately
broken .
even thinks that each man
can
renounce
the State of which he is
a member , and regain
his
natural
freedom
and
his
property
by
quitting the country .*
Now it would
be absurd if all the citizens
combined
should
be
unable
to
do
what
each
of them
can
do
separately .
* It must be clearly understood that no one should
leave in order
to evade his duty and relieve himself from serving
his
country at a
moment when it needs him.
Flight in that
case
would
be criminal
and punishable ; it would no longer be retirement , but desertion .


The Social Contract.
In the famous declaration
of the Pilgrim Fathers
on board
the
Mayflower (1620) , we find the
compact
theory actually applied
to practice , though
it must
be remembered
that
an independent
political
society was not
immediately
formed
: " We do solemnly
and mutually
in the
Presence
of God and of one another
cove
nant and combine
ourselves
together into a civil Body Politic ."
Another Puritan document , The Agreement of the People of Eng.
land, which emanated
from the army of the Parliament in
1647
expressly
affirms the sovereignty
of the people
and other " native
rights ."
The
fourth
article
declares : " That
the power of
this
and
all
future
Representatives
of this Nation is inferior only to
theirs
who chuse them , and
doth
extend without
the consent or
concurrence
of
any
other
person
or persons
to the
enacting
altering , and
repealing
of Lawes ; to the erecting
and
abolish
ing of
Offices
and
Courts ; to the appointing
, removing,
and
calling to account
magistrates
and officers
of all degrees ; to the
making
war and
peace , to the
treating
with
foraigne
States ;
and
generally
to whatsoever
is not
expressly or implyedly reserved
by
the represented
themselves ,"-the chief reservation
being
liberty
of conscience .*
66
In his
Tenure of Kings and Magistrates
(1649 ) , Milton
pro
pounds
similar
principles .
After affirming
that " all men
natu
rally
were
born free ,"
he
says
that
wrong
sprang
up
through
Adam's
sin ; wherefore , to avert
their
own complete
destruction ,
men
agreed
by common
league to bind each other from mutual
injury
and
jointly
to
defend
themselves
against
any that
gave
disturbance
or
opposition
to
such
agreement .
Hence
came
cities , towns , and commonwealths
."
Men having
ordained
some
authority to restrain by force all who violated
peace and common
right, "this authority
and power of self-defence and preservation ,
being originally and
naturally
in every one of them
and unitedly
in all," was vested in kings and
magistrates
as deputies and
com
missioners .
" The
Power of Kings
and
Magistrates
is nothing
else but what
is
only derivative , transferred , and

them in trust from the People to the common
good
of all,in whom
the
power
yet remains
fundamentally
and cannot
be
taken from
them without
a violation of their
natural
birthright."
Hence
nations
may choose
or
depose
kings, " merely by the right and
liberty of freeborn
men to be governed
as seems them best ."
Meanwhile
a totally opposite
theory
had been growing
up.
It
assumed that kingdoms
being
enlarged
families , the
patriarchal
authority of the head
of a
household
was transferred
by primo-
genitary descent to "the representative
of the first sovereign who
fcould
be historically proved
to have reigned
over
any nation .” *
Monarchy
was therefore
presumed
to rest on an indefeasible
right ,
and the king was held responsible
to God alone .
The celebrated
Spanish
Jesuit , Suarez ,
attacked
this
doctrine
of divine
right ,
appealing against it to Thomas Aquinas , to the civil laws , and to
the
great
canonists
and
casuists , " all of whom
agree that
the
ot prince has that
power of law-giving which the people
have given
him," the
reason
being
that " all men
are
born
equal ,"
and
consequently " no one has a political
jurisdiction
over
another ."
Adam's authority
was merely
patriarchal
, not political.
Political
power began when
families
were collected
into a community by
the
founders
of it.
The
people
therefore
might
depose a
bad
ruler .
As
Hallam
remarks , this
refutation
might
well
have
shamed
the English divines
who so
strenuously
and
servilely
upheld divine right .
Thomas Hobbes
(De Cive ,
1642
; De Corpore
Politico , 1650 ;
Leviathan,
1651 )
combined
the
doctrine
of the
unlimited
authority of the
sovereign , taught
by the
supporters
of the
patriarchal theory , with the rival doctrine
of an original
compact
of the
people .
He emphasized
forcibly the essential
features of
sovereignty , and
gave
prominence
and
distinctness
to the social
contract theory , which, after long
serving
as a basis
for the
de-
fence of popular
rights , now became
the foundation
of an
un-
compromising
doctrine
of passive obedience .
Hobbes's
defence
of absolutism
was secular and rationalistic
rather than theological .
* Hallam's
Literature of Europe , III . p. 160.

The Social Contract .
He regarded the happiness
of the community
as the great
end of
government .
66
According
to Hobbes , a man's impulses
are naturally
directed
to his own
preservation
and
pleasure , and
he cannot
reasonably
aim at anything
but
their gratification
.
Since , therefore , man is
unsociable
by nature , his
altruistic
actions
must
be ascribed
to
rational
self-interest .
In striking opposition
to the ancient
con-
ception
of the state of nature , Hobbes
depicted
it
as a state in
which " every man has a right to everything , even to one another's
body,"
a
state
in which every man is
at
war
with
his fellows ,
struggling
for safety , gain , or
glory ; in brief,
a
state
in which
"there
is
continual
fear
and
danger
of violent death , and the
life of man solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and
short ," like that of
savages.
Enlightened
self-interest
must
endeavour
to
escape
from such a miserable
and perilous condition.
No one feels safe,
for men
are
so equal
in the faculties of body
and
mind ” that
no one has
irresistible
superiority
over another .
Fear of death ,
then ,
and
desire
of
things
" necessary
to
commodious
living ,"
impel them to political
union , and
reason
suggests
convenient
articles of peace .
As mere agreement
would not
restrain men's
passions , a supreme common
power
is needed
to overawe
them .
Society is
formed
either
by " acquisition
," that
is , by forcible
subjection
of foes to
a conqueror
in
exchange
for life,
or by
"institution " (political
society
proper ), that
is, by a compact
according
to the terms of which
a common
power
is established
,
either one man or an assembly of men , that
may reduce all wills ,
by plurality of
voices , to one
will ,
and
" bear
their
person .'
" This is more than consent or concord
; it is a real unity of them
all in one and the same person ."
Hobbes defines the Leviathan *
or
commonwealth
as
one
person of whose
acts
a great
multi-
tude , by mutual
covenants
one
with
another , have
made them-
selves
every
one the author , to the end he
may use the strength
and means of them all as he shall think expedient
for their peace
"
* In his Introduction
to the
Leviathan , Hobbes
shows a dim per-
ception of the theory of a social
organism , comparing
the
common-
wealth to an 66artificial man," sovereignty to the soul, etc.

The Social Contract .

Sweeneyin
ministers
or
elective
or
limited
kings
are not sovereigns , but
authoritative
representatives
of the supreme power .
As to legis-
lation , "law in general is not counsel
but command ."
Civil laws
are commands
of the
sovereign , and
are the
standard
of right
and wrong
to his
subjects , sovereigns
themselves
being subject
only to the law of nature , which
is divine, and
can therefore
be
abrogated
by no man .
Since it would
not
be reasonable for
an
individual to obey the laws unless all others did so , the sovereign
must secure their general
observance .
The limits of sovereignty
are set by those
natural
and indefeasible
rights which
cannot be
surrendered
by any covenant .
Rebellion
is unjustifiable
except
when the
safety of the subjects
is
threatened
by the sovereign ,
for it was
self-preservation
that
induced
men to
associate ,
and
rebellion would only restore
the anarchy
and
insecurity
of the
state
of nature .
Reason
may
perhaps
discover
principles
by
which commonwealths
may be made everlasting .
The sovereign
,
Hobbes
strongly
insists , must
regulate
ecclesiastical
as well
as
civil affairs , and determine
what doctrines
are conducive
to peace ;
otherwise
the
subjects ' allegiance will
be divided, and the State
will suffer dissolution
.
Thus Hobbes upheld
a clear and valid doctrine
of sovereignty
,
while
retaining
the fiction of a social
contract
to generate
the
sovereign .
He
borrowed
the
sovereign's
absolutism
from the
patriarchal
theory , but
rejected
that
theory of the foundation of
political society .
Hobbes affirmed that " the validity of covenants
begins not but with the
constitution
of a civil
power
sufficient
to
compel
men to keep them " ; and yet , inconsistently
with this , he
bases the obligatoriness
of the covenant
by which the sovereign is
established
on a law of nature which enjoins
" that
men perform
their
covenants
made ," or
else
they
remain
in
a state of war.
Hobbes does not suggest that the social contract
is historical
; he
appears to have believed
that States
had their natural
beginning
in conquest or in families
gradually
aggrandised
by the acquisition
of servants , but , being
concerned
with
rational
explanation , he
supposes
them
to have
been
based
on some kind of voluntary
contract .*
* Croom Robertson , Hobbes , p . 146.


Introduction .
19
C
a
-e
t
Spinoza (see especially
Tractatus
Politicus, 1677 ) regarded
men
as originally having
equal
rights
over all things , and the
state of
nature as a state of war .
He identified natural
right with natural
power .
Men , led by their reason , freely combined
their
private
forces to establish civil government , by which means they attained
their ends- peace and security .
The right of the supreme
magis-
trate is the sum of the collective
rights or powers of the citizens
;
and as their rights
were
absolute , the
power of the State
is also
absolute .
When the sovereign
loses
his
superior
power , he loses
his superior right.
In Hobbes the covenant
is supposed
to
give
a supreme
right to the sovereign
apart
from
his
actual
power ;
but if power and right are identical , Spinoza's
conclusion
is more
logical.
Puffendorf ( The Law of Nature and ofNations, 1672 ) held with
Grotius that men are naturally
sociable
and
inclined to family
life , which is the
primary
form
of society .
Experience
of the
injuries that one
man
can
inflict
on
another
leads up to civil
government , which is
constituted
(1) by
a
unanimous
mutual
covenant
of a number
of men to institute
a commonwealth
and
be bound by the decisions
of the majority , all dissentients
retain-
ing their natural
liberty ;
( 2) by a resolution
of the majority
that
certain
rulers
shall
be placed
in authority
;
( 3) by
a
covenant
between the government
and the subjects
that
the
former
shall
rule for the common
good , and that the latter
shall faithfully
obey
lawful commands
.
The
State , when
duly constituted
, may be
regarded
as one person having
a single will represented
by that of
the sovereign , wherever
the sovereignty
may be placed .
In 1680 appeared
Filmer's Patriarcha , a feeble
and
rambling
tractate in defence of "the right divine of kings
to govern wrong ."
Filmer traced the origin of political power
to Adam , who derived
his royal authority
from the
rights
of fatherhood
and
property
conferred
by God .
Adam
having
transmitted
his
absolute
and
arbitrary
power
through
the
patriarchs
to each
succeeding
gene-
¡ ration, civil
power in general
is by divine institution and
cannot
be limited.
The existing
rights of princes
are derived
from Noah
and his children , of whom
they are deemed the heirs even though
they hold their titles
unjustly.
The
stress Filmer

BOOK IV.
CHAPTER
I.
THAT THE GENERAL WILL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE .
So long as a number of men in combination are considered
as
a single body , they have but one will, which relates to the common
preservation
and to the
general
well -being .
In such a case all
the forces of the State are vigorous
and simple , and its principles
are clear and luminous
; it has no confused
and conflicting
inter-
ests ; the common
good is everywhere
plainly manifest
and only
good sense is required
to perceive
it.
Peace , union , and
equality
are foes to political subtleties .
Upright and
simple -minded
men
are hard to deceive
because of their simplicity ; allurements
and
refined pretexts
do not impose
upon
them ; they are not even
cunning
enough
to be dupes .
When, in the
happiest
nation in
the world, we see troops of peasants
regulating
the affairs of the
State under an oak and always
acting wisely , can we refrain
from
despising
the refinements
of other
nations , who
make themselves
illustrious and wretched
with so much
art and mystery ?
A State thus
governed
needs very few laws ; and in so far as it
becomes
necessary
to
promulgate
new ones, this
necessity
is
universally
recognized .
The
first
man
to
propose
them
only
gives
expression
to what
all have
previously
felt ,
and
neither
factions
nor eloquence
will be needed
to pass into law what every
one has already
resolved
to do , so soon as he is sure that the rest
will act as he does .
What deceives reasoners is that , seeing only States that
are ill-
constituted
from the beginning , they are impressed
with the im-
possibility of maintaining
such
a policy in those
States ; they
laugh to think
of all the follies
to which a cunning
knave , an
insinuating speaker , can persuade
the people of Paris or London .
They know not that Cromwell would have
been
put in irons by
the people of Berne , and the Duke of Beaufort
imprisoned
by the
Genevese.2
But when the social
bond begins
to be relaxed
and the State
197

The Social Contract .
weakened , when
private
interests
begin to make themselves
felt
and
small
associations
to
exercise
influence
on the State,
the
common
interest
is
injuriously affected
and
finds
adversaries ;
unanimity
no longer reigns in the voting ; the general will is no
longer the will of all ; 3 opposition
and
disputes
arise, and the
best counsel
does not pass uncontested .
Lastly, when the State , on the verge of ruin , no longer
subsists
except in a vain and illusory
form , when the social bond is broken
in all hearts , when
the basest interest
shelters itself impudently
under the sacred
name of the
public
welfare , the general will
becomes
dumb ; all,
under
the guidance
of secret
motives , no
more express their opinions as citizens
than if the State had never
existed ; and , under
the
name
of laws , they
deceitfully
pass
unjust decrees which have only private
interest
as their end .
Does it follow from
this that the general
will is destroyed
or
corrupted
?
No ;
it is always
constant , unalterable , and
pure ;
but it is subordinated
to others which get the better of it.
Each ,
detaching
his own interest from the common
interest , sees clearly
that he cannot
completely
separate it ; but his share in the injury
done to the State
appears to him as nothing in comparison
with
the exclusive advantage which
he aims at appropriating
to himself.
This particular
advantage
being
excepted , he
desires
the general
welfare for his own interests
quite as strongly
as any other .
Even
in selling his vote for money , he does not extinguish in himself the
general will, but eludes it.4
The fault that he commits is to change
the state of the question , and to answer
something
different from
what
he was asked ; so that , instead
of saying by a vote : "It is
beneficial
to the State ," he says :
It is beneficial
to a certain man
or a certain
party that such or such a motion
should pass."
Thus
the law of public order in assemblies
is not so much to maintain
in them the general will
as to ensure
that it shall always be con-
sulted and always respond .
I might in this place make many reflections
on the simple right
of voting in every act of sovereignty -a right which nothing can
take away from the citizens- and on that of speaking , proposing,
dividing , and
discussing , which the
government
is
always
very
careful
to leave to
its
members
only
;
but this important matter
would require
a
separate
treatise
,
and
I
cannot
say everything
in
this one
.


CHAPTER II .
VOTING .
WE see from
the previous , chapter
that the
manner
in which
public
affairs
are
managed
may
give
a sufficiently
trustworthy
indication of the character
and health of the body politic.
The
more that
harmony
reigns in the
assemblies , that
is, the more
the voting approaches
unanimity,
the
more
also
is the general
will predominant
; but long discussions ,5 dissensions , and uproar
proclaim the ascendency
of private interests
and
the
decline
of
the State .
This is not so clearly apparent
when two or more
orders
enter
into its
constitution
, as, in Rome, the
patricians
and
plebeians ,
whose
quarrels
often
disturbed
the comitia , even in the palmiest
days of the Republic
; but this
exception
is more
apparent
than
real, for, at that time , by a vice inherent
in the body politic, there
were , so to speak , two States in one ; what is not true of the two
together
is true
of each
separately .
And , indeed , even in the
most stormy times , the plebiscita
of the
people , when the
Senate
did not interfere
with them , always
passed
peaceably
and by a
large majority of votes ; the citizens
having
but
one interest , the
people
had but one will.
At the other extremity
of the circle unanimity
returns
; that is,
when the citizens , fallen into slavery , have no longer either liberty
or will .
Then
fear
and
flattery change
votes into acclamations
;
men no longer
deliberate , but adore or curse .
Such was the dis-
graceful
mode
of speaking
in the
Senate
under
the
Emperors
.
Sometimes
it
was
done
with ridiculous precautions .
Tacitus 7
observes that under Otho the senators , in
overwhelming
Vitellius
with execrations , affected
to
make
at the same time a frightful
noise , in order that , if he happened
to become
master , he might
not know what each of them had said .
From these different
considerations
are deduced
the principles
by which we should
regulate the
method of counting
votes and of
comparing
opinions, according
as the general will is more or less
easy to ascertain
and the State more or less degenerate .
199


200
The Social Contract .
There is but one law which by its
nature requires
unanimous
consent , that is, the
social
compact
; for civil association
is the
most voluntary act in the world ;
every man being born free and
master of himself , no one can , under
any pretext whatever , enslave
.
him without
his assent .
To decide that the son of a slave is born
a slave is to decide that he is not born a man .
If, then , at the time of the social compact , there are opponents
of it, their opposition
does
not invalidate
the contract , but only
prevents
them
from being
included in it ;
they
are
foreigners
among citizens .
When
the
State
is established , consent
lies in
residence
; to dwell in the
territory
is to
submit
to the sover-
eignty .*8
Excepting this
original
contract ,
the
vote
of the
majority
always binds all the rest, this being a result of the contract
itself.
But it will be asked how a man can be free and yet forced
to con-
form to wills which are not his own .
How are
opponents free
and yet subject
to laws they have not consented to ?
I reply that the question
is wrongly
put .
The
citizen consents
to all the
laws , even to those
which are passed in spite of him,
and even to those which punish
him when he dares to violate any
of them .
The unvarying
will of all the members of the State
is
the general
will ; it is through
that that they are
citizens
and
free .†
When a law is proposed
in the assembly of the people,
what
is asked
of them is not exactly whether
they approve the
proposition or reject
it, but
whether
it is conformable
or not to
the general will , which is their own ;
each one in giving
his vote
expresses his opinion thereupon
;
and from the counting of the
votes is
obtained
the
declaration
of the general
will .
When ,
therefore , the
opinion
opposed
to my own
prevails , that simply
shows that I was mistaken , and that what I considered
to be the
general
will
was
not so.
Had my private
opinion prevailed, I
* This must always
be understood
to relate to a free State ; for
otherwise family , property , want of an asylum , necessity, or violence ,
may detain
an inhabitant
in a country against his will ;
and then
his
residence alone no longer supposes his consent to the contract or to
the violation of it.
+ At
Genoa
we read in front of the prisons and on the fetters of
the galley -slaves the word , Libertas .
This employment of the device
is becoming
and just .
In reality , it is only the
malefactors
of
all
degrees who prevent the citizen from being free
.
In
a
country where
all such people are
in
the galleys

perfect

should
have
done
something
other than I wished
;
and in that
case I should
not have been free.9
This supposes , it is true , that
all the marks of the general will 10
are still in the majority ; when they cease to be so, whatever
side
we take, there is no longer any liberty.
In showing
before 11 how particular
wills were
substituted
for
general wills in public resolutions , I have sufficiently
indicated
the
means practicable
for
preventing
this abuse ; I will speak of it
again
hereafter.12
With
regard
to the proportional number of
votes for declaring
this will , I have
also laid down the principles
according to which it may be determined.13
The
difference
of
a single
vote
destroys
unanimity
; but
between
unanimity and
equality there are
many unequal divisions, at each of which this
number can be fixed according
to the condition and requirements
of the body politic .
Two general
principles
may serve to regulate these proportions
:
the one, that the more important
and weighty the resolutions , the
nearer should the opinion which prevails
approach
unanimity ;
the
other , that the greater the
despatch
requisite
in the matter
under
discussion , the more
should
we
restrict
the
prescribed
difference
in the division of opinions
; in resolutions
which must
be come to immediately
the majority of a
single
vote
should
suffice .
The
first of these
principles
appears
more suitable
to
laws, the
second
to affairs .
Be that as it may , it is by their
combination
that
are
established
the
best
proportions
which
can be assigned for the decision of a majority.


CHAPTER III.
ELECTIONS.
WITH
regard to the
elections
of the Prince and the magistrates ,
which are, as I have
said , complex
acts, there
are two modes
of
procedure , viz. choice
and lot.¹4
Both
have
been
employed in
different
republics , and a very complicated
mixture of the two is
seen even now in the election
of the Doge of Venice .
"Election
by lot,"
says
Montesquieu
,15 " is of the nature
of
democracy ." I agree , but how is it so ?
" The lot," he continues ,
" is a mode of election
which mortifies
no one ; it leaves
every
citizen a reasonable
hope of serving his country ."
But these
are
not the reasons .
If we are mindful
that the election of the chiefs is a function of
government
and not of sovereignty , we
shall
see why the method
of election
by lot is more in the nature of democracy , in
which
the
administration
is by so much the
better as its
acts are
less
multiplied .
In every true democracy , the
magistracy is not a boon but an
onerous charge , which cannot fairly be imposed on one individual
rather than on another .
The law alone
can
impose this burden
on the person upon whom the lot falls.
For then , the conditions
being equal
for all, and
the choice
not being
dependent
on any
human will , there is no particular
application
to alter the univer-
sality ofthe law.
In an aristocracy
the Prince chooses the Prince, the government
is maintained
by itself , and voting
is rightly
established .
The instance
of the
election
of the Doge of Venice, far from
destroying
this
distinction
, confirms
it ; this
composite
form is
suitable in a mixed government .
For it is an error to
take the
government
of Venice as a true aristocracy.16
If the people
have
no share in the government , the nobles
themselves
are numerous .
A multitude
of poor
Barnabotes
never come
near any magistracy ,
and have for their nobility only the empty title of Excellency and
the right to attend the Great Council .
This Great Council being
as
numerous

no
more
privileges
than
our
simple
citizens
(citoyens).
It
is
certain
that , setting aside the extreme disparity
of the
two Republics , the
burgesses (la
bourgeoisie ) of Geneva
exactly
correspond
to the Venetian
order
of
patricians
;
our
natives
(natifs ) and residents
(habitants ) represent the citizens and
people of Venice ;
our peasants
( paysans ) represent
the subjects
of the
mainland
;
in
short , in whatever
way we
consider
this
Republic
apart from
its
size
,
its government
is
no more aristocratic
than ours
.
The
whole
difference
is
that
,
having
no chief for life
,
we have not the same need for election
by lot
.
Elections by lot would have few drawbacks
in
a
true democracy
,

CHAPTER IV .
THE ROMAN COMITIA .
We have no very trustworthy
records
of the early times of Rome ;
there is even great probability that most of the things which have
been handed
down are fables ,* and , in general , the most
instruc-
tive
part of the
annals
of nations , which
is the history
of their
institution, is the
most defective .
Experience
every day teaches
us
from
what
causes
spring the revolutions
of empires
;
but,
as
nations
are no longer
in
process of formation
, we
have
scarcely
anything
but conjectures
to explain how they have been formed.20
The
customs
which are
found
established
at least testify
that
these customs had a beginning .
Of the traditions
that go back to
these
origins , those
which the
greatest
authorities
countenance
,
and which the strongest
reasons
confirm , ought
to pass
as the
most undoubted
.
These are the principles which I have tried to
follow in enquiring
how the
freest and most powerful
nation
in
the world exercised
its supreme power.
After the foundation
of Rome, the growing
republic , that is, the
army ofthe founder , composed
of Albans, Sabines , and foreigners ,
was divided into three classes , which , from
this division , took the
name
of tribes .
Each of these
tribes
was
subdivided
into ten
curia , and
each
curia into
decuria , at the head
of which were
placed curiones and decuriones
.
Besides
this ,
a body of one
hundred
horsemen
or
knights,
called a centuria , was drawn
from
each tribe , whence
we see that
these
divisions , not
very necessary
in a town , were
at first only
military.
But it seems that an instinct
of greatness induced
the
little town of Rome from the first to adopt a polity suitable
to the
capital
of the world.
From this first
division
an
inconvenience
soon
resulted ; the
The name of Rome , which is alleged to be derived from Romulus ,
is Greek
and means force ; the name of Numa is also
Greek and
means law.
What likelihood
is there that the first two kings of that
city should have borne at the outset names so clearly related to what
they did ?

tribe of the Albans * and that of the Sabines †
remaining
always
in the
same
condition
, while
that of the
foreigners
increased
continually through
perpetual
accessions , the
last
soon
outnum-
bered the two others .
The remedy which Servius found
for this
dangerous
abuse
was to
change the
mode
of division , and for
the division
by races , which
he
abolished , to substitute
another
derived from the
districts
of the
city
occupied
by each tribe.
Instead of three tribes he made four , each of which occupied one
of the hills of Rome and bore its name .
Thus, in remedying
the
existing inequality, he also
prevented
it for the future
;
and in
order that
this might
be a division , not only of localities , but of
men, he prohibited the inhabitants
of one quarter from removing
into another , which prevented
the races from being mingled .
He also doubled
the
three old centuriæ of cavalry
and added
twelve
others to them, but still under the old names-a simple
and judicious
means
by which he effected a distinction
between
the body of knights
and that of the people , without
making
the
latter murmur .
To these four urban
tribes
Servius
added
fifteen
others , called
rural
tribes ,
because
they
were
formed
of inhabitants
of the
country,
divided
into
so many
cantons .
Afterwards
as many
new ones were
formed
; and
the Roman people
were
at length
divided
into thirty-five
tribes ,
a
number
which
remained
fixed
until the close of the Republic .
From
this distinction
between
the urban
and the
rural tribes
resulted
an
effect
worthy
of notice , because
there
is no
other
instance of it, and because Rome owed to it both the preservation
of
her manners
and the growth
of her empire . It might be
supposed that the urban
tribes soon
arrogated
to themselves the
power and the
honours , and were
ready
to
disparage
the rural
tribes.
It
was quite the reverse .
We know the taste of the old
Romans for a country life.
This
taste they derived
from
their
wise founder, who
united
with liberty rural and
military works ,
and
relegated ,
so to speak , to
the
towns
arts , trades ,
intrigue ,
wealth , and slavery .
Thus every eminent
man that Rome had being a dweller
in the
fields
and
a tiller of the soil, it
was
customary
to
seek in the
country only for the
defenders of the Republic .
This condition,
being that of the worthiest
patricians , was honoured
by every one ;
the simple and laborious
life of villagers
was
preferred
to the

The Social Contract .
lax and indolent life of the burgesses of Rome ; and
many who
would have been only wretched
proletarians
in the city became ,
as labourers
in the
fields , respected
citizens .
It is not without
reason , said Varro , that
our high -minded
ancestors
established
in
the village
the nursery
of those
hardy
and
valiant men
who
defended
them in time of war
and
sustained
them
in time of
peace .
Pliny says positively
that the rural tribes were honoured
because
of the
men that
composed
them ,
while
the
worthless
whom it was desired
to
disgrace
were
transferred
as a mark of
ignominy into
the
urban
tribes .
The Sabine
Appius Claudius ,
having
come to settle in Rome, was there
loaded
with honours
and enrolled in a rural
tribe , which afterwards
took the name of
his
family .
Lastly, all the freedmen
entered
the urban tribes ,
never the rural
; and during
the whole of the Republic there is not
a single example of any of these
freedmen
attaining
a magistracy ,
although
they had become
citizens .
This
maxim
was
excellent ,
but
was
pushed
so far that
at
length
a change , and
certainly
an abuse , in government , resulted
from it.
First, the censors ,
after
having
long
arrogated
the
right
of
transferring
citizens arbitrarily from one tribe to another , allowed
the majority to
be
enrolled in whichever
they pleased-a per
mission which certainly
was in no way advantageous , and took
away
one
of
the
great
resources
of the
censorship .
Further ,
since the great and
powerful
all enrolled
themselves
in the rural
tribes ,
while
the
freedmen
who
had
become
citizens
remained
with the populace
in the urban
ones , the tribes in general had no
longer any district
or territory , but all were
so intermingled
that
it was impossible
to distinguish
the members
of each
except
by
the registers ; so that the
idea of the word tribe passed thus from
the real to the personal , or rather became almost a chimera .
Moreover, it came
about
that
the urban
tribes , being
close
at
hand , were often the most
powerful
in the comitia , and
sold
the
State to those who stooped
to buy the votes of the mob of which
they were composed .
With
regard
to the curia , the founder having
formed
ten in
each tribe , the whole Roman people , at that time enclosed in the
walls of the city , consisted of thirty curia , each of which had its
temples , its
gods ,
its
officers
,
its
priests
,
and
its
festivals
called
compitalia
,
resembling
the paganalia
which the rural
tribes
had
afterwards
.
In the new division
of
Servius

number

207
touch
them ;
and
the
curia ,
being
independent
of the tribes ,
became
another division of the
inhabitants
of Rome.
But there
11 was no
question
of curia
either
in the rural
tribes
or in the
people composing
them,
because the
tribes
having
become
a
purely civil institution, and another
mode of levying troops having
been introduced
, the
military divisions
of Romulus were found
superfluous .
Thus , although
every citizen
was enrolled in a tribe ,
it was far from
being the case that each was enrolled
in a curia.
Servius made yet a third division , which had no relation
to the
two preceding , but
became
by
its
effects the most important
of
all
.
He distributed
the
whole
Roman
people
into six classes
,
which he distinguished
,
not by the place
of
residence
,
nor by the
men
,
but by property
;
so
that
the
first
classes
were
filled with
rich men
,
the last with poor men
,
and the intermediate
ones with
those who enjoyed
a
moderate
fortune
.
These six
classes
were
subdivided into one hundred
and ninety
-
three other bodies called
centuriæ
,
and these bodies
were
so
distributed
that the first class
alone comprised
more than
a
half
,
and the last
formed
only one
.
It
thus happened
that the class least
numerous
in
men had
most
centuria
,
and that
the last
entire class
was
counted
as
only one
subdivision
,
although
it
alone
contained
more than
a
half
of
the
inhabitants of Rome
.
In order that the people might not
so
clearly
discern the
conse-
quences
of
this
last
form
,
Servius
affected
to
give
it
a
military
aspect
.
He introduced in the
second
class
two
centuria
of
armourers
,
and
two
of
makers
of instruments
of war
in
the
fourth
;
in
each class
,
except the last
,
he distinguished
the young
and the old
,
that
is
to
say
,
those
who were obliged
to
bear arms
,
and those
who
were
exempted
by law on
account
of
age
-
a
distinction
which
,
more
than that
of
property
,
gave
rise
to the
necessity of frequently
repeating the census
or
enumeration
;
finally
,
he required that
the
assembly
should
be
held
in
the
Campus
Martius
,
and that all who were qualified
for service by age should
gather there with their arms
.
The reason why he did not follow
in
the last
class this same
division into seniors
and
juniors
is,
that
the honour
of
bearing
arms for their country
was not
granted
to
the
populace
of
which
it
was composed
;
it
was
necessary
to
have
homes
in
order
to
obtain the right
of
defending
them
;
and out of those innumerable
troops
of
beggars with which
the armies
of
kings nowadays
glitter
,
there
is
perhaps
not one but would have
been
driven
with scorn
from
a
Roman cohort when soldiers
were defenders of liberty
.
Yet again
,
there was
in
the last
class
a
distinction between the

208

proletarii and those
who
were
called
capite
censi .
The former
not altogether
destitute , at
least
supplied
citizens
to the
State ,
sometimes
even soldiers
in pressing need .
As for those who had
nothing
at all
and
could
only be
counted
by heads , they
were
regarded
as altogether unimportant
, and Marius was the first who
condescended
to enrol them .
Without deciding here whether this third enumeration
was good
or bad in itself , I think I may affirm
that nothing
but the simple
manners of the early Romans -their disinterestedness , their taste
for agriculture , their contempt
for commerce
and for the ardent
pursuit
of gain-could
have
rendered
it
practicable .
In
what
modern
nation
would rapacious
greed , restlessness of spirit , in,
trigue , continual
changes of residence , and the perpetual revolutions
of fortune
have
allowed
such
an institution
to endure for twenty
years
without
the
whole
State
being
subverted ?
It is , indeed,
necessary to
observe
carefully
that
morality
and the censorship,
more powerful
than this institution
, corrected
its imperfections in
Rome , and that
many a rich man
was relegated
to the
class of
the poor for making
too much display of his wealth .
From all this we may easily understand
why mention is scarcely
ever made of more than five
classes, although
there
were
really
six .
The sixth , which furnished
neither
soldiers
to the army, nor
voters to the Campus
Martius * and which was almost
useless in
the Republic , rarely
counted
as anything .
Such were the different
divisions
of the Roman
people .
Let
us see now what effect they produced
in the assemblies .
These
assemblies , lawfully convened , were
called
comitia ;
they
were
usually held in the Forum of Rome or in the
Campus Martius,
and were distinguished
as comitia
curiata , comitia centuriata , and
comitia tributa , in accordance
with that one of the three forms by
which they were regulated .
The comitia curiata
were founded by
Romulus, the comitia centuriata by Servius , and the comitia tributa
by the tribunes
of the
people .
No law received
sanction , no
magistrate was elected , except in the comitia ; and as there was no
citizen who was not enrolled
in a curia, in a centuria , or in a tribe ,
it follows
that
no
citizen
was
excluded
from the right of voting,
and that the Roman people
were truly sovereign
de jure and de
facto .
* I say, "to the
Campus Martius," because it was there that the
comitia
centuriata
assembled ;
in the two other
forms the
people
assembled in the Forum or elsewhere ; and then the capite
censi
had
as much influence and authority as the chief citizens.


The Roman
Comitia .
209
1:
In order that the comitia
might be lawfully
assembled , and that
what
was
done
in them
might
have the
force
of law , three
conditions
were necessary : the first , that the
body or magistrate
which
convoked
them should
be
invested
with the
necessary
authority for that purpose
; the second , that
the
assembly should
be held on one of the days permitted
by law ; the third, that
the
auguries should
be favourable .
The reason for the first regulation
need not be explained
; the
second is a matter
of police
; thus it was not permitted
to hold
the comitia
on feast
days
and
market
days ,
when
the
country
people, coming
to Rome on business , had
no
leisure to pass the
day in the place
of assembly .
By the third, the
Senate kept
in
check a proud and turbulent
people , and seasonably
tempered
the
ardour of seditious
tribunes
;
but
the
latter found more than one
means of freeing themselves
from this constraint .
Laws
and the
election
of
chiefs
were
not the only points
submitted for the decision
of the comitia ; the Roman
people
having usurped
the most important
functions
of government , the
fate of Europe may
be
said
to have
been
determined
in
their
assemblies .
This variety of subjects
gave scope for the different
forms which these assemblies took according
to the matters which
had to be decided .
To judge of these
different
forms , it is
sufficient
to
compare
them .
Romulus, in instituting
the curia , desired
to restrain
the
Senate by means of the people , and the people
by means of the
Senate ,
while
ruling
equally
over
all.
He therefore
gave the
people by this form
all the
authority
of numbers
in
order
to
balance that of power and wealth , which
he left
to the patricians .
But, according to the spirit of a monarchy
, he
left
still more
advantage
to the patricians
through the influence
of their
clients.
in
securing
a plurality of votes .
This
admirable
institution of
patrons and clients
was
a
masterpiece
of policy and
humanity ,
without which the
patrician
order , so opposed
to the spirit of a
republic , could
not have
subsisted .
Rome alone
has
had the
honour of giving
to the world such
a fine institution
, from which
there never
resulted
any
abuse , and
which
notwithstanding
has
never been followed.21
Since the form
of the
assembly
of the curia
subsisted
under
the kings down to Servius , and since the reign of the last Tarquin
is not considered
legitimate , the royal laws
were on this account
generally distinguished
by the name of leges curiatæ .
Under the Republic
the assembly
of the curie , always

lace , did
not
correspond
either
with the Senate , which
was at
the head of the patricians , or with the tribunes , who, although
plebeians ,
were
at the head
of
the middle-class
citizens.
It
therefore
fell into disrepute
; and
its
degradation
was
such
that
its thirty assembled
lictors
did what the
comitia curiata ought to
have done .
The comitia centuriata
was so favourable
to the aristocracy
that
we do not at first
see
why the Senate did not
always prevail in
the
comitia
which
bore that
name , and by which the
consuls ,
censors , and
other curule
magistrates
were
elected .
Indeed , of
the one hundred
and ninety -three centuria
which formed
the six
classes of the whole
Roman
people , the
first
class comprising
ninety -eight , and
the votes
being
counted
only by centuriæ , this
first class alone outnumbered
in votes all the others .
When all
these centuria were in agreement , the recording
of votes was even
discontinued
; what the minority had decided
passed for a decision
of the multitude
; and
we may say that in the
comitia
centuriata
affairs
were
regulated
rather
by the
majority of
crowns
(écus)
than of votes .
But this excessive
power
was moderated
in
two
ways : first ,
the tribunes
usually ,
and
a great
number
of plebeians
always ,
being in the class of the rich , balanced
the
influence
of the patri-
cians in this first
class .
The second
means consisted
in this , that
instead of making
the centuriæ vote according
to their order , which
would
have caused
the first class to begin
always , one of them *
was drawn by lot and proceeded
alone to the election
; after which
all the centuriæ, being
summoned
on another
day according to
their rank , renewed the election
and usually
confirmed
it. (Thus
the power of example
was taken
away from
rank to
be given to
lot, according
to the principle
of democracy .
From this
practice
resulted
yet
another
advantage
;
the
citi-
zens
from the country
had
time , between
the
two
elections , to
gain information
about
the
merits of the
candidate
provisionally
chosen , and
so
record
their
votes with knowledge
of the case .
But, under pretence of despatch , this practice came to be abolished
and the two elections
took place on the same day .
The comitia
tributa
were
properly
the
council of the Roman
people .
They were convoked
only by the tribunes
; in them the
tribunes
were elected and
passed
their plebiscita .
Not
only had
the Senate no status in them- it had not
even a right to attend
;
* This centuria , thus chosen by lot , was called prærogativa , because
its suffrage was demanded first ; hence came the word prerogative .


The Roman
Comitia .
2II
and , being compelled
to
obey laws on which they could
not vote ,
the
senators
were , in this
respect ,
less
free than the
meanest
citizens .
This
injustice
was
altogether
impolitic ,
and
alone
sufficed to
invalidate
the
decrees
of a body to which all
the
citizens were not
admitted .
If all the patricians
had
taken
part
in these comitia according
to the rights which they had as citizens ,
having become in that case simple
individuals
, they would have
scarcely influenced
a form in which votes
were
counted
by the
head , and in which the meanest proletarian
had as much power as
the Chief of the Senate .
We see, then, that besides the order which resulted
from these
different
divisions
for the collection
of the
votes
of so great
a
people, these divisions
were
not
reduced
to forms immaterial
in
themselves , but that each
had results corresponding
with the pur-
poses for which it was chosen .
Without
entering
upon
this in greater
detail , it
follows
from
the
preceding
explanations
that
the
comitia
tributa
were
more
favourable to popular government
, and
the
comitia centuriata
to
aristocracy
.
With
regard
to the
comitia
curiata , in
which
the
Roman populace
alone formed
the majority, as they served
only
to favour tyranny
and
evil
designs , they deserved
to fall into
discredit, the seditious
themselves
refraining
from a means which
would too plainly reveal their projects .
It is certain that the full
majesty
of the Roman
people
was found only in the
comitia
centuriata , which were alone
complete , seeing that the rural
tribes
were absent
from the comitia
curiata and
the
Senate
and the
patricians
from
the comitia tributa .
22 The
mode of collecting
the votes among the early
Romans
was as simple
as their manners , although
still less simple than
in
Sparta.
Each gave his vote with a loud voice , and
a recording
officer duly registered
it ; a majority of votes in each tribe deter-
mined the suffrage of the tribe ;
a majority of votes
among the
tribes determined
the
suffrage
of the
people ;
and
so with the
curiæ and centuriæ.
This was a good practice
so long as probity
prevailed
among
the
citizens
and
every
one
was
ashamed
to
record his vote
publicly for an unjust measure or an unworthy
man ; but when the people were corrupted
and votes were bought ,
it was expedient
that
they
should
be
given
secretly in order
to
restrain purchasers
by distrust
and
give knaves an opportunity
of
not being traitors .
I know that Cicero blames this change
and
attributes
to it in
part the fall of the
Republic .
But although
I
feel the weight
which
Cicero's
authority
ought
to
have in this matter , I cannot


212
The Social Contract .
adopt
his opinion ;
on
the
contrary , I think
that
through
not
making
sufficient
changes of this kind, the downfall of the
State
was hastened .
As the
regimen
of healthy
persons
is unfit for
invalids , so we should
not
desire to govern
a corrupt people by
the laws which suit a good
nation .
Nothing supports
this maxim
better
than the
duration
of the
republic
of Venice,
only
the
semblance of which now exists , solely because its laws are suitable
to none but worthless
men .
Tablets, therefore , were
distributed
to the citizens by means of
which each could
vote without his
decision
being
known ; new
formalities
were
also
established
for the
collection
of tablets ,
the counting
of votes , the comparison
of numbers , etc.; but this
did
not
prevent
suspicions
as to the fidelity of the
officers *
charged
with these
duties .
At length
edicts
were
framed , the
multitude
of which proves their uselessness .
Towards the closing
years , they were
often compelled
to resort
to extraordinary
expedients in order to supply
the defects
of the
laws .
Sometimes
prodigies
were feigned
; but this method , which
might impose on the people , did not impose on those who governed
them .
Sometimes
an assembly
was hastily
summoned
before
the
candidates
had had
time to canvass .
Sometimes
a whole sitting
was consumed in talking
when it was seen that the people
having
been won over were ready to pass a bad
resolution .
But at last
ambition
evaded everything
; and
it seems incredible
that
in the
midst
of so
many
abuses , this
great
nation , by favour of
its
ancient
institutions
,
did not cease
to
elect
magistrates
,
to
pass
laws
,
to
judge causes
,
and
to
despatch
public
and
private
affairs
with almost
as
much facility
as
the Senate itself could
have done
.

CHAPTER
V.
THE TRIBUNESHIP.23
WHEN an
exact
relation
cannot
be established
among
the
con-
stituent
parts of the State , or
when
indestructible
causes
are
incessantly changing
their
relations , a special
magistracy is insti-
tuted , which is not incorporated
with the others , but which replaces
each term
in its
true
relation , forming
a
connexion
or
middle
term
either
between the Prince and the
people , or between
the
Prince and the sovereign , or if necessary between both at once .
This body, which I shall
call the tribuneship , is the guardian of
the laws
and
of the legislative
power .
It sometimes
serves to
protect the sovereign
against the government , as the tribunes
of
the people did in Rome ; sometimes to support
the government
against
the people , as the Council of Ten
now does
in Venice ;
and sometimes
to maintain
an equilibrium among all parts , as the
ephors did in Sparta .
The tribuneship
is
not
a
constituent
part
of the
State ,
and
should have no share in the legislative
or in the executive power ;
but it is in this very circumstance
that
its
own
power
is
greatest
;
for
,
while unable
to
do anything
,
it
can prevent
everything
.
It
is
more sacred and
more venerated
,
as
defender
of
the
laws
,
than
the Prince that executes them and the sovereign
that enacts them
.
This was very clearly seen
in
Rome
,
when
those proud
patricians
,
who always despised
the people
as
a
whole
,
were
forced
to
bow
before
a
simple
officer
of
the people
,
who
had
neither
auspices
nor jurisdiction
.
The tribuneship
,
wisely moderated
,
is
the strongest
support
of
a
good
constitution
;
but
if
its power
be
ever
so
little
in
excess
,
it
overthrows
everything
.
Weakness
is
not natural
to
it;
and
provided
it
has some power
,
it
is
never less than
it
should be
.
It
degenerates
into
tyranny
when
it
usurps
the
executive
power
,
of
which
it
is
only the moderator
,
and
when
it
wishes
to
make the laws which
it
should
only defend
.
The enormous
power
of the
ephors
,
which was without
danger
so
long
as
Sparta pre-
served
her morality
,
accelerated
the corruption
when
it
had begun
.
213

214
The Social Contract.
The blood of Agis, slain
by these
tyrants , was
avenged
by his
successor ;
but
the
crime
and
the punishment
of the
ephors
alike hastened the fall of the republic , and , after Cleomenes
, Sparta
was
no longer of any
account .
Rome, again , perished
in the
same way ; and the excessive power of the
tribunes , usurped by
degrees , served at last , with the aid
of laws framed
on behalf of
liberty, as a shield
for the emperors who
destroyed
her.
As for
the Council of Ten in Venice , it is a tribunal of blood , horrible
both to the patricians
and to the people ; and , far from
resolutely
defending
the laws , it has only served
since their degradation
for
striking
secret blows which men dare not remark .
The tribuneship
,
like the
government , is weakened
by the
multiplication
of its members .
When the tribunes of the Roman
people , at
first
two
in
number
and
afterwards
five , wished to
double this number , the Senate
allowed
them
to do so , being
quite sure of controlling some by means of others , which did not
fail to happen .
The
best
means
of preventing
the
usurpations
of such
a for-
midable
body , a means
of
which no government
has
hitherto
availed itself, would
be, not to make this body permanent , but to
fix intervals
during which it should
remain
suspended .
These
intervals , which
should
not
be long enough to allow abuses time
to
become
established ,
can
be fixed
by law in
such
a manner
that it may be easy to shorten
them in case of need by means
of
extraordinary
commissions .
This method
appears to me free from
objection, because , as I
have said , the tribuneship
, forming no part of the constitution
, can
be removed
without
detriment
; and it seems to me efficacious ,
because
a magistrate
newly
established
does not start
with the
power that his predecessor
had , but with that which the law gives
him.


CHAPTER VI .
THE DICTATORSHIP .
THE
inflexibility of the laws , which prevents
them
from being
adapted
to emergencies , may in certain
cases render
them
perni-
cious , and thereby
cause the ruin of the State in a time
of crisis .
The order and
tardiness
of the
forms
require
a space
of time
which circumstances
sometimes
do not allow .
A thousand cases
may arise for which the legislator
has not provided, and
to per-
ceive that everything
cannot
be foreseen is a very needful kind of
foresight .
We must therefore
not
desire
to
establish
political institutions
so firmly as to take
away the
power
of suspending
their
effects .
Even Sparta allowed
her laws to sleep .
But only the greatest
dangers
can
outweigh
that
of changing
the public order , and the sacred power of the laws should
never be
interfered with
except when
the
safety of the country
is at stake .
In these rare and obvious
cases , the public security is provided
for
by a special
act, which
entrusts
the care of it to the
most worthy
man .
This
commission
can be conferred
in two ways , according
to the nature of the danger .
If an
increase
in the activity
of the government
suffices
to
remedy this evil,
we
may
concentrate
it in
one
or two of its
members
; in that case it is not the authority
of the laws which is
changed
but only the form
of their administration
.
But if the
danger is such that the formal
process of law is an obstacle
to our
security , a supreme
head is
nominated
, who
may silence
all the
laws
and
suspend
for a moment
the sovereign
authority .
In
such
a
case the
general
will
is
not
doubtful,
and
it is
clear
that the primary
intention
of the
people is that
the
State
should
not perish .
In this way the suspension
of the legislative
power
does
not involve
its
abolition
;
the
magistrate
who
silences it
can make it
speak ; he
dominates
it
without
having
power to
represent
it ; he can do everything
but make laws .
The first method
was
employed
by the Roman
Senate when it
charged
the consuls , by a consecrated
formula , to
provide
for
215


216
The Social Contract .
the safety of the Republic .
The
second was adopted
when one
of the two consuls
nominated
a dictator , * a usage of which Alba
had furnished
the precedent to Rome.
At the beginning
of the Republic they very often had recourse
to the dictatorship , because the
State
had not yet a sufficiently
firm foundation
to be able
to maintain
itself by the vigour of its
constitution
alone .
Public
morality rendering
superfluous
at that time
many pre-
cautions
that would have
been
necessary at another
time, there
was no fear
either
that a dictator
would
abuse his authority or
that he would
attempt
to
retain
it beyond
the term .
On the
contrary , it seemed
that so great a power
must
be a burden to
him who was invested
with it, such
haste did he make
to divest
himself of it, as if to take the place of the laws were an office too
arduous and too dangerous .
Therefore it is the danger , not of its abuse , but of its degrada-
tion, that
makes
me blame the
indiscreet
use of this
supreme
magistracy in early times ; for whilst it was freely used at elections ,
at dedications , and in purely
formal
matters , there was reason to
fear that it would become
less formidable
in case of need , and
that the people
would grow accustomed
to regard
as an empty
title that which was only employed
in empty ceremonies .
Towards the close of the Republic , the Romans , having
become
more
circumspect , used the dictatorship
sparingly
with as little
reason
as they had formerly
been
prodigal
of it. It was easy to
see that their
fear
was
ill
-
founded
;
that the
weakness
of the
capital then constituted
its security
against
the magistrates whom
it
had within
it;
that
a
dictator
could
,
in
certain
cases
,
defend
the
public liberty without
ever
being
able
to
assail
it;
and that the
chains of Rome would not be forged
in
Rome itself
,
but
in
her
armies
.
The slight resistance which Marius
made
against
Sylla
,
and Pompey
against Cæsar
,
showed
clearly what might be looked
for from the authority
within against the force without
.
This
error
caused
them
to
commit
great
mistakes
;
such
,
for
example
,
was that
of
not appointing
a
dictator
in
the Catiline
affair
;
for
as
it
was only
a
question
of
the interior
of
the city
,
or
at
most
of
some
province
of
Italy
,
a
dictator
,
with
the unlimited
authority
that the laws gave him
,
would
have easily broken up the
conspiracy
,
which was suppressed only by
a
combination
of
happy
accidents
such
as
human
prudence
could
not have foreseen
.
*
This nomination was made by night and in secret as
if
they were
ashamed to set
a
man above the laws
.


The Dictatorship .
217
1
However
Instead of that , the
Senate was content to entrust all its power
to the consuls
; whence it happened
that
Cicero, in order to act
effectively
, was constrained
to exceed
his
authority
in a material
point , and
that , although
the
first
transports
of joy
caused
his
conduct to be approved , he was afterwards justly called
to account
for the
blood of citizens
shed
contrary to the laws , a reproach
which could not have
been
brought
against a dictator .
But the
consul's eloquence
won over everybody
; and he himself , although
a Roman , preferred
his
own
glory to his
country's
good ,
and
sought not so much the
most
certain
and
legitimate
means of
saving the State
as the way to
secure the
whole
credit of this
affair.*
Therefore
he
was justly
honoured
as the
liberator
of
Rome and justly punished
as
a violator of the laws .
brilliant his recall may have been , it was certainly
a pardon .
Moreover , in whatever
way this
important
commission
may be
conferred, it is important
to fix its duration at a very short
term
which can never be prolonged
.
In the crises which
cause it to be
established
, the State is soon destroyed
or saved ; and , the urgent
need having
passed away , the dictatorship
becomes
tyrannical
or
useless .
In Rome the dictators
held
office for six
months
only,
and the majority
abdicated
before the
end
of this
term .
Had
the term been longer , they would
perhaps
have
been
tempted to
prolong it still further , as the Decemvirs
did their term of one
year.
The
dictator
only had
time
to
provide
for the
necessity
which had
led to his
election
; he had no time to think of other
projects.
* He could not be satisfied about this in proposing a dictator ;
he
dared not nominate himself , and could not feel sure that his colleague
would nominate him .


CHAPTER VII.
THE CENSORSHIP
25
JUST
as the
declaration
of the general will is made by the law,
the
declaration
of public
opinion is made by the
censorship .
Public opinion is a kind of law of which the
censor is minister ,
and which he only applies
to particular
cases
in the manner of
the Prince.
The
censorial
tribunal , then , far from being the arbiter of the
opinion ofthe people , only declares it, and
so soon
as it departs
from this position , its decisions
are fruitless
and ineffectual .
It is useless to distinguish
the
character of a nation from the
objects of its
esteem, for all these
things
depend
on the
same
principle
and are
necessarily
intermixed .
In all the nations
of
the world it is not nature but opinion which decides the choice of
their pleasures .
Reform men's opinions and their manners
will
be purified
of themselves .
People always
like what is becoming
or what
they judge
to be so ; but it is in this judgment
that they
make
mistakes
; the question , then , is to guide
their
judgment .
He who judges of manners judges of honour ;
and he who judges
of honour takes his law from opinion.
The opinions of a nation
spring from
its
constitution
.
Although
the law does
not
regulate
morality
,
it
is
legislation
that
gives
it
birth
,
26
and
when
legislation
becomes
impaired
,
morality
de-
generates
;
but then the judgment
of
the censors will not do what
the power of the laws has failed
to
do
.
It
follows from this that the censorship
may be useful
to
preserve
morality
,
never
to
restore
it
.
Institute
censors
while the
laws
are vigorous
;
so
soon
as
they have
lost their
power
all
is
over
.
Nothing that
is
lawful
has any force when the laws
cease
to
have
any
.
The censorship
supports
morality
by preventing
opinions from
being corrupted
,
by
preserving
their integrity
through
wise appli-
cations
,
sometimes
even by fixing
them when
they are still un-
certain
.
The use of seconds
in
duels
,
carried
to
a
mad
extreme
in
the kingdom
of
France
,
was abolished
by these simple
words
in
218


The Censorship.
219
an edict of the king : " As for those who
have
the
cowardice
to
appoint seconds ."
This judgment
, anticipating
that of the public ,
immediately
decided
it.
But when the same
edicts
wanted
to
declare
that it was
also
cowardice
to fight a duel, which is very
true , 27 but contrary
to common
opinion , the public ridiculed this
decision , on which its judgment
was already formed .
I have said
elsewhere * that as public opinion is not subject to
constraint , there
should
be no
vestige
of this in the tribunal
established
to represent it.
We cannot
admire too much the art
with which this force , wholly lost
among the moderns , was
set in
operation among the Romans and still
better
among
the Lace-
dæmonians .
A
man of bad
character
having
brought
forward
a
good
measure in the Council
of Sparta , the
ephors , without regarding
him ,
caused
the
same
measure
to
be
proposed
by
a virtuous
citizen .
What an honour for the one , what a stigma for the other ,
without praise or blame being given to either !
Certain
drunkards
from Samos † 28 defiled
the tribunal of the ephors
; on the morrow
a public edict granted
permission
to the Samians to be filthy.
A
real punishment
would have been less severe than such impunity.
When Sparta pronounced
what was or was not honourable
, Greece
made no appeal from her decisions .
* I merely indicate in this chapter
what I have treated
at
greater
length
in the Letter to M. d'Alembert .
They were from another island , which the delicacy of our language
forbids us to name on this occasion .


f
CHAPTER
VIII .
CIVIL Religion.
MEN had at first
no kings
except the gods and no government
but a theocracy.29
They reasoned like Caligula , and at that time
they reasoned rightly.
A long period
is needed to change
men's
sentiments
and
ideas
in order that they
may
resolve to take a
fellow-man as a master and flatter themselves
that all will be well.
From the single circumstance
that a god was placed at the head
of every political society , it followed
that there were as many gods
as nations.30
Two
nations
foreign
to
each
other ,
and
almost
always hostile , could not long acknowledge
the same master ; two
armies engaged in battle with each other could
not obey the same
leader .
Thus from national divisions
resulted
polytheism , and ,
from this , theological
and civil intolerance , which
are by
nature
the same , as will be shown
hereafter .
The fancy
of the
Greeks
that they recognized
their own gods
among barbarous
nations
arose from their regarding
themselves as
the natural
sovereigns of those nations .
But in our days
that
is
a very ridiculous kind of erudition
which turns on the identity of
the gods of different
nations , as if Moloch , Saturn , and
Chronos
could be the same god !
31
As if the Baal of the Phoenicians , the
Zeus of the Greeks , and the Jupiter of the Latins
could
be the
same !
As if there could
be anything
in common
among imagin-
beings bearing
different
names !
aryBut if it is asked why under
paganism , when every State had
its
worship
and its gods
,
there were no wars
of
religion
,I
answer that
it
was for the same
reason
that
each
State
,
having
its
peculiar
form
of
worship
as
well
as
its
own government
,
did not distinguish
its gods from
its
laws
.
Political
warfare
was
also
religious
;
the
departments
of
the
gods were
,
so
to
speak
,
fixed by the limits
of
the
nations
.
The god of one
nation
had
no
right
over
other
nations
.
The gods
of
the pagans
were
not jealous
gods
;
they
shared among them the empire
of
the world
;
even Moses and the
Hebrew nation
sometimes countenanced
this idea by speaking
of
the god of Israel
.
It
is
true that they
regarded
as
nought
the
220


Civil Religion.
221
gods ofthe Canaanites , proscribed
nations , devoted to destruction ,
whose
country
they were to occupy
; but
see how they
spoke of
the divinities of the neighbouring
nations
whom
they were for-
bidden to attack : "The possession of what
belongs
to Chamos
your god ,” said Jephthah
to the
Ammonites
, " is it not lawfully
your due ?
By the same title we possess the lands which our con-
quering god has acquired .” *
In this, it seems to me, there was a
well-recognised
parity between the rights of Chamos
and those of
the god of Israel.
But when the Jews , subjected
to the
kings
of Babylon, and
afterwards
to the kings of Syria , obstinately
refused to acknowledge
any other god than their own , this refusal
being regarded
as a re-
bellion
against the conqueror , drew upon them the
persecutions
which we read of in their history , and of which no other
instance
appears
before Christianity.†
Every religion, then , being
exclusively
attached
to the laws of
the State which prescribed
it, there was no other way of convert-
ing a nation than to subdue
it,
and
no
other
missionaries
than
conquerors ; and the obligation
to change their form of worship
being the law imposed
on the
vanquished , it was
necessary to
begin by conquering
before
speaking
of conversions .
Far from
EX men
fighting
for the gods , it
was, as in Homer , the
gods
who
fought for men ; each sued for victory
from his own god and paid
for it with
new altars .
The
Romans, before
attacking
a
place ,
summoned its gods to
abandon
it ; and
when
they left to the
Tarentines their exasperated gods , it was because they then re-
garded these gods
as subjected
to their own
and
forced
to
pay
them homage .
They left the vanquished
their
gods
as they left
them their laws .
A crown for the Capitoline
Jupiter
was often
the only tribute
that they imposed .
At
last , the Romans having
extended their worship and their
laws with their empire , and having themselves
often adopted those
*"Nonne ea quae possidet Chamos deus tuus tibi jure debentur ?"
(Judges xi. 24 ).
Such is the text of the Vulgate .
Père
de Carrières
has translated it thus : " Do you not believe that you have a right to
possess what belongs to Chamos your god ?
I am ignorant
of the
force of the Hebrew
text , but I see that in the Vulgate Jephthah
posi-
tively acknowledges the right of the god Chamos , and that the French
translator
weakens this acknowledgment
by an " according
to you "
which is not in the Latin .
+ There is the strongest
evidence that the
war of the Phocæans ,
called a sacred war, was not a war
of
religion .
Its object
was to
punish sacrilege , and not to subdue unbelievers .


222
The Social Contract.
of the vanquished , the nations of this vast empire , since the right
of citizenship
was granted to all, found
insensibly
that they had
multitudes
of gods
and
religions , almost the same
everywhere
;
and this is why paganism was at length
known
in the world as
only a single religion .
(It
was in these
circumstances
that Jesus came to establish on
earth a spiritual
kingdom , which , separating
the religious from the
political system , destroyed
the unity of the State, and caused the
intestine
divisions
which have never
ceased to
agitate
Christian
nations .
Now this new idea
of a kingdom
in the other
world
having
never
been
able to
enter the minds of the pagans , they
always regarded
Christians
as actual rebels , who , under cover of a
hypocritical submission , only sought an opportunity
to make them-
selves independent
and
supreme , and to
usurp
by cunning the
authority
which, in their weakness , they
pretended
to
respect .
This was the cause of persecutions .
What the pagans had feared
came to pass.
Then
everything
changed
its aspect ; the humble
Christians
altered their tone , and
soon this pretended
kingdom
of the other world became , under a
visible chief, the most violent
despotism
in this world.
As , however , there
have always been a Prince and civil laws , a
perpetual
conflict
of jurisdiction
has
resulted
from this
double
power , which has rendered
any good polity impossible
in Christian
States ; and no one has ever succeeded in understanding
whether
he was bound to obey the ruler or the priest.32
Many nations , however , even in Europe or on its
outskirts ,
wished to preserve or to re-establish the ancient
system, but with-
out success ; the spirit of Christianity prevailed
over everything .
The
sacred worship
always retained or regained
its
independence
of the sovereign
,
and without
any
necessary
connexion
with the
body
of
the State
.
Muhammad
33
had very sound views
;
he thor-
oughly
unified
his political system
;
and
so
long
as
his
form of
government
subsisted
under his successors
,
the khalifs
,
the govern-
ment was quite
undivided
and
in
that respect
good
.
But
the
Arabs
having
become
flourishing
,
learned
,
polished
,
effeminate
,
and indolent
,
were subjugated
by the
barbarians
,
and
then the
division
between
the two powers began again
.
Although
it
may
be
less
apparent
among
the
Muhammadans
than
among
the
Christians
,
the division
nevertheless
exists
,
especially
in
the
sect
of Ali
;
and
there
are
States
,
such
as
Persia
,
in
which
it
is
still
seen
.
Among
us
,
the kings
of
England have established
themselves
as
heads
of
the church
,
and the Tsars
have done the same
;
but by

i
means of this
title
they
have
made
themselves
its
ministers
34
rather than its rulers ; they have acquired
not so much the right
of changing it
as the power
of maintaining
it ; they are not its
legislators but only
its
princes
.
Wherever the clergy form
a
cor-
poration
,*
they are masters and
legislators
in
their own country
.
There
are
,
then
,
two
powers
,
two sovereigns
,
in
England and
in
Russia
,
just
as
elsewhere
.
Of all Christian authors
,
the philosopher Hobbes
35
is
the only
one who has clearly
seen the evil and its remedy
,
and who
has
dared
to
propose
a
reunion
of
the heads
of
the eagle and the com-
plete
restoration
of
political
unity
,
without
which
no
State
or
government will
ever be well constituted
.
But he ought
to
have
seen that the domineering
spirit
of
Christianity was incompatible
with
his
system
,
and that the interest
of
the priest would always
be stronger
than that of the State
.
It
is
not so
much what
is
horrible and false
in
his political theory
as
what
is
just and
true
that has rendered
it
odious
.†
I
believe
that by developing
historical
facts
from
this
point
of
view
,
the opposite
opinions
of
Bayle
36
and Warburton might easily
be refuted
.
The former of these maintains
that
no religion
is
useful to the body
politic
;
the latter
,
on the other hand
,
asserts
that Christianity
is
its
strongest
support
.
To the first
it
might
be
proved that no State was ever founded
without
religion
serving
as
its basis
,
and
to
the second
,
that the Christian law
is
more
injuri-
ous than useful to
a
firm constitution
of the
State
.
In
order
to
succeed
in
making
myself
understood
,I
need only give
a
little
more precision
to
the
exceedingly
vague ideas about religion
in
its
relation to my subject
.
Religion
,
considered
with reference
to
society
,
which
is
either
*
It
must
,
indeed
,
be remarked
that
it
is
not
so
much the formal
assemblies
,
like those
in
France
,
that bind the clergy into one body
,
as the communion
of churches
.
Communion
and excommunication
are the social pact
of
the clergy
,
a
pact by means
of
which they will
always be the masters
of
nations and kings
.
All
priests who
are of
the
same
communion
are fellow
citizens
,
though
they
are
as
far
asunder
as
the poles
.
This
invention
is
a
master
-
piece of policy
.
There was nothing similar among pagan priests
;
therefore they never
formed
a
body of clergy
.
+
See
,
among others
,
in
a
letter from Grotius
to
his
brother of the
11th April
,
1643
,
what that learned man approves and what he blames
in
the
book De Cive
.
It
is
true that
,
inclined
to
indulgence
,
he
appears
to
pardon the author for the good for the sake of the evil
,
but
everyone
is
not so merciful
.


224
The Social Contract.
general
or particular , may also be divided into two kinds , viz . the
religion of the man and
that
of the
citizen .
The
first, without
temples , without
altars , without
rites , limited
to the purely internal
worship
of the supreme God and to the eternal duties of morality ,
is the pure and simple
religion
of the Gospel , the true theism, and
what may be called
the natural divine law.
The other, inscribed
in a single country , gives to it
its
gods
,
its
peculiar
and
tutelary
patrons
.
It
has
its
dogmas
,
its
rites
,
its
external
worship pre-
scribed
by the laws
;
outside the single nation which observes
it,
everything
is
for
it
infidel
,
foreign
,
and barbarous
;
it
extends
the
duties and rights
of
men only
as
far
as
its
altars
.
Such were all
the religions
of
early nations
,
to
which may be given the name of
divine
law
,
civil
or
positive
.
There
is
a
third and more extravagant kind
of
religion
,
which
,
giving
to
men two sets
of
laws
,
two chiefs
,
two countries
,
imposes
on them
contradictory
duties
,
and
prevents them from being
at
once devout
men and citizens
.
Such
is
the religion of the Lamas
,
such
is
that
of
the Japanese
,
such
is
Roman Christianity
.
This
may be called the religion
of
the priest
.
There results from
it
a
kind of mixed and unsocial
law which has no name
.
Considered politically
,
these
three
kinds
of
religion
all
have
their
defects
.
The third
is
so
evidently
bad that
it
would be
a
waste
of
time
to
stop and
prove
this
.
Whatever destroys
social
unity
is
good for nothing
;
all institutions
which put
a
man
in
contradiction
with himself are worthless
.
The second
is
good
so
far
as
it
combines
divine
worship with
love for the laws
,
and
,
by making
their country the object
of
the
eitizens
adoration
,
teaches them that to serve the State
is
to serve
the guardian deity
.
It
is
a
kind
of
theocracy
,
in
which
there
ought
to
be no pontiff but the Prince
,
no
other
priests
than
the
magistrates
.
Then
to
die for one's country
is
to
suffer martyrdom
,
to
violate
the laws
is
to
be impious
,
and
to
subject
a
guilty
man
to
public
execration
is
to
devote him
to
the wrath
of
the gods
:
Sacer esto.37
But
it
is
evil in so far
as
being based on error and falsehood
,
it
deceives
men
,
renders
them
eredulous
and superstitious
,
and
obscures the true worship of the Deity with vain
ceremonial
.
It
is
evil
,
again
,
when
,
becoming
exclusive
and tyrannical
,
it
makes
a
nation sanguinary
and intolerant
,
so
that
it
thirsts
after nothing
but murder
and
massacre
,
and
believes
that
it
is
performing
a
holy action
in
killing whosoever
does not
acknowledge
its
gods
.
This puts such
a
nation
in
a
natural
state
of
war with all others
,
which
is
very prejudicial
to
its own safety
.


Civil Religion.
225
There
remains ,
then , the religion of man or Christianity , not
that of to-day , but that
of the
Gospel ,
which
is
quite
different .
By this holy, sublime , and pure religion , men , children
of the same
God, all recognize
one another
as brethren , and
the
social
bond
which unites them is not dissolved
even at death .
But this religion, having no particular
relation
with the body
politic , leaves to the laws
only the
force
that
they derive
from
themselves , without adding to them any
other ; and
thereby
one
of the great
bonds
of the
particular
society remains
ineffective .
What is more , far from attaching
the hearts of citizens to the State ,
it detaches them
from it and from all earthly things . I know of
nothing more contrary
to the social spirit.
We are told that a nation
of true
Christians
would form
the
most perfect society
conceivable .
In this supposition I see only
one great difficulty -that a society of true Christians
would be no
longer
a society of men .
I say even that
this
supposed
society , with all
its
perfection
,
would be neither
the strongest nor the most durable
;
by virtue of
its perfection
it
would lack cohesion
;
its
perfection
,
indeed
,
would
be its destroying
vice
.
Each man would
perform
his
duty
;
the people
would
be obe-
dient
to
the laws
,
the chief men would be just and moderate
,
and
the
magistrates
upright
and
incorruptible
;
the
soldiers
would
despise
death
;
there would be
neither
vanity
nor luxury
.
All
this
is
very good
;
but let
us
look further
.
Christianity
is
an
entirely
spiritual
religion
,
concerned
solely
with heavenly
things
;
the Christian's
country
is
not
of
this world
.
He does
his
duty
,
it
is
true
;
but he
does
it
with
a
profound
indifference
as
to
the
good
or
ill
success
of
his
endeavours
.
Provided that he has nothing
to
reproach
himself with
,
it
matters
little
to
him whether all goes well
or
ill
here below
.
If the State
is
flourishing
,
he scarcely
dares
to
enjoy the public felicity
;
he
fears
to
take
a
pride
in
the
glory
of
his
country
.
If
the
State
declines
,
he
blesses the hand of God which lies heavy
on his
people
.
In order
that the
society
might
be
peaceable
and
harmony
maintained
,
it
would be necessary for all citizens without exception
to
be equally
good
Christians
;
but
if
unfortunately
there happens
to be
in
it
a
single ambitious
man
,
a
single
hypocrite
,
a
Catiline
or
a
Cromwell
38
for example
,
such
a
man will certainly
obtain
an
advantage
over his pious compatriots
.
Christian charity
does not
suffer men readily
to
think
ill
of
their neighbours
.
As soon as
a
man has found by cunning
the art
of
imposing
on them
and

226
The Social Contract .
securing to himself a share in the public authority , he is invested
with
dignity
; God wills that he should
be reverenced
.
Soon he
exercises
dominion ; God wills that
he should
be obeyed .
The
depositary
of this power
abuses it ; this is the rod with which
God
punishes
his children.
They
would have
scruples
about
driving out the
usurper ; it would
be
necessary to disturb
the
public
peace ,
to
employ
violence , to shed
blood ; all this
ill
accords with the meekness of the Christian
,
and
,
after all
,
does
it
matter
whether
they
are free
or
enslaved
in
this
vale of woes
?
The
essential thing
is
to
reach
paradise
,
and
resignation
is
but
one means the more towards
that
.
Some
foreign
war comes on
;
the citizens march
to
battle with-
out anxiety
;
none of them think of flight
.
They do their
duty
,
but without an ardent
desire for victory
;
they know better how
to die than to conquer
.
What matters
it
whether
they are the
victors
or
the vanquished
?
Does not Providence know
better
than they what
is
needful
for them
?
Conceive
what
an advan-
tage
a
bold
,
impetuous
,
enthusiastic
enemy can
derive
from this
stoical indifference
!
Set against
them
those
noble
peoples
who are consumed
with
a
burning
love
of
glory
and
of
country
.
Suppose
your Christian
republic
opposed
to
Sparta
or
Rome
;
the
pious
Christians
will
be beaten
,
crushed
,
destroyed
,
before
they have time
to
collect
themselves
,
or
they will owe their safety
only
to
the contempt
which the enemy may conceive
for them
.
To my mind that was
a
noble
oath
39
of
the soldiers
of
Fabius
;
they did not swear
to
die
or
to
conquer
,
they swore
to
return
as
conquerors
,
and
kept their oath
.
Never would Christians
have
done such
a
thing
;
they
would
have
believed
that
they
were
tempting
God
.
But
I
am mistaken
in
speaking
of
a
Christian republic
;
each
of
these
two words excludes
the other
.
Christianity
preaches
only
servitude
and dependence
.
Its spirit
is
too favourable
to
tyranny
for the latter
not
to
profit
by
it
always
.
True Christians
are
made
to
be
slaves
;
they know
it
and are hardly
aroused
by
it
.
This short life has too little value
in
their eyes
.

became
Christians
, this
rivalry no longer
subsisted
;
and
when
the cross
had
driven
out the
eagle, all the Roman
valour disappeared .
But , setting
aside political
considerations
, let us return
to the
subject of right and determine
principles
on this important
point .
The right which the social
pact
gives to the
sovereign
over
its
subjects
does not
,
asI
have said
,
pass the limits
of
public utility
.*
Subjects
,
then
,
owe no account
of
their opinions
to
the sovereign
except
so
far
as
those opinions
are
of
moment
to
the community
.
Now
it
is
very important
for the State that every citizen
should
have
a
religion which
may make
him delight
in
his
duties
;
but
the
dogmas
of
this
religion
concern
neither
the
State
nor its
members
,
except
so
far
as
they affect
morality
and the
duties
.
which
he who professes
it
is
bound
to
perform
towards
others
.
Each may have
,
in
addition
,
such opinions
as
he pleases
,
without
its being the business of the sovereign
to
know them
;
for
,
as
he
has no jurisdiction
in
the other world
,
the destiny
of
his subjects
in the life
to
come
,
whatever
it
may be
,
is
not his affair
,
provided
they are good citizens
in
this life
.
There
is,
however
,
a
purely
civil profession
of
faith
,
the articles
of which
it
is
the duty of the sovereign
to
determine
,
not exactly
as
dogmas
of
religion
,
42
but
as
sentiments
of
sociability
,
without
which
it
is
impossible
to
be
a
good citizen
or
a
faithful subject
.†
Without
having
power to compel
any
one to
believe
them
,
the
"
In the commonwealth
,"
says the Marquis
d'Argenson
,"
"
each
is
perfectly free
in
what does not injure others
."
That
is
the unalter-
able limit
;
it
cannot be more accurately
placed
.
I
could
not
deny
myself the pleasure
of
sometimes quoting this
manuscript
,
although
it
is
not known
to
the public
,
in
order
to
do honour
to
the memory of
an illustrious
and honourable man
,
who preserved even
in
office
the
heart of
a
true citizen
,
and just and sound opinions about the govern-
ment of his country
.
+
Cæsar

in
pleading
for Catiline
,

to
establish
the dogma
of

Cato and
Cicero
,

confute him
,
did not
waste time
in
philosophizing
;
they were
content
to
show that
Cæsar
spoke
as
a
bad citizen and put forward
a
doctrine
pernicious
to
the
State
.
Indeed
,
it
was that which
the Roman
Senate had
to
decide

and not

theological
question

sovereign
may banish
from the State
whoever
does
not
believe
them ; it
may
banish
him not as impious, but
as unsociable , as
incapable
of sincerely
loving law and justice and of sacrificing at
need his life to his duty .
But if any
one , after publicly
acknow-
ledging
these
dogmas , behaves like an unbeliever
in them ,
he
should be punished
with death ; he has committed
the greatest
of
crimes , he has lied before the laws .
The dogmas of civil religion
ought to be simple , few in number
stated with precision , and
without
explanations
or commentaries
.
The existence of the Deity, powerful , wise , beneficent , prescient,
and bountiful , the life to come , the happiness
of the just, the
punishment
of the wicked , the sanctity of the social contract and
of the laws ; these are the positive
dogmas .
As for the negative
dogmas , I limit them to one only, that is, intolerance
; it belongs
to the creeds which we have excluded .
Those who distinguish civil intolerance
from theological intoler-
ance are, in my opinion, mistaken .
These two kinds of intolerance
are
inseparable .
It is
impossible
to live at peace with
people
whom
we believe to be damned
; to
love them
would be to
hate
God who punishes
them .
It is absolutely
necessary to reclaim
them or to punish
them .
Wherever theological intolerance
is
allowed , it
cannot
but
have
some
effect in civil life ; * and
as
soon as it has any , the sovereign
is no longer
sovereign
even
in
* Marriage ,43for example , being a civil contract , has civil conse-
quences, without which
it is even
impossible
for society to
subsist .
Let us , then , suppose that a clergy should succeed
in arrogating to itself
the sole right to perform this
act , a right which it must necessarily
usurp in every intolerant religion ; then, is it not clear that in taking
the
opportunity
to strengthen the Church's
authority , it will render
ineffectual that of the Prince , which will no longer have any subjects
except those
which
the
clergy are pleased to give it ?
Having the
option of marrying
or not marrying people, according
as they hold or
do not hold such or such a doctrine , according as they admit or reject
such or such a formulary , according as they are more or less devoted
to it, is it not clear that by behaving prudently and keeping firm , the
Church
alone will dispose
of inheritances , offices , citizens , and the
State itself, which
cannot subsist
when only
composed of bastards ?
But , it will
be said, men will appeal
as
against
abuses
; they will
summon , issue decrees , and seize on the temporalities .
What a pity !
The clergy , however little they may have, I do not say of courage , but
of good sense , will
let
this
be
done and
go
their way
;
they will quietly
permit
appealing
,
adjourning
,
decreeing
,
seizing
,
and will
end by
remaining
masters
.
It
is
not
,
it
seems
to me
,
a
great sacrifice
to
abandon
a
part
,
when one
is
sure
of
getting possession of the whole

secular
affairs ; from
that time
the priests
are the real
masters ;
the kings
are only their officers .
Now that there is , and can be, no longer
any exclusive
national
a religion , we should
tolerate all those which
tolerate
others , so far
as their dogmas
have nothing contrary
to the duties of a citizen .
But whosoever
dares to say : "Outside the Church no salvation ,"
ought to be driven
from the State , unless the State be the Church
and the Prince be the pontiff.
Such a dogma is proper only in a
theocratic government
; in any other it is pernicious
.
The reason
for

to
have
embraced

religion
ought to have made any honourable
man renounce it, and
especially any prince
who knew how to reason .
CHAPTER IX.
CONCLUSION .
AFTER laying
down the principles of political right
and attempt-
ing to establish
the
State on its foundations
, it would remain to
strengthen
it in its external
relations
; which would
comprise
the
law of nations , commerce , the right of war and
conquests , public
rights , alliances , negotiations , treaties , etc.
But all this forms
a
new subject
too vast for my limited scope . I ought
always
to
have confined
myself to a narrower
sphere .

Rousseau (see Letter to Moultou , 30th May, 1762 ) believed
that the Social
Contract would
be well received in his native city on
account of the praise bestowed on aristocratic
government
; but the
work was burned , and in 1763 he renounced his citizenship .

shake off the
yoke , they do
so with as much right
and justice

Rousseau
rightly
insists
on this
as the object of
the institution
of the
State ;
but the
reasoning
in this chapter is
chiefly
of a verbal
and trivial
nature
(especially the metaphysical
discussion
on power and will).
The real problem
is
to
determine
what the general will is and what is for the common good .

4 legislative power and executive
power.
The division in question
is not inaccurate , unless , like
Rousseau , we identify sovereignty with
the legislative power.
The real point at issue is the distinction
be-
tween supreme and subordinate powers , for sovereignty is manifested in
the executive
as well as in the legislative .

The logical sequence
is not at all clear.
Though

good , it seems that the people may be deceived and pass bad resolu-
tions .

11 only that part.
According to the terms of the social contract the
alienation is total, and the limitations now introduced are consequently
illusory .
12 cannot even wish to do so.
This is a corollary from " the sovereign
is everything that it ought to be."
But it has been admitted
(II. 3)
that the general will may lose its rectitude .
13 The reasoning in this chapter is vitiated
by the rigid distinction
between the general will and particular
wills .
Laws
may
relate to
particular
persons and facts ; and the State may charge
individuals
with executive functions , and so impose
special
burdens
upon them
(Bk . III . 18 and IV. 3).

society .

size of a State ; he fixed the number at 5,040 inhabitants (Laws V. 737).
Aristotle
also advocated States of a moderate size
(IV . 4) .
Rousseau
throughout
contends for the
superiority
of
small
States .
But the
analogy of the human body
as
applied by him, and his
notion
of a
maximum
of force , are
fallacious .
He knew
nothing
of local
self-
government , and thought only of the evils of great centralised monar-
chies like France or ancient Persia .

38 This paragraph is a good example of the
experiential
method ,
which Rousseau
too rarely
followed .
He appears , however , to be
largely indebted to Montesquieu .
39 No historical
State probably has ever combined
these qualifica-
tions for legislation .
A State which
is self-sufficing
and
can resist
any of its neighbours , while
so
small that all its
citizens know
one
another , is an impossibility
now, unless
large
States are willing to
tolerate its freedom .

The Social Contract
The struggle of its
people under
Paoli
against the
Genoese
had
excited general admiration in Europe .
41 Rousseau's definition of equality should be carefully observed .
42 (note ). This is probably a reference
to ancient States , especially
Rome in the last days of the Republic .
43 The experiential
method
is again followed , with
Montesquieu
(Book I. 3) as model .
44(note ). This observation of D'Argenson
is based on a superficial
view of the facts, for the benefits
of foreign
commerce
are
diffused
through the community .

This

appears
to
have
been borrowed
by

Hobbes

insisted strongly on this

but
he vested the supreme power
in
the chiefs
,
not
in

.
•
After
a
show
of
empty and confusing
mathematical
reasoning
,
Rousseau
enunciates
,
as
if
it
were
a
deduction
,
the inductive
truth
that the utility of the various forms of government
is
relative
to
race
,
climate
,
etc.
(
cf.

Rousseau appears
to
have thought that he was actually demon-
strating
,
instead of merely
elucidating
,
his
theories by this mathe-
matical argument
,
though
he was aware that
"
geometrical precision
has no place
in
moral quantities
."
Cf. Mill's Logic
,
Book VI

ch

8.
The reasoning
in
this
chapter
is
not very convincing
.
Even
if
the government
of
a
single
person
is
stronger and
more active
than
that
of
a
number
of
magistrates
,
which
is
affirmed without
any real
proof
,
it
is
by no means certain that the more numerous
a
magistracy
is
,
the more does the corporate will approach
the general will
.
If
Rousseau's metaphysical distinction
between the three wills
in
each
magistrate
be
accepted
,
it
implies
that the
particular will naturally
tends
to
dominate
the corporate and general wills
,
and that there-
fore
,
by the multiplication
of
magistrates
,
the public
welfare
is
more
likely
to
be sacrificed
to
private interests
.
It
must
be
noted that
what
Rousseau
calls governments
are
usually called forms
of
sovereignty
.

Rousseau's
remark
in
the fifth
paragraph
23
)


240
The Social Contract.
that
even monarchy
is capable of sub -division
is inconsistent
with
his own definition .
The kings of Sparta were
not
monarchs , and if
ever there
were
eight
contemporary
Roman
Emperors , which is
doubtful , they were not monarchs in the exact signification .
8 Plato
treated democracy as a
debased
form of commonwealth ,
characterised
by an excessive
freedom tending
to degenerate
into
licence (Republic VIII .) .
Aristotle
(III . 7) treated it as a perversion
of the republic (TOλiTeía ).
9 Taking democracy in the strict
sense of a form of government
in which the administration
is carried on by the whole , or a majority ,
of the citizens, Rousseau's statement that a true democracy
has
never
existed is probably correct, with the possible exception of early Teu-
tonic
communities
and a few Swiss
cantons.
Some
critics , how-
ever, have charged him with
being an opponent of democracy , using
this
term to
denote
a form
of
sovereignty .
As
Rousseau
takes
sovereignty to reside in the will of all , such a charge is baseless .
10 In this
paragraph
Rousseau
has Sparta
and Geneva
in mind .
Burke remarked (Reflections on the Revolution ) that pure democracies
of considerable size were few ; he also held that an absolute
demo-
cracy was not a legitimate
form of government , and was
especially
unsuited to large States
(
cf.
Montesquieu
,
Book VIII
.
20
).
11
The famous
author
is
Montesquieu
,
who
(
Book
V.
1)
spoke
of
virtue
as
the principle
of
a
republican State
.
But
in
a
prefatory
note
to
the Spirit
of
the Laws
,
he
explained
that by
"
virtue
,"
he
meant
political virtue
,
or
love
of
country and
of
equality
,
which
may
exist
more or less under all forms
of
government
.
Rousseau's
strictures
are therefore unfounded
.
12
Rousseau was probably thinking
of
the ancient
doctrine
of
the
easy degeneration
of
democracy into tyranny
.
18"I
prefer
a
perilous freedom
to
a
peaceful servitude
."

Hallam
(Lit. of
Europe I. 8) considers that Machiavelli
would rather have lived under
a republic than under a prince , but, unable to do so , he devoted him-
self to the prince who appeared most likely to free
Italy from foreign
armies , the " execrable
hero ,"
Cæsar Borgia .
Machiavelli
recom-
mended a strong, but not a tyrannical
government .
The Discourses
on Livy contains , like the
Prince , many unscrupulous
maxims , but
in it he praises small republics and supports popular
liberties against
princely despotism , which
may explain Rousseau's preference for this
work.

a refutation
of Rousseau .

Rousseau's " simple sign " of prosperity
is decep-

of the standard
of comfort , that is, by diminished
prosperity .
The
vast population of China is hardly a sign of prosperity.

52 Rousseau's preference for
small
States has already been
noted .
The
public
library of Geneva contains
a manuscript
sketch
of the
Social Contract , according
to
which the
State should
be limited to
one town at most, abuses being inevitable if there is a capital with
several subordinate towns .
53 The Great King is the Persian
king .
A sustained
contest like
that
between the Greek
cities
and the
Persians
would
hardly
be
possible
under
modern
conditions .
A city - state
like
Geneva
could
not have resisted France
single -handed .
Rousseau
ignores the fact
that the Dutch and Swiss
republics
grew up under the protection
of
the French
monarchy .
54 no longer any representative.
This is obviously
absurd , even
according
to
Rousseau's
own
account
of legislative
and executive
functions .
55 If representation
may
be dispensed
with
in
city - states , it is
necessary in large States, though
even
in these the
ultimate
sove-
reignty
may remain in the body of the people .
But
see
Government
of Poland, ch . VII .
56 In preferring
statute-labour
to taxation , Rousseau
is certainly
"far removed from ordinary ideas," and his plan could only be adopted
in small States.
He recommended the Poles to execute
their public
works on that system (Government ofPoland , ch. XI .).
57 counts for nothing .
This
seems
a glaring
absurdity
now, and
was certainly inaccurate when
Rousseau
wrote .
But the restriction
and improper distribution
of electoral power , together
with the gross
corruption
then prevalent, precluded an adequate
reflection of popular
views by the House of Commons
(
cf.
Letters from the Mountain
,
VI
.).

Rousseau

This
is
an unfortunate comment on popular assemblies
in
Rome
(
see note
51
above
).
The reforms
of
the
Gracchi
,
undertaken
in
a
democratic spirit
,
engendered
much popular agitation
and gave rise
to tumultuous assemblies
.
60
The lictors
were scarcely
representatives
,
for they had no real
authority
.
Their formal
meetings were
merely
a
survival
of
the old
aristocratic
comitia curiata
.
61
The tribunes

who exercised

In spite
of
his remarks
in
the
following
paragraph
,
Rousseau
certainly glosses over slavery
.

Bodin had

slavery
.
Montesquieu
denounced
it

a
famous chapter
(

and Voltaire
consistently opposed
it
.
The argument that slavery affords leisure
to
free citizens
and
so
makes for progress has
a
certain weight
,
and negro slavery
in
America
was defended
partly
on this
ground
.
But humane
considerations
outweigh this plea
.
It

64 (note).
Rousseau formulated a scheme for confederations of small
States, and entrusted his manuscript to the Comte d'Antraigues
, who
destroyed
it on the outbreak of the
Revolution

should sap the royal authority .

the Poles to

fect a system of federate governments , " the only one that

Poland, chapter V. ) .
65 contract .
The allusion is to supporters of the mediæval
form of
the compact theory .
66 There
is really
nothing
astonishing
in this .
Rousseau
merely
removes the restriction
he placed
on sovereignty when he limited
it
to legislative power.
This sudden conversion of the sovereign
people
into a democracy is a clumsy expedient to save a defective theory.
67 Grand Committee
is not an executive body , nor
is the House of
Commons a sovereign power .
Hence the analogy is false .
68 On the subject of this chapter , see Locke II . 13.
69 There
is an arbitrary
tone
about
this
paragraph .
Some
per-
manency is needed in an executive, and officers should not be forced
to accept any terms whatever.
Useful
modifications , however ,
are
suggested afterwards .

His opinion
that

ideas than Rousseau's .
But the latter is speaking of a true democracy ,
which he admits to be an ideal .
Unless all men are equally qualified
to rule , choice must always be preferable to lot.
16 a true aristocracy .
Since
all nobles who were twenty -five years
old were eligible to
sit
in
the Great Council
,
the government certainly
was an aristocracy according
to
Rousseau's own definition
.
Freeman
(
Comparative
Politics
,
p
.
240
)
speaks
of
Venice
and Poland
(
in
the
eighteenth century
)
as
containing survivals
of
the aristocratic primary
assemblies
.
The Barnabotes
were the poorer Venetian nobles
.
17
Geneva was also an aristocracy
.

classes

tion , but were excluded from the
highest
magistracies .
The
other
classes had few political rights .
19 The Abbé de Saint Pierre (b. 1658 , d . 1743) in his
Polysynodie
formulated
a plan for the administration
of France
by a system of
councils controlling
each department of State.
This would have in-
volved a limitation
of the royal authority , and therefore, as Rousseau
says , a change in the form of government .
19 No attempt has been made to criticise Rousseau's account of the
Roman
constitution .
The works
of
Mommsen
and
others
have
rendered
obsolete much
of the
teaching
on this
subject current
in
the last century .
Rousseau's numerous inaccuracies , however , do not
affect seriously the main
course of his
argument , which , in this and
the next three chapters, is largely overlaid with historical details .
He
probably had no clear ideas on the
subject of voting , and appears to
recommend Roman methods , which , however, are not at all applicable
to modern elections .
20 This remark shows that Rousseau did not regard the social con-
tract as historical .
" Rousseau's undiscriminating
praise of the relation between patron
and client
shows his aristocratic
spirit .
The system did_result_in
abuses ; and this fact, apart from its inapplicability
to modern
con-
ditions , is a good reason for not reviving it.
22 We at length come to the real subject of the chapter , the method
of voting .
23 These
remarks
on
the
tribuneship
have
no practical
value.
Rousseau
classes together the Roman
tribunes , who could
veto any
public business ; the Spartan
ephors , who controlled
the kings ; and
the Venetian
Council of Ten (too
strongly
described
as a "tribunal
of blood "), which
checked
the
encroachments of the
Senate .
The
negative
powers which
they all possessed
tended to become positive .
Representative
assemblies now
suffice to
check the
executive , and
are themselves held in check by the electors.
24 Rousseau's unbounded
admiration for Roman
policy
leads him
to commend one of the most dangerous institutions
(
cf.
Montesquieu
,
Book XII
.
19
).
25
Like the dictatorship
,
the censorship
is
unsuited
to
modern free
States
.
Bodin had recommended
a
censorship of manners
.
27
26
Rousseau makes morality

;
morality
in
its earlier

obedience

A fresh translation of Rousseau's

The

drive a select few to the real Rousseau , and if he does, he has justified
his existence as a commentator

was the leading feature
of
early societies , and his contention
that
men were not born free,
gave
him on these
points
a
superiority
over
adherents
of the
compact
theory , although
his general
conclusions
were as absurd
as they were
slavish .
Algernon Sidney was the first to oppose
Filmer .
In his
Discourses
on
Government
he
argued
against
absolutism
in
favour
of the
social
contract
theory
in its earlier
form , maintaining
that nations
may make contracts , either express
or implied, with their magistrates .
As the political
theories
of Milton
and
Hobbes sprang from
the troublous
times of the
Great
Rebellion , so that of Locke
expressed and vindicated
the principles of the Revolution of 1688.
He devoted
the first of Two Treatises of Civil Government (1690)
to a vigorous
attack upon Filmer , on the demolition of whose posi-
tions he bestowed
excessive labour.
The second treatise contains
a constructive
theory , avowedly built on the foundations
of Hooker,
whose name
carried
weight in the Tory camp .
Locke
seeks the
true
original , extent , and
end " of political
power , by which is
implied " the right of making
laws with penalties for the regulating
and
preserving
of property , and of employing
the force
of the
community
in the execution
of such laws , and in the defence of
the commonwealth
from foreign
injury , and all this
only for the
public good ."
66
After showing that no man has a natural
right to govern , Locke
portrays
the
state of nature — a state of freedom
and
equality
in
respect of jurisdiction and dominion, limited only by natural law
or reason , which
prohibits
men from
harming
one another in life ,
health , liberty, or possessions , the punishment
requisite
by way of
restraint or reparation
being in every man's hands .
" Men living
together
according
to reason without
a common
superior
on earth
with
authority
to judge between
them
is
properly
the state of
nature ."
He who tries to enslave
or kill another
puts
himself
into a state of war with the latter .
Every man has a natural right
of property
in his
own
person
and in the
product of his
own
labour exercised
on the materials
of nature . " As much
land as
a man tills , plants , improves , cultivates , and
can
use the
product
of, so much is his property
; " and this natural
right may still be.

In early times fathers exercised the executive
power
of
the law
of nature
,
not in virtue
of
their paternal
power
,
but by consent
of
their children
,
who
"
could
nowhere find
a
greater security
to
their
peace
,
liberties
,
and fortunes
than
in
the rule of
a
father
."
Chil-
dren are born
to
,
though
not
in
,
a
state
of
freedom
and
equality
.
"
The natural
fathers
of
families
by an insensible
change
became
the politic monarchs
of
them too
,"
and thus were laid the founda-
tions
of
hereditary
and
elective
kingdoms
;
but that
princes
exercise
government
de
facto does not prove
that
they have their
titles
in
the father's right
.
If
,
as
Locke said
,
the
state of nature
was
a
state
of
peace
,
goodwill
,
mutual
assistance
and
preserva-
tion
,"
it
is
hard
to
see why men
should
desire
political
society
.
But
it
appears
that they
were full
of
fears and
dangers
in
that
state
,
and their chief end
in
political union was the better
security
of individual rights
of
life and property
.
They therefore renounced
their natural
liberty
in
favour
of
civil liberty
,
and
then
they had
a
standing
rule
to
live by
,
common
to
every one
of
that society
,
and
made
by the
legislative
power
erected
in
it
."
In
short
,
necessity
,
convenience
,
and inclination urged men into society
.
A
political
society
differs
from
a
family
in
its
constitution
,

,
and end
.
"

are

into

,
and

them and

Men may either
freely unite
to

a

,
or
they may

In the former case
the will and

,
rightly pass for those
of
the whole
;
otherwise
nothing
could be done
,

The Social Contract .
mas itnes
This
""
jection that the social contract
is unhistorical
, Locke
replies
that
government
is
everywhere
anterior
to
records ," and
that the
beginnings
of Rome and Venice at least were due to the union of
free and independent
men , amongst whom
there
was
no natural
superiority .
But the first argument
is two -edged , and the second
does not bear investigation
; Locke , moreover , contradicts
himself
by admitting
that history
reveals
the
origin of commonwealths
generally
in the government
of one man , the father of a family, or
some one chosen for his merits as ruler
of several families , whose
power might by tacit submission
pass to the eldest son.
Almost
all early monarchies
were elective , " at least upon occasion ," and
that form of government
having
been
established by free consent
of the people
enabled
young
societies
to subsist .
If it be urged
that " every one is born
subject
to his father or his prince , and is
therefore
under
the
perpetual
tie of subjection
and
allegiance
,”
the reply is that men never admitted
such subjection
without
their
own
consent .
Posterity
cannot
be bound by compacts , but the
consent of free men born under
government
is given by each sepa-
rately as he comes of age , and
so passes unnoticed
.
Thus the
compact
is renewed
from generation
to generation
in the person
of every
citizen .
Children
are
free
to
choose
what
political
society
they will join ; but if they wish to enjoy
the inheritance
of their ancestors , they must submit
to all the conditions
annexed
thereto .
Tacit
consent
is inferred
from the tenure of property,
and is withdrawn
when a man
quits
the
country .

con-
sent is perpetually
binding unless the society itself is dissolved .

but
to

;"
and the law
of
nature
,
being
eternal
,
underlies
all
human
laws
.
The
legislative
power
is
required-
(1)
to govern by promulgated
laws
,
established
for the
common good alone
,
and
resting
ultimately
on the consent
and for alon
authority
of
the
people
,
from which laws no one
is
exempt
,
not
even the legislators
themselves
;
(2)
to
appoint
known and
im-
partial
judges
authorised
to
administer
the
laws
;
and
(3)
to
institute
a
power adequate
to
execute
them
.
"
The
legislative
opilative
being only
a
fiduciary
power
for certain
ends
,"
the
people
may
remove
or
alter
it
when
it
violates
the
trust
reposed
in
it
.
The
society
,
then
,
does
not covenant
with royalty
or
with any
other
'
form
of
government
,
but entrusts
its
power
to
certain
persons
,
who
may
,
if
necessary
,
be
replaced
.
Thus the
community always

retains
the supreme
power
or
ultimate
sovereignty
(a
term not
used by Locke
),
but
does
not assume
it
until the
government
is
dissolved
.
The legislative
has the right
to
direct the force
of
the
commonwealth
,
though
it
need not always remain
in
session
;
the
executive
power
should
be perpetual
,
as
the laws
have
a
lasting
force
.
To prevent

it
is

that the legislative

;
the

,
however
,

Where
both
powers
are

in
an

monarch
there
is
no civil

,
for there
is
no common judge
with

"
between him and his subjects
,
and the state of nature

.
War and peace
,

,
and foreign
affairs
generally
are
to
be
vested
in
the federative
power
,
which
,
also
in
subordination
to
the
legislative
,
should
be united with the
executive
,
in
order
that the
whole force
of
the community may be
in

.
The
form
of
the commonwealth
or

(

depends
on the placing
of
the
legislative

.

Can
legislative , which keeps the will that is the essence of the society.
The power
which
each
individual gave the
society
on entering
it cannot
be resumed
while
the
community
lasts , nor
can the
legislative
power
revert to the
society
unless
it was bestowed
for '
a limited
period .
But
a
government
may
be
dissolved
from
within , and
yet
the society may not
be destroyed .
The
legisla-
ture , finally, may be changed
both in persons and in form for the
common
good , though
the original contract
is perpetually
binding .
and irrevocable .
A revolution , therefore , is justifiable when the
government
ceases to fulfil its part of the contract-the protection
of personal
rights .
Hobbes and Locke , then, agreed that
men
emerged from the
freedom and equality of the state of nature by a covenant of the
majority
to form
a political society , which
compact
the law of
nature obliges
them to
observe .
But Locke did not agree
with
Hobbes that the natural
state was a state of war ; he seems , like
Hooker , to have
regarded
the
want of a common
judge and of
a known law
as the
chief inconvenience
of that
state.
Again,
Locke held that the power of the government
should
be carefully
limited , and he justified
any necessary revolution
on the part
of
the sovereign
people ; whereas
Hobbes pretended
that a govern-
ment
when
once
established
should
always
subsist
and
have
absolute
power , misgovernment
being
preferable to the evils that
attend rebellion.
Locke
also made a great
advance
on
Hobbes
by carefully
distinguishing
between
the establishment
(or dissolu-
tion) of a political society and that of a government , legislative
Més Idal or executive .
His ideal was
a moderate
constitutional
govern-
ment , sovereignty
limited
by the social
contract , and
he endea-
voured to show that this alone was justified by the law of nature .
His work began a new era of political opinion in Europe .
It has
been objected
that his doctrine
of the ultimate
sovereignty of the
people is open to the charge of sanctioning
frequent
revolutions,
but Locke
relied
with reason
on
man's
natural
inertia as an
adequate
safeguard against this danger .

people .
Riots in the provinces

attacks

revealed
from time to time the
" despair

disease
and
ghastly
poverty " that
reigned
throughout France .
Arthur Young , whose vivid pictures of the
state of affairs in 1787-89
abundantly
testified
to the urgent need
for a revolution
, roundly ascribed
this bristling
crop of abuses to
the sinister
influence
of the government .
Impressed
with
the
dignity
of men
as
men , the
eighteenth
century publicists assailed
established
institutions
with
unprece-
dented
freedom
and
vigour.
They were
filled with
enthusiasm
for that
imaginary
state of
nature
of which the
ancients
had
dreamed . "A return to
nature ," said
Taine , " meaning
by this
the abolition of society , was the war -cry of the
whole
encyclo-
pædic battalion ."
There
was an implicit
theism
in the current
use of the term " nature " ; the
notion
of nature
as " red
in
tooth and claw" belongs to the scientific
nineteenth
century .
Το
the writers of last
century , " the state of nature was the reign of
God ."
They knew nothing of the actual
life of primitive
man ;
in fact , they appear to have conceived
the natural
state
less
as a
definite
and universal
condition of the race in early times than as
an ideal condition of simplicity and innocence
strongly contrasting
with the artificiality
and
depravity
which prevailed
in their own
jage.
To seek an ideal
in the past
was characteristic
of a period
in which there
was no true
idea of progress .

law, now became
anarchical , and
permeated
all
particular
ideas
on law, society , and government .
The
French lawyers
changed
"all men are equal " into " all men
ought
to be
equal ," and
to
this they added , " all men ought to be free ."
The law of nature ,
thus modified , was transferred
from
the forum to the
street ; and
instead of a juridical theory it became an article of faith .
Liberty
and equality , now the great
political
ideals , were to be
realised
by a restoration of the state of nature .
But a radical
transforma-
tion of existing
institutions was an indispensable
pre -requisite of
the
evolution
of a more
perfect
society , and
hence
the
growth
of a revolutionary
spirit
in politics .
The philosophers
who
em-
bodied this new spirit had little knowledge
of history
or of affairs ,
but they were full of confidence
in the
natural
goodness
of the
individual .
They therefore
recommended
appeal
to the subjec-
tive reason as the highest
and ultimate authority .
Such a method
could
produce
only
negative
results ,
and
consequently
these
thinkers were, for the most
part , " architects of ruin ," endeavour-
ing, through
their mistrust
of all authorities , to undermine
the
Fold
order , without
being
competent
to frame
plans
for
a
new
order of a loftier type .
Yet their function
in clearing
the ground
was essential to reform
and progress
; and their
labours
rendered
possible the erection
of a more splendid
edifice
on surer
founda-
tions .
Amid
the
work
of
destruction ,
however ,
there
were
some
i
who
essayed
a
reconstruction
.
From
Mably
and
Morelly
I
emanated
socialistic
schemes , while
D'Argenson , the Abbé
de
Saint -Pierre , and
Montesquieu
propounded
moderate
constitu-
tional
reforms .
The
chief
of these ,
Montesquieu
,
is
usually
contrasted
with
Rousseau , and
despite
certain
points
of com-
munity , their differences
were fundamental
.
Montesquieu ( Spirit ) Dit betre
of the
Laws ,
1748) was
positive ,
inductive ,
experiential ,
and
historical in method
; Rousseau
was ideal , deductive , speculative ,
and
metaphysical .
The
one was
more
akin to Aristotle , the
other to Plato.
Both desired
to guarantee
individual rights
and
social liberty ; but Montesquieu
wished
to
attain
this
end by
amending the
constitution
,
Rousseau
by transforming
existent

; the latter proclaimed
the need
of a

and the
establishment
of popular

on
the
basis of the original
contract- a fiction which Montesquieu did
not
countenance
.
Again, while
Montesquieu
recognised
the
principle of the universal
vote , Rousseau
dwelt upon the rightful
authority of the general
will.
Montesquieu held that men were

Rousseau ,
more
than
all the
rest, was alive
to the necessity
of supplementing
destructive
criticism
by
a constructive
theory .
This was one
of his chief merits
in an
epoch
of disintegration .
In his earlier
works
he
assailed
vigorously
the
existing
state of
human
society , and indirectly exhibited
the need of revolutionary
changes .
The
other
philosophers
had
in the
main
accepted
civilisation
, though
they attacked
its abuses with unflinching zeal.
But Rousseau , in this respect , stood
aloof from his age.
He did
not , like Diderot, rely
on the systematisation of knowledge
and
the enlightenment
of the reason as the great means towards human
perfectibility
.
Desiring to cure the disease of civilisation
, he in-
culcated
extreme simplicity and
independence
of life.
He was
neither
optimistic ,
nor
sceptical ,
nor
epicurean ,
as
his
chief
contemporaries
were .
Nor
was
he
cosmopolitan
;
a national
spirit, a profound
patriotism , pervades
all
his work.
Rousseau ,
the man of feeling , was
sterner ,
more
serious , more
fervid
than
his great antagonist
Voltaire , the man of esprit ; he
was also less
tolerant .
In his
attacks
on those
who
consumed
the substance
of the poor, and
in his bold defence of popular rights , he was far

more vehement
than any
other
publicist.
No
mere
revision
of
established
institutions
would satisfy him ; society must be rebuilt
from its very foundations
.
Rousseau's
first work
( 1750)
was
a Discourse
on the question
whether the restoration
of the sciences and arts
has contributed
to
purify manners .
His answer was a direct
negative , for he believed
that social institutions
had transformed
the sincerity , confidence ,
and rude simplicity of the natural
man into deceit , suspicion , and
a hollow uniformity of conduct.
The prevalent
corruption
is due
to the
progress of the arts and sciences , which themselves , by a
mutuality of cause
and
effect , owed their origin to
men's vices ;
for without luxury there would
have
been
no arts , and
without
idleness
no
sciences .
The
freedom
and
courage , the equity
and
temperance , of primitive
men
have
passed
away ,
and
a
fatal
inequality
has
arisen
from
the
distinction
of
talents
and
the
disparagement
of the virtues .
We have chemists and astronomers ,
painters
and
poets , but
we no longer
have citizens .
What, then ,
is the
remedy ?
We
must
return
to the ignorance , innocence ,
and
poverty of
early times , for
thus
only can
real
happiness
be
attained.
A return
to
nature is the true
panacea
for the
ills of .
the
race .
Rousseau's
inaccurate
presentment
of history and
the unfairness
of his special
pleading
are
easily
apparent .
He
himself felt the
defects
of his work , admitting
that it was abso-
lutely devoid of logic and order , though full of warmth
and force .
These latter qualities , however , appealed powerfully to his readers ,
and the book raised
him immediately
to
fame .
Grimm reported
that it " made a kind of revolution
in Paris." " Never was there
such a success ," said Diderot .
Rousseau
followed up his trenchant
indictment of the vaunted
refinement
of his
age with a Discourse
on the origin and founda-
tions of inequality
among men ( 1754).
This influential work is
a
more elaborate
defence
of the position
that men were equal * in a

* According
to Mr.
Morley
(Rousseau, I. p .
181), Rousseau
never
says that all men are born equal .
But in his Dedication
to this
Dis-
course he refers to
the equality which nature has put among men,"
and in the
Social
Contract he speaks of " all
being
born
free
and
equal ."
In these statements he probably follows Locke
; and equality

state
of
nature ,
and
that
inequality
sprang
from
institutions .
Since the demolition
of the existing
social
order is essential to the
erection
of a more perfect system , the destructive
doctrines of the
second
Discourse
are
a necessary
prelude
to
the
constructive
theories of the Social
Contract .
Rousseau's
first aim was to depict
the state of nature , and he fully realised the difficulty
of the task .
"It is no light enterprise
to separate what is original and
what is
artificial in man's actual
nature , and to obtain
clear knowledge of
a state which no longer
exists , which perhaps
never
has
existed ,
which probably never
will
exist , but of which it is nevertheless
necessary to have true notions
in
order
to judge rightly of our
present state ."
To ascertain
the
true
foundations
of the
body
politic, we
must
go
in quest of the ideal , abstract , natural man .
But how can we discern
the majestic
simplicity of primitive man
through
the
manifold
deformities
which time and circumstances
have wrought in his mental and physical
constitution
?
Historical
truth is indeed
unattainable
; our
reasonings
can
only be
hypo-
thetical .
We must , however , try to explain the origin and progress
of inequality , the establishment
and abuses of political society,
so
far as these things are deducible
by the light
of nature
alone .
Rousseau
complains
that other writers , in describing
the state of
nature , have transferred
to it ideas peculiar to civil society ; but he
himself is liable to the same charge .
By divesting
men of their
artificial faculties , he vainly hoped to discover
them
as they came
from the hands of nature , ignorant of vice ,
simple ,
strong ,
and
courageous .
Primitive
men , he supposed , were
entirely
isolated
and guided
solely by instinct , while their mental
and physical
in-
equality
did not
operate prejudicially to any one .
In becoming
Beft
members of society they became feeble , fearful , and servile .
The
state of reflection
is contrary
to nature ; " the man who meditates
is a depraved
animal ."
.
The Discourse
attempts to fix the moment
when , right succeed-
may here mean simply equality in natural rights .
On the other hand,
it is true that Rousseau
has many
passages
in which
he admits
a
natural inequality in strength and intellect .

remarks
on equality among the Fuegians , see Darwin's Journal
of a Voyage in
the Beagle, ch. X.

devised rules

by which
all should
be
guaranteed

and
established
a
supreme ruler to enforce

laws
.
"
This
must
have
been the
origin

In this way
the law
of
nature gave place
to
civil law
.
Time has been unable
to
repair the defects
of
the political state
,
which was from the first irregular
and
imperfect
in
form
;
it
was
incessantly
patched
up
,
whereas
the
first thing necessary was
to
sweep clean away the old
materials
,
as
Lycurgus did
at
Sparta
,
and
then
erect
a
sounder
structure
.
This
shows
Rousseau's
revolutionary
spirit
;
he would utterly root
out
,
and
not
merely
reform
,
constitutions
which were the growth of centuries
.
At first
society
only
consisted
in
a
few
general
conventions
among
individuals
,
of
which the community
guaranteed
the observance
;
but continual
disorders
and the
impunity
of

led to
the institution
of

The
stages
in
the progress
of
inequality
are therefore-
(1)
the establishment
of
law and
of
the right
of
property
;
(2)
the institution
of

;
and
(3)
the change

It should be observed that this
is

The thirst for power
,
wealth
,
and
privileges
implies
a
condition
in
which the few are happy
at
the
cost of misery
to
others
,
and
this
inequality
leads
on
to
despotism
,
which once
more reduces
all men
to
equality
-
an equality
of
nothingness
.
In short
,
inequality
,
which
is
hardly
apparent
in
the
state
of
nature
,
derives
its
force
and
growth from
the development
of
our faculties
,
and
at
length
becomes
fixed and
legitimate
by the
establishment
of
property
and laws
.
But
it
is
manifestly
opposed
to
natural law that
a
handful
of
people
should
gorge superfluities
while the famished
multitude
lack the necessaries of life
.
Thus Rousseau
devoted
an extensive work
to
a
minute
descrip-
tion of an
imaginary
state
of
nature
and
of
man's
conjectural
passage from that state
to
civilised
society
.
The
audience
he
addressed
was not likely
to
criticise
his
positions
,
for speculation
on such topics
was
,
as
we have seen
,
a
fashion
of
the
time
,
while
its vividness
and fulness
of
detail
gave
an air of reality
to
this
striking piece of fiction
.
Voltaire remarked
that the treatise made
one long
to
walk on
all
-
fours
.
We perceive
clearly
to
-
day
that
Rousseau had no conception
of
the effects
of
education
,
of
"
in-
herited drill
,"
and of the innumerable
other
causes
that
have
modified human
beings
in
society
.
He fondly believed
that by
renouncing cultivated
life and abolishing
civil institutions
,
which
have
overlaid
but
not
effaced
man's essential
attributes
,
a
fresh
start might be made towards
a
nobler mode
of
existence
,
a
new
nc and loftier social order
.
To exhibit
in
detail the discrepancies
between
Rousseau's
account
of
primitive
man and the conclusions
of recent
anthropology
is
hardly
necessary
.
The humble
method
of
inductive enquiry
was alien
to
him
,
and he would
doubtless
have
preferred
the
"
high
a
priori road
,"
even
if
our present
scientific information
had been
available
.
Such
glimpses
as
can
be obtained
of
prehistoric
men
,
together with accurate
observa-
tions
of
savage
life
,
reveal
great
differences
among
uncivilised
men
in
mental
,
moral
,
and physical
qualities
,
assignable
to
such
various
causes
as
race
,
climate
,
geographical
position
,
war
,
super-
stition
,
etc.
Barbarians
are not isolated like Rousseau's primitive
men
,
but members
of
tribes
subject
to
the
authority
of
chiefs

they are neither simple

nor peaceful

nor free

Progress
is only effected by
Do
overcoming
nature , by substituting
reasoned
knowledge
for the
promptings
of instinct, and by protecting
the weak through
com-
mon action .
Rousseau , it is true , does not definitely
affirm
that
the state of nature was a historical
condition, though
he suggests
it more strongly
here than
in the
Social
Contract .
In any
case
his
description
is wholly
at
variance
with
ascertained
facts .
Instinctive gregariousness , natural
affection , and
a perception
of
utility were far more influential in the formation
of society than
any of the factors that he enumerates .
But Rousseau's
chief aim was to furnish
a theoretical
basis for
his practical
teaching .
In whatever light we may regard his work,
it served his purpose of contrasting
a simple , unsophisticated
mode
of
existence
with
the
artificiality
and
corruption
of
modern
Europe.
His
picture
of
an
Arcadian
paradise
in
which
all
natural
wants
were
supplied
,
together
with his
denunciation
of
property
,
privileges
,
and tyranny
,
fascinated
a
people that groaned
under the exactions
of
an extravagant
court
,
a
bigoted
priesthood
,
and
a
luxurious
nobility
.
The
third
estate
,
enslaved
and
im-
poverished
,
had no lively appreciation
of
a
boasted
civilisation
which included among its institutions
lettres
de
cachet
,
the
taille
,
the gabelle
,
and the corvées
,
and under which the workers
,
attenu-
ated with hunger
and clothed
in
rags
,
languished
in
ruined hovels
.
They yearned for
a
millennium
in
which property
and
all
other
causes
of
inequality should
be removed
,
and the poor and down-
trodden should
resume
their rightful inheritance
.
It
was this
gospel that Rousseau
preached
with
all the
fervour
of
a
Jesus
.
The
free
citizen
of
Geneva
had
lived
among the poor
,
and his
sensitive
and passionate
nature was profoundly touched
by their
sufferings and wrongs
.
Above the witty talk and gay laughter of
the salons
he
heard
the
piercing
cry
of
humanity
;
and
with
passion
,
clearness
,
and
force
he
proclaimed
deliverance
from
a
servile yoke
.

-h.
The Émile was designed
to exhibit
the fittest
mode
of training
the young from
infancy to manhood.
This
is the first step
towards
any effectual rehabilitation
of human
nature .
That man
has
degenerated
from
his primordial virtue
is the
keynote
of the
book ; and the redemption
of fallen man is the
problem
for the
sometime
Calvinist.
The
present
system of education
produces
only " double
men ," having neither
the independence
of natural
an men , nor the
complete
dependence
of citizens .
The natural
man is a unit, a whole ; the
citizen
is but a fraction
of the body
politic .
Further, the natural and social
states are opposed , good
social institutions
being
those which most distort
human
nature ;
and he who wishes to be both a man and a citizen will be neither .
In
society wisdom
consists
in servile
prejudices
; all our customs
are merely
subjection
and
restraint .
The
citizen
is born , lives ,
and dies in slavery ;
and
established
social
distinctions
simply
represent
the triumph of the strong over the weak , of the
unjust
over the good .
Nevertheless
, a father
owes
men to the race ,
sociable
men to society , and citizens
to the State .
Although ,
then, civic education
is secondary
compared
with domestic
edu-
cation , Rousseau
decides
to treat of it, and thus attempts to solve
a problem
which he had at first declared
insoluble
.
A combined
study of the principles
of political right
on the lines of the Social
Contract , and of the
positive
law of established
governments
as
set
forth
by Montesquieu
, is
essential to a sound
judgment on

existing
governments .
Great
talents are less necessary here
than
a sincere love of justice
and truth .
Our elements shall be simple ,
clear , and
derived
immediately
from the nature of things. If it
be contended
that our political
structure
is too
regular , the reply
is that right must
not
adapt
itself to men's
passions , but
con-
versely .
In several
important
particulars
the Émile differs from
the second
Discourse .
Rousseau
admits , in the fifth book , that
man
is
naturally
sociable , or
at least
made to become
so ; and
that the citizen , though
less free , is far nobler
than the primitive
man .
In his
Confessions
Rousseau
remarked
with
reference
to
his
experiences
at Venice, that existing
civil institutions
are opposed
to justice and the true welfare of the people , and
that they " add
the sanction
of public authority to the oppression
of the weak
and
the iniquity of the strong ."
His
meditations
on the defects
of the Venetian
Republic led
him to project
an
extensive work
on
Political
Institutions
( 1756 ).
Holding
with
Montesquieu ,
Mably , and
Morelly that
the
character
of a people
depends
on
the
nature
of
its
government , he
determined
to
enquire
what
government
is best fitted to form the wisest
and
most virtuous
nation , and to investigate
the
related
problems , what law is and
what government
by its nature
always keeps
nearest to the law .
The Social
Contract
was the
most
considerable
fragment
of this
partially
executed work .
Certain
passages in the Émile ( Book V.)
suggest that the subjects to be dealt with in Political Institutions
were the rights and duties of citizens , the true characteristics
of a
fatherland , a
comparison
of civil
societies , and
an
account
of
their mutual
relations , with especial
reference to the formation
of federal
States .
A few dissertations
on Laws, Religion , etc.,
discovered
at Neuchâtel , appear to be fragments of this work .
The Social Contract
has, perhaps , little claim to originality as
regards
its
matter
;
but the borrowed
doctrines
are presented
in
a
striking form
.
Rousseau's
chief
source
was Locke's
second
Treatise on Government
,
and
,
in
his Letters from the Mountain
,
he
frankly admitted
that he had treated the same subjects
on exactly
the same principles
as
Locke
.

To Hobbes also Rousseau
was greatly
indebted , especially
for his accurate
account
of the
attributes
of
sovereignty
and for his doctrine of the complete
subordination
of the ecclesiastical
to the
civil power .

ably described
his theory
as
"
a
curious
fusion
between
the
pre-
misses and the temper
of
Hobbes and the conclusions
of
Locke
.
This fusion produced
that popular
absolutism
of which the Social
Contract
was the theoretical
expression
,
and Jacobin
supremacy
the
practical
manifestation
.
Rousseau
borrowed
from Hobbes
the true conception
of
sovereignty
,
and from Locke the true con-
ception
of
the ultimate
seat and original
of
authority
,
and
of
the
two together
he made the great image
of
the sovereign
people
.”
Of the ancient
philosophers
Plato
and
Aristotle
most
strongly
influenced
him
.
His unbounded
admiration
for Sparta
and the
Roman
Republic
is
perpetually
displayed
,
and
was the fruit of
his uncritical
study
of
Plutarch
,
Livy
,
and
Tacitus
.
Rousseau
was
in
a
less
degree
affected
by Machiavelli
,
Bodin
,
Grotius
,
Puffendorf
,
Althusius
,
Algernon Sidney
,
and
Fénélon
.†
Among
his
immediate
predecessors
and
contemporaries
,
he
owed
most
to
D'Argenson
,
the Abbé
de
Saint
-
Pierre
,
Voltaire
,
Mably
,
and
Morelly
,
while
from
Montesquieu he
derived
many
details
and
philosophical principles
.
The French
lawyers
with their theory
of natural
law must also have contributed
to
the numerous
forces
acting on his
receptive
mind
.
M.
Vuij

en-
deavoured

show that Rousseau's
conception
of
sovereignty
was
