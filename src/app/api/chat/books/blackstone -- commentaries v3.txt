REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS
BY THE
ACT
OF THE
PARTIES .
Ar the opening
of these Commentaries (a ) municipal
law was in general defined
to be, " a rule of civil conduct ,
• prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding
what
is right , prohibiting
what
is wrong (b) , and regu-
lating matters in themselves indifferent ."
Hence
there-
fore it followed , that the primary
objects of our law are
the establishment of rights , and the prohibition
of wrongs .
And this occasioned the
distribution
of these
collections
into two general heads ( c) ; under the former of which we
have considered
the rights
that were defined

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS
Wrongs are
private or
public.
The redress
for a private
parties
by operation
suit or ac-
blished , and under the latter we are now to consider the
wrongs , including torts and breaches of contract , that are
forbidden , and redressed by the laws of England.
Wrongs are divisible
into two sorts or species
; private
wrongs , and public wrongs .
A private wrong
is
an in-
fringement
or privation
of some private
or civil right
belonging
to an individual , and may be termed
a civil
injury
a public wrong
is
a breach and violation of some
public right and duty , which affects
the whole community
;
and is distinguished
by the harsher appellation of a crime .
To investigate
the first of these
species of wrongs , with
the remedies appropriate
thereto , will be our employment
in
the
present
Book ;
and the
other
species
will be
reserved till the next or concluding
Volume .
The more effectually to accomplish the redress of private
wrong is by injuries , courts of justice
are instituted
in every civilized
themselves, society, in order to protect the weak from the insults of
of
law
,
or
by
the
stronger
,
by expounding
and enforcing
those laws
,
tion
.
by which rights are defined
,
and wrongs prohibited
.
This
remedy
is
therefore principally
to
be sought by applica-
tion
to
these courts
of
justice
;
that
is
,
by civil suit
or
action
.
For which
reason our chief employment
in
this
Volume will be
to
consider the redress of private wrongs
,
by suit
or
action
in
court
.
But
as
there
are
certain
injuries
of
such
a
nature
,
that
some
of
them furnish
and
others require
a
more
speedy
remedy
,
than can be had by
the ordinary forms
of
justice
,
there
is
allowed
in
any such
case
an extrajudicial
or
eccentrical kind
of
remedy
;
of
which
I
shall
first treat
,
before considering
the several
remedies by suit and action
:
and
,
to
that end
,
shall dis-
tribute
the
redress
of
private wrongs into three several
species
:
first
,
that which
is
obtained by the mere act
of
the parties
themselves
;
secondly
,
that which
is
effected
by the mere act and operation of law
;
and
,
thirdly
,
that
which
arises from
suit
,
action
,
or
other
proceeding
in
court
,
and consists
in
a
conjunction
of
the
other two
,
the
act
of
the parties
co
-
operating with the act
of
law
.


BY ACT
OF THE
PARTIES .
3
act of the
And , first of that redress
of private
injuries , which is Redressby
obtained by the mere act of the parties .
This is of two parties.
.sorts ; I. That which
arises
from the act of the injured
party only ; and , II. That which
arises from the joint act
of all the parties together .
I. Of the former
sort , or that which
arises from
the I. By sole
sole act of the injured party , is,

fence.
1. The
defence
of one's
self , or the
mutual
and reci-
1. Self-
de-
procal defence
of
each other by husband
and wife
,
parent
and child
,
master and servant
(d).
For
if
the party him-
self
,
or
any one
thus related
to
him
,
be
forcibly
attacked
in
person
or
property
,
it
is
lawful for him
to
repel force
by force
;
and the breach
of
the peace
,
which happens
,
is
chargeable upon him only who began the affray
(e).
The law
,
in
this case
,
respects
the passions
of
the human
mind
;
and
(
when
external
violence
is
offered
to
a
man
himself
,
or
one
to
whom he bears
so
near
a
connexion
)
makes
it
lawful in him to do himself that immediate
justice
,
to
which
he
is
prompted
by nature
,
and which
no
prudential
motives
are strong
enough
to
restrain
.
The
future
process
of
law may be by
no
means an
adequate
remedy for an injury accompanied with force
;
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
,
to
what
wanton
lengths
of
rapine
or
cruelty
an
outrage
of
this sort might
be
carried
,
unless
it
were permitted
a
man immediately
to
oppose one violence
with another
.
Self
-
defence
,
therefore
,
as
it
is
justly called
the primary law
of
nature
,
so
is
not
,
neither
can
it
be
in
fact
,
taken
away by the law
of
society
.
In the English
law particularly
it
is
sometimes held
to
furnish
an
excuse
for
a
breach
of
the peace
,
nay even for homicide itself
(ƒ
)
;
but care must be taken
,
that the resistance
does
not

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS
2. Recap-
tion.
ceed the bounds of mere defence
and prevention ; for then
the defender would himself become
an aggressor .
2.
Recaption or reprisal
is another species of remedy by
the mere act of the party injured .
This happens , when
any one has deprived another
of his property in goods or
chattels
personal , or wrongfully
detains one's wife , child ,
or servant
in which
case the owner of the goods , the
husband , parent , or master , may lawfully claim and retake
such property
or person , wherever
found
;
so it be not
in
a riotous
manner , or
attended with a breach of the
peace (g).
The reason for which is obvious ;
since the
owner may have this
only
opportunity
of doing himself
justice
his goods might be afterwards
conveyed
away or
destroyed ; and his wife , child , or servant ,
concealed
or
carried out of his reach ; if he had no
speedier remedy
than the ordinary
process of law.
If therefore
where
personal
property
has
been forcibly taken
its
rightful
owner can
so
contrive
as
to
regain
possession
of
it
,
with-
out violence
or
terror
,
the law favours and will justify his
proceeding
().
But
as
the
public
peace
must
be
con-
sidered rather than any one man's right
of
property
;
and
as
,
if
individuals
were
once allowed
to
use private force
as
a
remedy for private injuries
,
all social justice
must cease
,
the
strong
would
give law
to
the weak
,
and every man
would revert
to
a
state
of
nature
;
for these reasons
it
is
provided
,
that this natural
right
of
recaption shall never
be exerted
,
where such exertion
must
occasion
strife and
bodily contention
,
or
endanger the
peace
of
society
.
If
,
for instance
,
my horse
is
taken away
,
and
I
find him on
a
common
,
at
a
fair
,
or
at
a
public inn

may lawfully seize

for
an injury to real
property
is sometimes
permitted by entry on lands and tenements , when another
person without
any right has taken
or retains possession
thereof .
This
depends in
some
measure on like reasons
with the former
; and like that too must be peaceable and
without
force or violence which might endanger the public
peace .
There is some nicety
required
in
defining
and
distinguishing
circumstances in which
such entry might
be lawful or otherwise ;
and
especially
in
determining
whether notice should be given
before re -entry and evic-
tion to the person who is wrongfully in possession (k) .

species
of remedy by the mere act of the 4. Abate-
party injured , is the abatement , or removal of a nuisance . nuisance.
What
a nuisance is, we shall
find a more proper
place
hereafter to inquire .
At present we may
observe
gene-
rally, that whatsoever unlawfully annoys or does damage
to another , is a nuisance ; and such nuisance may some-
times
be abated , that
is , taken
away or removed , by the
party aggrieved thereby , so
as he commits
no riot in the
doing of it (7) .
If a wall is erected
so near to my house.
that it stops my ancient lights , which is a private nuisance ,
I may enter my neighbour's
land , and peaceably pull it
down .
Likewise if a bar
or gate be wrongfully erected
across the public highway , which is
a common nuisance ,
any of the queen's subjects passing that way may , if neces-
sary for the exercise of that right , cut it down and destroy

it (m ) .
And the
reason why the law allows this private
and summary method of doing one's selfjustice , is because
injuries of this kind , which obstruct
or annoy such things
as are of daily convenience and use, require an immediate
remedy ;
and
cannot wait
for
the slow progress of the
ordinary forms ofjustice .
Before proceeding to abate
a nuisance , a notice to re-
move it is sometimes requisite (»).
5. A fifth
case , in which the law allows a man to be his
own avenger, or to minister
redress to himself, is that of
distress , whether
for
rent in arrear or damage feasant ,
which has been noticed in our preceding volume .
6. The seizing of a heriot when due on the death of a
tenant
is
another species
of self-remedy , likewise already
noticed (0).
II.
Such being the several
remedies which
may be had
by the mere act of the party injured ,
those will next be
mentioned which arise from the joint act of all the parties .
1.
Accord and satisfaction
as between the party injuring
and the party injured , will bar an action for
such injury.
If a man contract to build a house or deliver a horse , and
fail in it ; for this breach of contract the sufferer may have
his remedy by action ; but if he accept a sum of money ,
or other thing,
as a satisfaction , this
may operate
as a
redress of his grievance , and entirely
take away his right

2. Arbitration is where the parties , injuring and injured ,
submit matters in dispute , concerning
any personal
chat-
tel or personal
wrong , to the judgment
of two or more
arbitrators , who are to decide the controversy ; and if they
do not agree , it is usual
to add, that another person be
called in as umpire
( imperator or impar (r)) , to whose sole
judgment it is then referred (s) :
or one arbitrator
may be
originally appointed .
The
decision , in
any such
case , is
called an award .
And , if the award stands , the question
is thereby as fully determined , and the right , which was in
contest, transferred or settled , as it could have been by the
agreement of the parties
or the judgment
of a court of
justice .
The right to real property , however , could not for-
merly have thus passed by a mere award (t) : which subtilty
had its rise from
feudal
principles
; for if this
had
been
permitted , the land might have been
aliened
collusively
without the
consent of the
superior .
But an arbitrator
may now award a conveyance or a release
of land ; and it
will be a breach of the arbitration -bond to refuse compli-
ance (u) .
For though originally the submission
to arbi-
tration used to be by word or in writing , yet both of these
being revocable in their nature , it became
a common prac-
tice for the parties to enter into mutual bonds , with
con-
ditions to stand to the
award of the arbitrators
therein
named .
And
experience having
shown the great use of
these
peaceable
and domestic tribunals , especially in mat-
ters of account , and other mercantile
transactions , which
may be difficult of adjustment on a trial at law, the legis-

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS
00
lature has by several statutes sanctioned the use of arbitra-
tions as well in controversies depending in court , as in those
where no action has been brought .
By 9 & 10 Will . 3 , c.
15 , it was enacted , that all merchants and others , desirous
of ending any controversy , suit , or quarrel (for which there
is no
other
remedy but by personal
action
or
suit
in
equity), may agree , that
their
submission
of the suit to
arbitration
or umpirage
shall
be made a rule of court ,
and may insert such agreement in their
submission , or in
the condition of the arbitration -bond (x) : which agreement
being proved upon oath by one of the witnesses thereto ,
the court
shall
make
a rule
that
such
submission
and
award shall be conclusive ; and , after such rule
made , the
parties disobeying the award shall be liable to be punished ,
as for a contempt of the court ; unless
such award be set
aside for corruption or other misbehaviour
in the arbitra-
tors or umpire (y) , proved on oath to the court , within one
term
after the
award is made.
Under this statute , the
superior courts interfered
to set aside awards when
par-
tially
or illegally
made ;
or to
enforce
their execution ,
when legal , by process of contempt .
By the above
statute , however, of 9
& 10 Will .
3 , a
parol submission could not be made a rule of court , and the
remedy by arbitration
still remained defective ; for a party
might at any time before the award was made, or after it
was made, but before the agreement was
made a rule of
court , revoke his submission , a power which was frequently
exercised where
one of the
parties
had by some means
ascertained that
the arbitrator
was unfavourably
disposed
towards him.
Besides this , an arbitrator
had no power to
compel the
attendance of a witness , or to administer
an
oath to him ; and therefore if a witness on either side was

unwilling to give evidence
, it was not safe to consent to
an arbitration , and the evidence
being given without the
sanction of an oath , the proceeding by arbitration
was less
satisfactory than
that before a jury .
It was accordingly
deemed
expedient
yet further
to extend and improve
the
remedy by arbitration , and several provisions contained in
the statute 3 & 4 Will . 4 , c. 42 , were
directed to this ob-
ject.
By sect. 39 , it was provided that if the submission
contained an agreement that it should be made a rule of
court , it should
not be revocable without
leave of the
court or a judge .
By sect. 40 , the court
or a judge was
empowered to command the attendance and examination
of any person, or the production
of any document ; and
sect . 41 enabled the arbitrators
or
umpire
to administer
an oath , and has subjected a witness wilfully giving false
evidence
, in the matter of an arbitration , to the penalties
of perjury .
Other
material
improvements
have been made in the
law of arbitrations , by the statute 17 & 18 Vict . c. 125 , as
well by amending
the
pre -existing
law upon
this sub-
ject (z), as by enabling the court or a judge to compel a
reference to arbitration
either before or at the time of trial ,
where the matter in dispute consists , wholly
or in part , of
items
of mere
account ,
which
cannot
conveniently
be
tried (a).
Under the provisions first alluded to, an action
commenced by one of the parties to the reference after all
have agreed thereto may
be stayed (b) , where the parties
cannot concur in the appointment of an arbitrator , he may
be appointed upon summons by a judge (c) ; where the re-
ference is to two arbitrators , and one party fails
to appoint ,
the other party may appoint an arbitrator
to act alone (d) ,
and the award , unless when otherwise
agreed
or ordered,
is to be made within three months , if the term for making

CHAPTER II.
REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS BY THE
OPERATION
OF LAW .
THE remedies for private wrongs , which
are effected
by
the mere operation of law, will fall within
a very narrow
compass
the principal are these , known
as , I.
Retainer ,
(where a creditor is made executor or administrator
to his
debtor).
II. Set -off.
III.
Remitter , to which may be
added , IV., the effect of the marriage of parties in certain
cases .
I. If a person indebted to another makes his creditor or I. Retainer.
debtee his executor (a) , or if such creditor
obtains letters
of administration
(b) to his debtor ; in these cases the law
gives him a remedy for his debt , by allowing him to retain
so much
as will pay himself, before any other
creditors
whose debts are of equal degree .
This is a remedy by the
mere act of law, and grounded upon this reason ; that the
executor cannot , without an apparent absurdity , commence
a suit against himself as representative of the deceased , to
recover that which is due to him in his own private
capa-
city : but , having the whole personal estate in his hands ,
so much as is sufficient to answer his own demand is , by
operation of law, applied to that particular
purpose .
Else ,
by being made executor
, he would be put in a worse con-
dition than all the rest of the world
besides .
For , though
a rateable payment of all the
debts
of the
deceased , in
equal degree , is clearly the most equitable method , yet as

v. Darcy, Plowd . 184.

REDRESS

every scheme for a proportionable
distribution
by an exe-
cutor or administrator , of the assets among all the credi-
tors has been hitherto found to be impracticable , and pro-
ductive of more mischiefs than it would
remedy ;
so that
the creditor who first commences
his suit is entitled
to a
preference in payment ; it follows , that
as the executor
can commence no suit , he must be paid the
last of any ,
and of course
must lose his debt, in case the estate of his
testator should
prove insolvent , unless he be allowed
to
retain it.
The doctrine
of retainer is therefore the neces-
sary consequence
of that
other
doctrine
of the law, the
priority of such creditor who first commences his
action .
But the
executor shall not retain
his
own debt, in pre-
judice to those of a higher
degree
; for the law only puts
him in the same situation , as if he had
sued
himself as
executor , and recovered his debt ; which he never could be
supposed to have done, while
debts of a higher
nature
subsisted .
Neither
shall one executor be allowed to retain
his
own
debt , in prejudice
to that of his
co-executor in
equal
degree
; but
both shall be discharged
in
propor-
tion (c).
Nor shall an executor of his own wrong be per-
mitted to retain (d) , except in the case where he
becomes
so (e) through
accepting
a gift of the intestate's
effects
from an administrator
who has obtained the grant fraudu-
lently.
Whether an executor might retain
for a debt
barred by the statute was formerly
in some doubt ; recent
decisions , which may be accepted
as settling the question ,
have established the right in this case also (ƒ) .

The doctrine was not

however

voluntarily
accepted
by
our courts of common law
,
and
in
early times its benefit
could only
be
obtained
in
courts
of
equity where
it
seems
to
have been always recognised
(i).
The obviously disas-

consequences
of
not admitting

of

of

led
to
its
recog-
nition by the legislature
in
that case
(k).

afterwards
the

authority
interfered
to
permit
a

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE WRONGS
There are various rules and conditions which
regulate the
application
of the doctrine , into which we cannot appro-
priately
enter here at any length .
They depend upon the
nature of the relation
existing
between the
parties
and
the character of the conflicting
claims .
Thus where the
claims are in different
rights
(m) , or where
one is for un-
liquidated
damages or for tort , the other being a common
debt of fixed
amount (n), or where the debt in respect
of which set-off is claimed
accrued after the
commence-
ment of the action (0) , no set -off will be allowed , and it
would seem that set -off may not be asserted
in respect of
a debt barred by the Statutes of Limitations (p).
Courts
of equity , having
a wider
cognisance of rights
and claims
than
courts of law,
are still (q)

may retain

produced
by sale of
the mortgaged
properties more than
six years ' interest , notwithstanding
3 & 4 Will . 4,

And
in the case of a legacy to a debtor
whose debt is barred , it is now quite
established
that the executor
may
set off the
legacy against
the debt ,

this
takes place whatever may be his will or intention .
He is remitted
nolens
volens (x).
If the
subsequent
estate ,
or
right of
possession , be
gained by a man's own act or consent , as by immediate
purchase being of full age , he shall not be remitted .
For
the taking such subsequent estate was his own folly , and
shall
be looked
upon
as
a waiver of his prior right (y).
Therefore it is to be observed
, that to every remitter
there
are regularly
these incidents ; an ancient right , and a new
defeasible estate of freehold in possession, uniting in one
and the same person ; which defeasible estate must be cast
upon the rightful owner not gained by his own act : except,
indeed , in the case of an infant or married woman , against
whom the law will not adjudge folly (~) .
The reason given
by Littleton (a) , why
this
remedy ,
which
operates
silently , and involuntarily, by the mere
act of law, was allowed , is somewhat similar to that given
for retainer ;
because
otherwise he who hath right would
be deprived of
all
remedy
.
For
as
he
himself
is
the person
in
possession
of
the
freehold
,
there
is
no other person
against
whom
he
can bring an
action
,
to
establish his
prior right
.
And for this cause the law doth adjudge him
in
by remitter
;
that
is
,
in
such plight
as
if
he
had lawfully
recovered the
same land by suit
.
For
,
as
Lord
Bacon
observes
(b),
the benignity
of
the law
is
such
,
as
when
,
to
preserve the principles
and grounds
of
law
,
it
depriveth
a
man
of
his
remedy without his
own fault
,
it
will rather
put him
in
a
better degree and condition
than
in

BY OPERATION
OF LAW.
17
under the law as it stood prior to the act abolishing
fines ,
the issue in tail had been barred by the fine of his ancestor
and the freehold was afterwards
cast upon
him ; he was
not remitted
to his
estate
tail (e) :
for the operation of
the remitter
is exactly the same, after the union of the
two
rights,
as that of a real
action
would
have
been
before it.
As therefore
the
issue in tail could not by
any action
have
recovered
his
ancient
estate , he
could
not recover it by remitter .
Of
course under
the
pre-
sent law
there
can
be
no
remitter
to
an
estate
tail
barred
by a disentailing
assurance duly executed
by the
ancestor.
Inasmuch
as the possession of one coparcener,
joint tenant , or tenant in common is not the possession of
any other (ƒ) , therefore if one be remitted to any of these
estates
no advantage accrues
to any other (g).

IV.
Besides the
remedies
of
retainer , remitter , and
set-off, we may here mention
another
mode whereby
right may be extinguished
by operation of law, and so in
a manner
a wrong may be considered as redressed
. If a
woman marry
her creditor
or debtor , in either
case the
debt is absolutely
extinguished (h) .
The
debt , however ,
must be one which , if existing , would
be payable during
the coverture , otherwise it is not
extinguished
; for in-
stance, if a bond
be given to a woman in contemplation
of her marriage
with the obligor , conditioned
to
pay a
sum of money
to her
or
her
representatives
after
the
obligor's death , this bond would be valid , notwithstanding
the marriage (1) .

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE WRONGS .
Conclusion.
And thus much for these extrajudicial
remedies , as well
for real as personal
injuries , which
are furnished
or per-
mitted
by the law, where the parties
are so peculiarly
circumstanced , as not to make it eligible , or in some
cases
even possible , to apply for redress
in the usual and ordinary
methods to the courts of public justice .


CHAPTER III.
COURTS IN
GENERAL .
suit in
THE
next ,
and principal,
object
of our
inquiries
is Redressby
redress by suit in court : wherein
the act of the parties court.
and the act of law co -operate
; the act of the parties being
necessary to set the law in motion , and the process
of the
law being in, general the only instrument
by which
the
parties
are enabled
to procure
a
certain
and
adequate
redress .
And
here it will
not
be
improper
to
observe , that
although in the several cases of redress
by the act of the
parties mentioned in a former
chapter (a) , the law allows
an extrajudicial
remedy , yet that
remedy is not compul-
sory , and does not exclude the ordinary
course of justice
:
it is only an
additional
weapon put into
the
hands of
persons in particular
instances , where natural
equity or
the
peculiar
circumstances
of their
situation
require
a
more expeditious
remedy , than the
formal
process
of a
court of judicature
can furnish .
Therefore , though I may
defend myself from external violence , I yet am afterwards
entitled
to an action of assault
and battery : though I
may retake my goods , if I have a fair and peaceable
oppor-
tunity , this power of recaption
does
not debar me from
my action I may either
enter on the lands , on which I
have a right of entry , or may demand possession
by action :
I may either
abate
a nuisance by my own
authority , or
call upon the law to do it for me : I may distrain for rent ,

or have an action of debt , at my own option : if I do not
distrain
my
neighbour's
cattle
damage-feasant , I
may
compel him by action to make me a fair satisfaction for
the damage done ; if a heriot be withheld
from
me by
fraud or force , I may recover it though I never seized it.
And with regard
to
accords
and arbitrations
, either
of
these, being in its nature
merely an agreement or com-
promise , indisputably
supposes
a previous right of obtain-
ing redress some other way ; which
is given up by such
agreement .
And as to remedies by operation of law, those
are indeed given , because
no remedy can be administered
by suit
or
action , without running into the
palpable
absurdity of a man's bringing an action against himself :
the two
cases wherein
they happen being
such , that the
only
possible
legal
remedy would
have to be directed
against the very person who seeks relief.
Otherwise , however , it is
a rule , that where there is a
legal right , there is a legal remedy , by suit in court or by
application
to a court of justice , whenever that right is
invaded .
And in treating
of such remedy , I shall
now
consider the nature of courts in general ; and shall after-
wards inquire
as to the
several
species
of
courts , the
jurisdiction of
each , and the method of obtaining
the
redress which it affords .
A court is defined
to
be a place wherein justice is
judicially administered ( b) .
And , as by our constitution
the
sole
executive
power
of the laws
is
vested
in the
person of the sovereign , courts of justice , which
are the
medium by which
he administers
the laws , are
derived
from the power of the crown (c) .
For , whether
created
by act of parliament , or letters patent , or subsisting
by
prescription
(the
only
methods
by which any
court of
judicature
can exist (d)) , the
royal
consent in the
two
former
is expressly , and in the latter is impliedly , given .

COURTS
OF RECORD .
21
In these courts the sovereign is supposed
in contemplation
of law to be always
present ;
or at least is there
repre-
sented by the judges , whose power
is but an emanation
of the prerogative .
A ofrecord ;
For the more
speedy
and impartial
administration
of
justice between subject and subject , the law has appointed
various
courts , some with a more limited , others with a
more extensive jurisdiction ; some constituted
to inquire
only, others to hear and determine ;
some to determine in
the first instance , others upon appeal.
These will be taken
notice of in their respective places : and here one distinc-
tion only that runs throughout
them need be noticed ; viz .
between courts of record
and courts
not of record .
court of record is that , whose acts and judicial proceedings
are enrolled
for
a perpetual
memorial
and testimony
:
which rolls
are called the records of the court , and are of
such high and super-eminent
authority , that their
truth
is not to be called
in question .
For it is
a settled
rule
and maxim that nothing
shall be averred against a record ,
nor shall
any plea , or even
proof , unless where fraud is
involved ,
be
admitted
to the
contrary (e) .
And if the
existence of a record be denied , it shall be tried by nothing
but itself : that
is ,
upon
bare
inspection whether
there
be any such record
or no ;
else
there would
be no end
of disputes .
But , if there
appear any
mistake
of the
clerk
in
making
up such
record ,
the
court
will
di-
rect him to amend it.
All courts of record
are said to
be the queen's courts , in right of her crown
and royal
dignity (f) ,
and no other
court has authority
to fine or
imprison
for a contempt
;
so that
the very erection of
a new jurisdiction with such power makes it a court of
record (g).

to
a manor ,
where the proceedings
are not enrolled
or recorded ; but
as well their existence as the truth of the matters therein
contained may , if disputed , be tried and determined by a
jury .
In every court there must be three constituent parts , the
actor, reus, and judex : the actor, or plaintiff, who com-
plains of an injury done ; the reus, or defendant , who
is
called upon to make satisfaction for it ; and the judex, or
judicial power , whose duty it is to examine the
truth of
the fact , to determine the law arising upon that fact , and ,
if any injury appears
to have been done, to ascertain , and
by its officers
to apply the remedy.
It is also usual in a
court of justice
to have attornies or solicitors , and advo-
cates or counsel , as assistants .
An attorney at law, or a solicitor , answers to the procu-
rator , or proctor , of the civilians
and canonists (h) , and is
one put in the place , stead , or turn of another , to manage
his matters of law.
Formerly every suitor was obliged to
appear in person, to prosecute or defend his suit , unless
by
special
licence
under
the
king's
letters
patent (¿) .
And an idiot
cannot at this
day appear by attorney , but
must
do so in person (k), for he has not
discretion
to
enable him to appoint
a proper substitute .
But , as in the
Roman law, " cum olim in usu fuisset , alterius nomine agi
non posse, sed, quia hoc non minimam incommoditatem
habe-
bat, cæperunt homines
per procuratores
litigare " (1) ,
so
with us, upon
the
same
principle
of convenience, it was
permitted
in general , by divers
ancient
statutes , whereof
the first was statute Westm.

Lord
Keeper
of the Great Seal to King Charles II. ( s) .
These
queen's counsel answer , in some measure, to the advocates
of the revenue, advocati fisci, among the Romans .
For
they must not be employed in any cause against the crown
without
special
licence : in
which
restriction
they agree
with the advocates
of the fisc (t) : but in the imperial law
the prohibition
was carried still further , and perhaps was
more for the dignity of the
sovereign ;
for ,
excepting
some peculiar
causes , the fiscal
advocates were not per-
mitted to be at all concerned
in private suits between sub-
ject and subject (u) .
A custom has for many years
pre-
vailed of granting letters
patent of precedence
to
such
barristers , as the crown thinks proper to honour with that
mark
of distinction
: whereby
they are
entitled
to
such
rank and pre-audience as are assigned in their respective
patents.
These ,
as well
as the
attorney
and solicitor-
general (2) , rank promiscuously
with the king's counsel ,
and together with them sit within the bar of the respec-
tive courts ; but receive no salaries , and
are
not sworn ;
and therefore are at liberty to be retained in causes against
the crown .
And all other serjeants and barristers
indis-
criminately
may take upon themselves the protection
and
defence of suitors , who are therefore called their
clients ,
as were the dependants upon the ancient
Roman
orators .
Those indeed practised
gratis , for honour
merely , or at
most for the sake of gaining
influence : and
so likewise
it is established with us, that a counsel can maintain
no
action for his
fees ;

or hire , but as a mere gratuity , which a counsellor
cannot
demand without
doing wrong to his reputation (y) ; as is
also laid down with regard to advocates
in the civil law (≈) ,
whose honorarium was directed by a decree
of the
senate
not to exceed in any case ten thousand
sesterces , or about
801. of English money (a).
A counsel accordingly
is to be considered not as making
a contract with
his client , which
he is incapacitated
from
doing (6) , but as taking upon himself an office or duty in
the proper discharge of which
not merely his client , but
the court in which
the duty is to be performed , and the
public at large have an interest .
The general conduct of,
and control
over, the cause
are necessarily left to counsel ,
and he has complete authority
over the suit , the mode of
conducting it, and all that is incident
to it ; but not over
matters
collateral
thereto (c).

in
order
to
encourage due freedom of speech in the lawful
defence of

unseemly
licentiousness
of

may
sometimes

held
that
a
counsel is not
answerable
for
any matter
by him spoken , relative
to the
cause in hand , and sug-
gested in his
client's
instructions
;
although it
should
reflect
upon
the reputation
of another , and
even
prove
absolutely
groundless
: but if he
maliciously
mentions
an untruth of his
own
invention ,
not
pertinent
to
the
cause , he may be liable
to an action at suit of the party

was certainly known to the Roman
emperors , with whom cellor, and
it
originally
seems
to have
signified
a chief scribe or
secretary , who was afterwards an officer, to whose functions
there were gradually
added
several judicial
powers , to-
gether with
a
general
superintendency
over
the
other
officers of the prince .
The Roman Church adopted , amongst other
accessories
of imperial
state , this
office , and hence
every
bishop has
to this day his chancellor , the principal
judge of his con-
sistory
court .
When the
modern
kingdoms
of Europe
were established
upon the ruins of the empire , almost
every state preserved its chancellor , but the jurisdictions
and dignities
varied in the different
states
according
to
their
several constitutions .
In all of them he seems to
have had the
supervision
of charters , letters , and such
other public
instruments
of the crown as were authenti-

THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY ,
cated in the most
solemn manner ; when , therefore , the
use of seals
was adopted, in or about the time of Edward
the Confessor (c) , the custody of the king's great seal was
naturally
entrusted to the chancellor , and with him it has
ever since remained (d).
In the present day , the office of
Lord Chancellor
is created by the mere delivery
of the
great seal into his
custody ;
he thereby
becomes
, with-
out writ or patent , an officer of the greatest weight
and
power of any now subsisting in the kingdom , and supe-
rior in point of precedency to
every
temporal lord , except
the king's
sons , brothers , nephews , and
uncles (e) .
He
is invariably made
a privy
councillor , if not
so
pre-
viously (f) ; he is virtute
officii prolocutor , or mouthpiece
of the House of Lords , whether a peer or not (g) , presiding
as well over
its
legislative
as
its
judicial sittings
.
To him
belongs
the
appointment
of
all
justices
of
the
peace
throughout
the kingdom
.
Being
,
in
early times
,
usually an ecclesiastic
(
for none
else were then capable
of
an office involving much know-
ledge
of
letters
),
and presiding
over the royal
chapel
(
½
),
he became
,
and
is
still
,
in
a
legal point
of
view
,
keeper of
the king's
conscience
.
He
is
also visitor
,
in
right
of
the
king
,
of
all hospitals
and colleges

the king's founda-
tion

patron-
age, in early times , extended to all of the king's livings
whose
annual
value
was 20
marks
or
under , and was
chiefly exercised in favour of the clerks in chancery , who
were
usually
ecclesiastics ( ) :
afterwards ,
the
right
of
presentation , without
any restriction , was assumed by the
chancellors , and livings up to the
value of
207.
in the
king's book
) were included in this right, which has con-
tinued to the present day ; the livings
being in fact now
looked
upon
and dealt with, even by the legislature , as
if the advowsons were
vested
in the Lord Chancellor
as a
corporation .
The Lord Chancellor
is , by the jurisdiction
inherent
to
his
office , the general guardian of all infants , idiots , and
lunatics
(k) , and
has the general
superintendence of all
charitable foundations ().
The duties
arising
from
this
position
of guardianship
and
superintendence
are
now
shared by other judges , and , moreover , have, by recent
legislature , been
lessened
by the
establishment of other
functionaries (m).

In order
to
make
provision
for the augmenta-
tion of the value of the
chancellor's
livings, an
act
has
been
recently
passed to authorise
the lord
chan-
cellor to sell the
advowsons
of cer-
tain livings, the price being applied
in increasing
their value .

a court of
record for
tent, &c.
In addition to all these
functions , the Lord Chancellor
is the chief judge in the Court of Chancery , wherein there
are two courts ; the one ordinary , being a court of common
law, the other extraordinary , being a court of equity (n) ,
The Court
Though the Court of Chancery , in the most ancient times ,
was a court of record , for letters
patent under the great
letters pa
seal were, and are always , recorded in the court (o) , it was
not originally a court where justice was administered ; but
from the very earliest times , out of the Court of Chancery ,
which
has from
this
circumstance
been
called
officina
brevium and officina justitia , there have issued writs under
the great seal directed to the king's justices or the sheriff's
to give such remedy as the occasion
required (p). When the
circumstances
of a case
were similar
to others that had
preceded
it, old established forms were, by the rule of the
court , adopted ; but when new cases
arose , which could
not be dealt with under
any existing
form
of action , in
order to prevent
the harsh or imperfect judgment
which
might
otherwise
ensue ,
a new form of writ
was
sought
for.

The
chief judicial
employment
of the
chancellor
in
these
very
early
times , therefore , must
have
been in
devising , with
the
assistance of his
clerks , new
writs
directed to the courts of common law, to give remedy in
cases where none was before administered (t) .
To quicken
the diligence of the clerks in chancery , who were supposed
to be too much
attached to ancient
precedents
, it is pro-
vided by the statute of Westminster
the second ( 13 Edw . Statute of
1 , c. 24) , that " whensoever from thenceforth
a writ shall ster 2.
be found in the chancery , and in a like case falling under
the same right, and requiring
like remedy , no precedent
of a writ can be produced , the clerks in chancery shall
agree in forming a new one : and if they cannot agree , it
shall
be adjourned
to the next
parliament , where a writ
shall be framed by consent of the learned in the law (u),
lest it happen for the future that the court of our lord the
relief was granted was by plaint to
the king, who , with the assistance
of his chancellor or secretary , framed
a writ or letters to the judges : the
most ancient
form of such writ be-
ing as follows
:- " Rex, &c. (to the
judge .)
Questus est nobis . A.
quod
B. , &c., et ideo tibi
(vices nostras in
hac parte committentes) præcipimus

king be deficient in doing justice to the suitors : " and the
statute gives a variety of new precedents of writs ,
some
of them for
cases
previously
unprovided
for .
Thus
is
accounted for the number of writs of trespass on the case
to be met with in the ancient register , whereby the suitor
had relief according to the exigency , and adapted to the
special circumstances and justice of his case (x).
In process of time , however, the chancellor
came to do
more than furnish the first
ingredients of judicial action ;
he always sat as a member of the Aula
Regia , and was
accustomed generally
to attend the king in person for the
purpose ,
amongst
other
things , of giving him
advice ;
indeed , he was doubtless
the principal legal adviser
on
all occasions.
It was natural , therefore , that he should
early take cognizance of some legal
matters , and especi-
ally
those
connected with rights
depending
upon
the
king's grants , since he, being the holder of the great seal,
was the
officer through
whom
they had been obtained .
Thus
arose
the
ancient
common law jurisdiction
of the
tion of
the
chancellor
.
It
is
not possible
to
fix with exactness
the
time when
it
may be said first
to
have been

(d).
Much
of
this jurisdiction
of
the chancellor
seems
but
natural
,
because
,
since the king can never be supposed
to
do any wrong
,
if
any error
be
proved
to
have arisen
.
whereby
a

,
the law
assumes
that
,
on due
proof
of
it
,
he will
give
immediate
redress
,
and
a
conscientious
task like this would
,
of course
,
be
performed
by the
chancellor
,
the
keeper
of
his
con-
science
.
The jurisdiction
of
the court extended over all personal
actions
where
any officer
or
minister
of the court was
a
party
,
over partitions
(
by scire facias
)
of
lands
in
co-
parcenary
(e),
and
,
whilst
military tenures
existed
,
over
claims
for dower where any ward of the court was con-
cerned
in
interest
(ƒ
).
It
afterwards retained jurisdiction
in
cases
relating
to
tithes
of
forest land
,
where granted
by the king
,
and

a

as

THE
COURT
OF CHANCERY .
Ancient
practice of
the Court.
tutes
or recognisances in the
nature of statutes , by the
statute 23 Hen. VIII . , c. 6 ( ).
The proceedings in a suit in the common law court , when
it was more used than is now the case , were not dissimilar
to common law actions elsewhere. If, however , any cause
came to issue , that is, if any fact were disputed between
the parties , the chancellor having no power to summon
a
jury , could not try it (?), he then must
deliver the record
or a transcript of the record , propriâ manu, into the Court
of King's Bench , where it could be tried
by the country ,
and judgment
given thereon (k).
When judgment
was given in chancery upon demurrer
or the like, a writ of error in the nature of an appeal lay
out of this
ordinary
court into the
King's
Bench (1) .
This right of appeal has been so little exercised , how-
ever , that
Sir W.
Blackstone
said that he could find no

(i) The recent Act, 21 & 22 Vict .
c. 27, s. 3, gives the Court of Chan-
cery
power
to
summon
a
jury .
That Act , though
probably
not
in-
tended
to affect
procedure in the
Petty Bag
Office, still , is not in
terms
confined
to the
equity
side
of the
court , and would
therefore ,
seemingly ,
enable
a suit
in the
Petty Bag
Office to be
completely
tried
there .
By the
Chancery
Re-
gulation
Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict .
c.
42) it is made obligatory
upon
the
court
to
decide
questions
of
fact (s. 1),
unless it
can
be
more
conveniently
tried
elsewhere
(s. 2).

law court , one called the Court of the Hanaper , the other
the Court of the Petty Bag . In the former , writs relating
to the business of the subject , and the returns
to them ,
were kept according to the simplicity
of ancient times , in
a hamper (in hanaperio ) .
In the latter , those relating
to
matters wherein the crown was immediately
or mediately
concerned, were
preserved
in a little bag.
The distinction
between the two branches still exists , though
the Petty
Bag is the
branch in which , for obvious
reasons , most
vitality remains .
From it issue writs
of what
may be
called a ministerial
nature , such, for instance ,
as writs of
election issued on calling
a new parliament , writs of congé
d'élire
for the appointment
of bishops
and archbishops .
In the Petty Bag Office, as a court of record, are kept the
records of an
endless
variety
of proceedings , not to be
here enumerated ; the above examples are sufficient illus-
trations of its present duties .
We may add, however , the
inrolment in chancery of deeds , such as disentailing
deeds ,
which forms part of the duties of the common law side of
the court.
The
practice and duties of the officers in the
Petty Bag Office , and of the Inrolment
Office have recently
been regulated by the legislature (n).

THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
persons are hardly , if at all,
aware that the Court of
Chancery possesses
any judicial or administrative
functions
other than its equitable
ones .
Recent
legislation
has so
far modified the practice , and added to the duties of the
equitable side
of the
court ,
that
the
business
trans-
acted by it equals in extent
that of the common
law
courts .
The distinction
between law and equity , as administered
in
different
courts in England , is not at present known ,
and seems not to have ever been
known in other
coun-
tries (o), though
the
difference of one from
the
other ,
when
administered
by the
same
tribunal , was perfectly
familiar to the Romans (p) , the jus prætorium , or discre-
tion of the prætor , being distinct from the leges or stand-
ing laws (q) ; but the power of both centred in one and the
same magistrate , who was equally entrusted to pronounce
the rule of law, and to apply it to particular
cases by the
principles of equity .
With us, too, the Aula Regia , presided over by the chief
justiciar, which was the supreme court of judicature , and
in which all cases of importance were tried , undoubtedly
administered
equal justice
according to the rule of both
law and
equity ,
or
either ,
as
the
case
might
require .
When this
court was broken
up , though
there was
no
formal establishment of a court of equity ,
yet it is pro-
bable that some desire for freedom from
the trammels
of
strict legal
procedure would
often be felt, which

than

THE
EQUITABLE
SIDE .

would
scarcely
be
disregarded .
Still ,
though
Bracton
mentions
equity as a thing
contrasted to strict
law (q) ,
neither
that writer nor Glanvil , nor the author of Fleta,
nor even Britton (who wrote under the auspices , and in
the name of Edward
I. , treating particularly of courts and
their
several jurisdictions ), mentions anything
about the
chancellor's equitable jurisdiction.
Probably
it was with the view of satisfying this
desire
that the statute of Westminster
the
Second was passed,
which , by the
ready issue of suitable
writs , and with a
little elasticity on the part of the judges , might probably
have answered every purpose ;
indeed , opinions
to this
effect have
been
expressed by eminent judges (r) .
The
only real want which might
then have remained unsatis-
fied
would
have
been
that of obtaining
discovery upon
oath from the defendant (s) .
It
seems , however ,
that
notwithstanding
the varied
forms of actions
so
devised , and the means afforded for
further developement , courts of law, through a too rigor-
ous adherence
to established forms , and the
letter rather
than
the spirit of law, still
fell
short
of administering
that complete
relief which
a
natural
sense
of justice
seemed to require .
No satisfactory reason can be given
why this should have been the
case ; certainly in modern
times courts of law do not exhibit the same narrowness of
spirit, and they have long rejected some of the old rigid
rules : still , they have, naturally , been unable in many
instances
entirely
to disregard
the authority
of ancient
precedents, and it is but very recently
that
they
have

THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
received any adequate
aid from the legislature . But , what-
ever may have been the reason , a court of equity was found
to be a necessity , if complete justice was to be obtained .
An important
influence towards
its establishment
came
into operation , when in the 14th century (t) there grew
up
new
doctrines
concerning
the
holding
and
enjoy-
ment of property ,
separating
the
legal title
from
the
right to the beneficial
enjoyment
of it, in imitation
to
some extent of the
usufructus
of
Roman law ,
though
arising
out of
causes
peculiar
to the
age .
With the
growth of these doctrines there arose
a necessity or desire
for the judicial recognition of trusts or uses , as they were
commonly called (u) .
The
device of one
person
having
the legal dominion over property , but bound to allow an-
other to have the full benefit of it , was found to meet and
overcome several
obstacles
which
the law had
imposed
upon the disposition
of landed
property .
Of these , per-
haps , the
most notable was the law of mortmain , pro-
hibiting lands
from
being
given for religious
purposes .
Ecclesiastical
chancellors ,
therefore ,
readily
sanctioned
the plan of avoiding
these statutes , by vesting
the legal
estate
of lands
in
persons to the
use of the
religious
houses , and then , by binding
the conscience
of the legal
owner to give effect to the use.
And since the jurisdiction
to enforce this obligation
was refused by court of law (e),
it was assumed by the Court of Chancery .
The invention
of the writ of subpoena , returnable
only in the Court of
Chancery , by which the feoffee to uses was made account-
(t) 1 Sand . Uses , 12.
(u) It has been commonly thought
that the jurisdiction over trusts was
one of the principal causes of the
equitable jurisdiction being assumed
by the Court
of Chancery .
Lord
Campbell ,
however ,
gives
reasons
for believing
that it did not play so
important
a part in this matter
as
was supposed .
Still it
must
have
had much to do with the determina-
tion with which the chancellors
ad-
hered to their power when once as-
sumed .
See Lord Campbell's
Lives
of the Chancellors , p. 10.
(v) Not, however , without some
occasional
wavering .
See Jeron v.
Bush , 1 Vern. 349, and note

THE
WRIT
OF
SUBPOENA
.
39
able to his cestui que use is ascribed to the " subtilty " of
John de Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury , and chancellor to
Richard II. (x).
This writ, requiring
the defendant
to
appear to and answer a bill of complaint in the Court of
Chancery , continued from that time until very recently , to
be the foundation
of a chancery suit .
It was originally
framed under a strained construction
of the above-quoted
statute of Westminster
the Second
; but the process having
been found
to answer well the ends of those who used
it, the practice of issuing it was
soon
extended to many
cases , even to some which were properly determinable
at
common law ; a false and fictitious
suggestion being made
in the bill that
common law furnished
no
relief .
To re-
medy this , which
was thought
to be an evil , the statute
17 Rich. 2 , c. 6, was passed, by which the chancellor was
directed to award damages
to the party unjustly
vexed by
such a proceeding .
It may be
noticed that the clergy so
early as the reign of King Stephen had attempted to turn
their ecclesiastical courts into courts of equity , by enter-
taining
suits , pro
læsione fidei,
as
a spiritual
offence
against
conscience
, in case
of non -payment of debts
or
breach of civil contract (y) , and these attempts
were
con-
tinued till they were checked by the Constitution
of Cla-
rendon (2), which
declared that " placita

fide interposita debentur , vel absque interpositione fidei sint

From the in-
vention
of trusts
and the
exclusive
control
which
the
court
of equity
took of them , there naturally
grew
up that vast administrative
business
by which family
estates and
pro-
perty
are
preserved
and
managed
under
the
direction
of the
court ,
which now occupies so large
a por-
tion of its attention .
The policy of
recent legislation
is to
continually
add to this part
of the
court's
du-
ties , the exercise
of judicial discre-
tion being clearly
most beneficial
to
those persons who occupy the
posi-
tion of guardians , and those (such
as infants ) who are entitled
to the
enjoyment ,
yet
incapable
of the
management of property .

THE POWERS
OF THE COURT .
41
and
continued
to be , until the year
1852
(e) , the daily
practice
of the
court , its application
being
constantly
extended .
Equitable
jurisdiction
of
some
kind
was ,
no
doubt ,
exercised before the time of John de Waltham's
writ , but
it seems to have been the first instance of process
issued
out of the Court of Chancery without
special commission
from the king, or special authority
derived from
parlia-
ment (ƒ) , for the purpose of enforcing equitable rights by
the authority of that court alone .
Thus was established ,
in addition to his
ordinary power (potentia ordinata ), the
extraordinary
or absolute power (potentia
absoluta ) (g) of
the chancellor ,
in the
exercise of which
he disregarded
the ordinary rules of procedure in courts of law (h) , adopted
such means, by examination
on oath of the
parties
or
otherwise , as seemed
best calculated to discover the truth ,
and enforced
obedience
to his
decrees
by imprisonment .
The chancellors did not , and probably felt that they could
not , assume
all the powers which were exercised by courts
of law ; such , for instance , as summoning
a jury to deter-
mine questions of fact , and this became
one of the principal
defects of the court , which
have recently
been
rectified .
In its judgment , the Court of Chancery , whilst adhering
to those rules of law which were consonant with principles
of equity ,
boldly
overruled
those
rules
or
maxims
of
almost
absurd
and fanciful
rigour which
had
been
laid
down and pertinaciously
adhered to by judges , notwith-

Rolls ,
of a suit for specific performance
in
40 Edw. 3, where
the plaintiff pe-
titioned
the
king in parliament ,
who caused the defendant
to come
before the chancellor , the treasurer ,
the justices , and
other
sages ; and
he
states
that
the
records of the
court of chancery
contain
other in-
stances still
earlier
of the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction ,
though
none
so
early
of
compelling

execution
of
a
trust.

standing that through the accidents or necessities of social
life they in fact often worked great injustice (i).
The relief given , as compared with that now obtained ,
did not , however , for a long time extend very far ; for in
the ancient treatise entitled
Diversité
des
courtes , or Di-
versity of courts and their jurisdictions
(k) , written
by an
unknown
author in the time of King Henry the Eighth ,
we have a catalogue of the
matters of conscience then
cognisable in chancery , and these fall within a very short
range ( ) .
No regular judicial
system or rules of equity
at that time prevailed in the court . A suitor who thought
himself aggrieved
could but
obtain
a desultory
and un-
certain
remedy according to the
private
opinion
of the
chancellor (m ) , generally , and as we have already remarked
in very early times
always ,
an ecclesiastic ,
sometimes ,
though rarely , a statesman , scarcely ever a lawyer .

Equity is a roguish thing.
For law, we have
a measure,
and
know what
to trust to ; equity is
according
to the
conscience of him
that is chancellor
; and
as that is
larger
or
narrower ,
so is
equity .
'Tis all one as if they should
make
the
standard
for
the
measure

chancellor's

What an uncer-
tain measure would this be !

chancellor
has a long foot , another
a short
foot , a third
an indifferent
foot .
It is the same thing with the
chancellor's
conscience ."
(Selden's

This,
though
scarcely just at the time it
was written, might with more truth
be applied
to the
early exercise of
the court's jurisdiction .

More by Henry

no lawyer

After this time the great

committed
to the custody of lawyers , cour-
tiers (0) , and churchmen (p) , according
as the convenience
of the moment , or
the
caprice of the sovereign , might
require , until , in

Serjeant
Puckering was

time to the present the Court of

men have, as a general
rule , been

THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
judge strenuously contended against the assumption which
was made on the part of a court of equity to restrain
by
injunction
, i. e. , on pain of imprisonment
, a complainant
at law from
pursuing
his remedy at law , and reaping
the
fruits of his success .
This
contest, which
took
place when
Lord Ellesmere
was chancellor
(A.D.
1616 ) , was
so
warmly
carried
on,
that indictments
were preferred
against
the suitors , the
solicitors , the counsel , and even
a master in chancery , for
having incurred
a pramunire
by questioning in a court of
equity a judgment
in the Court of King's Bench obtained
by gross fraud and imposition (s).
This matter being brought before the king , was by him
referred to his learned counsel for their advice and opinion ,
who
reported
so
strongly
in
favour
of
the
courts
of
equity (t) ,
that
his
majesty
gave
judgment
on their
behalf ;
but ,
as might be
expected from
King James's
character , he, not content with the
irrefragable
reasons
and
precedents

relative to the commissioners
of sewers in insisting
upon
their being
subject to the control of the Court of King's
Bench were the open and
avowed
causes (2) first of his
suspension and then of his removal from office .
Lord Bacon , who
succeeded
Lord
Ellesmere , reduced
the practice of the court to a more regular
system (a) ;
but
did not sit long
enough to effect any
considerable
revolution in the science of equitable jurisprudence
itself,
and few of his
decrees that
have reached
us
are of any
great consequence
to posterity .
His
successors
, in the reign of Charles I. , did little to
improve
upon his
plan .
Lord Clarendon , when the seal
was committed to him , had withdrawn
from practice as a
lawyer nearly twenty years (b) , and the Earl of Shaftes-
bury , who received
it on Clarendon's fall , though
a lawyer
by education , had never practised at all.
But somewhat
later there
was
a change , when , in
1673 , Sir Heneage
Finch , afterwards Earl of Nottingham
, became chancellor .
He was a person of the greatest abilities and most incor-
ruptible
integrity , a thorough master and zealous defender
of the laws and constitution
of his country .
His genius
enabled him to discover the true spirit of justice , notwith-
standing
any embarrassments
raised by the narrow
and
be contrary to their oath
and
the
law .
But upon
being
brought
be-
fore the king and
council
they all
retracted and promised
obedience in
every such case for the future , except
sir
Edward
Coke , who said , " that
when the case happened
he would
do his duty ."

OF

technical
notions
prevailing
in
courts
of law, and the
imperfect
ideas of redress then
recognised
in
courts of
equity .
The
reason and necessities of mankind , arising
from the great
change in property
by the
extension
of
trade , and the abolition
of military
tenures , co -operated
in establishing
his plan , and enabled him to build up , in
the course of nine years , a system of jurisprudence
and
jurisdiction
upon
wide
and
rational
foundations .
This
has been extended and improved
by the many great men
who
have since presided in chancery , and constitutes
a
noble
monument
to
their
memory ,
monumentum
ære
perennius .
The great variety in the necessities
, the desires ,
and the habits
of society, and the craft of men follow-
ing the increase
of riches ,
rendered
the
comparatively
simple
procedure
of courts
of law inadequate
for the
complete
administration
, though
often well adapted
to
the ordinary
administration
of justice ; and this led , as
we see, to the application for an adequate
remedy to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Equity , and thereby to the
establishment of that jurisdiction
.
Now this application
was always in the form of a petition of the party aggrieved ,
stating the grievance , the defect of remedy in the courts
of common law, and mentioning
the remedy which it was
conceived ought
to be administered .
By the nature of
most of such cases , a part of this remedy consisted in the
unravelment
of a long chain of fraud , the examination
of complicated
accounts , or the administration
of large
properties ; the
mere enumeration of these seems
sug-
gestive of cumbrous machinery , and it must
be admitted
as a fact , that the procedure which
grew up in the court ,
though
powerful
to
redress
wrong ,
was
also often , and
this from an almost excess of caution , attended with such
delay and expense
as almost
to defeat its own objects.
This was a grievance
not likely to
escape
the reforming
spirit
of the present
century .
It was easily recognised
that whilst the motive vital power of the court might be
developed
and expanded , the weight
of
its
machinery ,

which bore it down and diminished
its efficacy, might be
with safety lessened .
Accordingly
, in 1824 , a royal com-
mission was appointed to consider whether any alterations
might
advantageously
be made in
the
practice
of the
court
so as to abridge
the
expense and time
attending
proceedings in the
court .
This
commission , in
1826 ,
made an elaborate report , and since that time
numerous
statutes have been passed
for the purpose of remodelling
the procedure , and correcting
errors , or
supplying
defi-
ciencies in the various offices of the court (c). By abolish-
ing many useless
forms and requisitions , due to an over
anxiety for the prevention
of injustice , by retaining
only
those rules of practice which involve the essence of the ad-
ministration
of justice , by adding
further
powers to the
court , a reform has been carried out to such an extent that
we may safely affirm , that at the present day the Court of
Chancery is nearly as free from reproach on the score of
useless
formalities , expense , and delay , which bring
disap-
pointment to the suitor , as it has ever been in regard to the
purity of the principles governing
its
decisions
.
We shall
presently recur
to
this
subject
in
the course
of
giving an
outline
of
the present
procedure by suit
.

The Master Master of the Rolls , to whom the custody of the records ,
or rolls of the court , was entrusted . It appears
, however ,
that his duties always extended beyond those merely of a
conservator to the superintendence of the issue of writs (f),
and there seems no doubt that he in very early times took
part in the judicial administration
, not only of the
com-
mon law, but also of the
equity
side of the
court (g),
though
as to the exact extent of his
authority
there has
been much controversy (h) ; but it is certain that he in later
times
acted as
a judge , subordinate
in
authority
to the
Chancellor , his decisions being
subject in some
degree
to
modification by the Chancellor .
In
order to remove the
doubt
as to his
authority
in
hearing
and
determining
causes , an act was passed
in the reign of Geo. II. (3 Geo.
2 , c. 30) , by which it was declared
that
all orders and
decrees
made by him, except such as by the course of the
court were appropriated to the great seal alone, should be
deemed
to be valid , subject nevertheless to be discharged
or altered by the Lord
Chancellor , so
as they should
not
be inrolled until signed by his lordship .
The business dis-
posed of by him continued , however , to be of limited
cha-
racter ( ) until
another
act, passed
more recently
(3 & 4

declared what judicial power

THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
The Vice-
Court
of Exchequer
was
transferred
to the
Court
of
Chancellors. Chancery ,
two
more
Vice - Chancellors
were
appoin-
ted.
At that time the Master of the Rolls had complete
authority
to
hear
and
determine
causes
at
all
their
stages , so that there were thus constituted
four
courts of
primary jurisdiction of equal authority , but the decisions
of all subject to appeal .
The business of hearing appeals
from these
courts of
primary
jurisdiction
soon
became
the principal
duty of the Lord
Chancellor , whilst sitting
in chancery, and he has for some time confined his atten-
tion almost exclusively to it.
The labour of this appellate
business is now shared by two judges , called the Lords
Justices of the Court
of Appeal
in
Chancery , who , with
the Lord
Chancellor , now form
the
Court of Appeal
in
Chancery .
This court was constituted in the year 1851
(n ) ;
it possesses
and exercises all the jurisdiction
previously
possessed
by the Lord Chancellor , and exercises
and per-
forms all powers , authorities , and duties , as well minis-
terial
as judicial , incident
to such jurisdiction
, and also
any which recent legislation
may have added
to those for-
merly
belonging
to the Lord
Chancellor
sitting in the
Court of Chancery .
The functions of the Court of Appeal
may be exercised
not only by the full court of the three judges , but by the
Lord Chancellor
alone (who , it may be observed , retained
his
former
jurisdiction
unaffected (o) ) ,
or
by the Lord
Chancellor
sitting with one Lord Justice , or by the Lords
Justices sittingtogether , apart from the Lord Chancellor (p) .
And by a still more recent act, power is given
to
each of
the Lords Justices to sit separately as a Court of Appeal ,
for the purpose
of
hearing
appeals
from
interlocutory
orders of the primary
courts (q) .

Courts of equity have by recent
acts
been

enabled (r) and required (s) to determine questions of law
in cases where it was the old practice to require
them to
be decided by a common law court ; moreover , the novel
power has been given (t) to summon juries for the deter-
mination of questions of fact
and
the assessment
of da-
mages , in certain cases , instead of granting
an injunction
against breach of contract
or continuance of a wrongful
act,
or of granting
specific performance
of
a contract .
These
enactments , by giving
the
Court of Chancery the
power of dealing with a
case in the
same manner
as a
court of law would
do , render
its
powers , in such cases ,
as complete
as those
possessed
by the
Roman Prætors .
Again , by another
act (u) ,
courts
of common law have
power given them to a limited
extent to deal with equit-
able grounds of defence
to an action , and also to grant ,
in some cases , similar relief by injunction
to that which
the Court of Chancery alone previously granted .
It must not , however , be supposed that by the changes
we have just mentioned , the Court
of Chancery has be-
come a court both of law and equity for all cases ; other-
wise, it would , of
course ,
be
the
only court
to which
suitors would ever resort in important
cases , which is not
the fact .

and unless there
is
a
proper case for such relief
,
the court will not interfere
.
A
similar remark applies
to
the common law courts
.
They
have only
a
limited
power
of
dealing with equitable doc-
trines
.
Besides
,
the practice and mode
of
procedure
,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
,
are still
entirely distinct
.
There
is
,
therefore
,
at
present
,
no
fusion of the two courts
,
and
it
remains
equally
important
,
now
as
formerly
,
to
under-
stand the
distinction
between law and
equity
,
and the
nature of the
redress
obtained in
one
court
and in the
other
.

regulate

which
are
not
recognised
by

as
legal
doctrines
,

to
show the character
of
the relief which
a
court
of
equity
gives
as
distinguished
from that which
is
obtained
in
a
court of common law
,
will be our next task
.
It
is
,
how-
ever
,
one
of
great difficulty
,
because
we are necessarily
precluded
from
giving that
complete
and
exhaustive
account
of
the doctrines
of
equitable jurisprudence
,
which
alone will completely
separate
and distinguish
those doc-
trines on the one side from the more rigid rules adopted
in
common law
,
and
on the other
from
the principles
of
natural
morality
,
which
must

CHAPTER
V.
THE
EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF
THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
IN the course of tracing
the history of the Court of
Chancery
as
a court with equitable
jurisdiction
,
it has
been inevitable
that we should
occasionally refer to some
of the
principles
of equity
which
govern its
decisions .
The
subject
is , however, worthy
of some
further
notice.
But
since equitable jurisprudence , as now established , is
of so vast and yet refined
a character that it would
be
wholly impossible , within the limits of this work , even
to
trace
to
its
source
each
leading
principle ,
much
less follow the
course
of decisions
in
all
the
various
ramifications
into which those principles
spread , we must
be content ,
abandoning
the historical
method , with an
endeavour to exhibit
a general
outline
of the
present
jurisdiction of the
court , and the nature of the
relief
granted ;
and we shall
afterwards
give
a short
account
of the mode in which , by
suit
and
other
proceeding ,
that jurisdiction is exercised

In illustration
of
this , and
as an instance of a change in rules of law , due
to the establishment of equitable doctrines , we may men-
tion what has taken place as to penal bonds .
Bonds ap-
pear to have originally been
invented to evade the absurd
law prohibiting the
taking of interest for money lent.
Equitable
If a debtor failed to repay the principal
money and inte-
rest , since judgment
could not be given for interest , the
penalty might, with some show of justice , be demanded
specifically .
And courts of law held this .
Unfortunately
,
they continued to act upon
this view after the payment of
interest became legal ; and even after the statute 37 Hen .
8, c. 9, had declared the debt to be the "just
and true
intent " of the parties
to the contract , they refused to
consider the payment of principal , interest , and
costs , as
a full
satisfaction
of the
bond .
Now, it is clear that
the object of parties in an ordinary
case of a bond is not
to provide
the penalty as a compensation for
default , but
to
secure
that default
should
not be made.

to the
case men-

note and in the
text,
we
may
add
those
ancient
and now obsolete rules referred to by
Lord Campbell , as instances of " ab-
surdities
of common
law judges ,"
viz., that no action
could
be main-
tained , or a claim
founded , upon
a
deed detained in the hands
of an-
other ; and that if a deed of grant
were lost,
the
thing
granted
was
lost with it ; that a man was liable

due by deed twice
over, if on payment
he omitted

performance of the duty
contracted for, and in respect of which
the
penalty
is
imposed , the defaulter
can substantially
place the other
party in as good a position
as if no default had occurred ,
which may often happen , it is unfair and harsh to enforce
the penalty .
Accordingly
, equity interfered in aid of the
obligor (d).
Similar remarks
apply to the forfeiture
of
mortgaged
lands , because
the only object of a mortgage
is
a
security
for the
repayment
of money with
inte-
rest, and therefore
a forfeiture
of the lands
ought
not
actually to take place until it is proved , in the most defi-
nite manner , that the money
cannot
be repaid .
These
equitable
principles , after long
being
acted
upon in the
Court of Chancery , were, like several others (e) ,
at last
forced upon courts of law by the legislature ().

that lands

to the simple

they were the law of the land , and, as such, observed
as
well by courts of equity as other courts , " hoc quidem per
quam durum est, sed ita lex scripta est ” (g).
The law of primogeniture , as it obtains in this country ,
is not looked upon with favour in other countries , and in
the opinion of many is not well founded in justice , yet no
one would think for a moment of urging
any argument as
to its injustice in a court of equity .
In such cases equity
not only does not pretend

,
if

it
has shot not much

.
The
most
remarkable
of these
is
the manner
in
which courts
of
equity have dealt with the
Statute

.
This was an enactment
of

it

wide door open
to
the very
vice of fraud which
it
was intended
to

an instance
of
the extreme
difficulty
attending
all human

This door equity has boldly shut by disregarding
the statute
.
The
statute says that no action

lands by a simple
deposit of deeds
relating
to them , is as
near to a repeal of the statute as can well be imagined (¿).
Another instance where equity has made some not incon-
siderable
inroad
upon
a rule of positive law occurs in
reference to the
Registration
Acts
(k ) .
These
statutes Registration
require
that all incumbrances
upon lands in the
counties
to which
they
relate
shall , in order to be supported
as
against
subsequent dealings , be registered .
Equity has,
however , modified this rule , to the extent of determining
that where the person dealing
subsequently has notice of
the prior incumbrance , he
shall give effect to it , whether
registered or not ( 1) .
It is certainly
a most righteous
principle
(m) , that
a
person who has notice of the just claim of another
shall
not avail himself of any formal defect in the title of that
other so as to oust his rights , yet , in the cases

he then brings an action for mesne profits , here common
law could
not allow a set-off in the action of the money
expended, yet the action
would

such
allowance ; a court of equity would , in such a case , inter-
fere (n).
In the
case of accounts between partners ,
a court of

of a court of

actions

inconvenient

the

a court
of
equity
is not
the proper tribunal
for
a mere money demand , yet , from
its power to investigate
intricate
facts , it has long
exer-
cised jurisdiction in
cases
of complicated
accounts (o) ;
and where there
is any
relation
of confidence
existing
between the parties , such , for instance , as that of principal
and agent , the case seems still more naturally
to fall within
the jurisdiction ; but unless the accounts are mutual , and
not consisting of payments and receipts on one side only ,
or at least very complicated , or the confidential relation is
clear , the court will refuse to entertain the case (p).

the spirit .
rules of interpretation
of laws or instruments
adopted by cording to
it, is that it determines according to the spirit of the rule ,
and not the strictness of the letter (q) ; and no doubt this
is a favourite
maxim of the court , but it by no means is
a
canon of interpretation
belonging
peculiarly
to this
court .
There is not
a single
rule
of interpreting
laws
which
is not equally used by all judges , as well those of
courts of law
as of courts of equity .
The law on this
subject was laid
down , long
ago , as follows (r) :-" From
which
cases it appears that the
sages of the law hereto-
fore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in
some
appearance
, and
those
statutes which
comprehend
all things in the letter they have expounded to extend but
to somethings, and those which generally prohibit all people
from
doing
such an act they have interpreted
to permit
some
people to do it , and those which
comprehend every
person in the letter they have adjudged to reach to some
persons
only , which expositions have always been founded
upon the intent of the legislature , which
they have col-
lected sometimes by considering the cause
and necessity
of making
the aet, sometimes by comparing one part of
the act with
another , and sometimes by foreign
circum-
stances, so that they have ever been guided by the intent
of the legislature , which they have always taken according
to the necessity of the matter , and according to that which
is consonant to reason and good discretion ."
The construction of an act of parliament , therefore , is
the same in all courts ; or if they differ , it is only as
one
judge
may differ from
another judge
in the
same
court ,
a difference which , from
the
difficulty
which exists in
framing statutes , so
as to be free from
ambiguity , un-
happily not unfrequently
occurs.
It comes
oftener within
the province of a court of equity , acting
as it does in the
administration
of property , to give constructions to execu-
tory instruments , such as wills , agreements for settlement ,

and the like ; and in doing this , judicial liberality in the
interpretation
of language is often very largely called into
play , but no rule of interpretation
peculiar to the court is
ever contended for ( s) .
For instance , suppose
a deed of
settlement purporting
to be made in pursuance of articles
does
not carry into
effect what
a court of equity would
construe
as the intention
of the articles , a court of law
adheres
to the
construction
of the
deed , and disregards
the articles (t) ; and
so also would
a court of equity , so
long
as no proceedings
have been taken to reform the
settlement (u) , even though the case was such that a court
of equity
would , probably , in a suit
instituted
for the
purpose , reform the settlement (x).

a

of
the

execution of
refused to produce it, and consequently it was necessary
to resort to equity to obtain
a relaxation
of such rules .
But since courts of law have
so far modified their
rules
as to make due provision for these difficulties , it has resulted
that accident rarely now forms
a satisfactory
reason for
equitable interference : and in most cases , where the juris-
diction
is allowed
to
exist
at all , it is merely
because ,
having
been once
acquired , it cannot
be afterwards
lost
or abandoned .
Of those few cases
which , resting
upon
the
ground
of
accident ,
are
such
that
relief
can
still
only be obtained in a court of equity , we may mention , as
an example , that of a defective execution of a power. If Defective
a man , having a power to appoint
a fund , and intending
apower.
to execute it , does
so by will, when , perhaps , the power
requires a deed , or where some other formalities in execut-
ing the power , not of the
essence of the
act, have not
been observed
, these
are
accidental
circumstances
which
render the execution of the power bad at law ; yet equity
has always , if there was some good moral reason for sup-
porting the execution of the power , such as to provide for
payment of debts ,
or the
support
of wife
or children ,
been ready to interfere and establish the execution of the
power ( ).
It may here be noticed that equity has never
ventured
to correct
a defective execution of a will , the
mode of executing
that particular
instrument
being
one
to which the legislature
has paid especial attention
; and
though , through the accidental ignorance of an intending
testator , he may fail to carry out his intention , this is an
irremediable
accident , and rightly
so , for
reasons
suffi-
ciently obvious .
As to trusts , the relation
of trustee
and beneficiary , Trusts.
or cestui
que
trust , is, when a trust
technically
so called
exists , no doubt
peculiarly
within the jurisdiction of a
court
of equity , but there
are many
cases
substantially
of trust which
are
cognizable
in courts of law ; for in-

stance , deposits and all manner of bailments , and espe-
cially that implied
contract , so highly beneficial and use-
ful , of having
undertaken
to account for money received
to another's use, which
is the ground of an action on the
case almost
as universally
remedial
as
a bill
in
equity .
And there are
cases where courts of law take notice even
of trusts , commonly
so
called ; for instance ,
a court of
law allows
an executor or administrator
to retain
for
a
debt owing to a trustee under a trust of which the execu-
tor or administrator
is the cestui que trust (a) .
All these descriptions of equity , then , as distinguished
definitions
from law, in our system of administration
of justice , are ,
as we
see , inaccurate and incomplete ; and yet , to no in-
considerable extent , they assist the mind in comprehend-
ing what
portion
of the whole
area of justice
is
taken
possession of by the Court of Chancery .
For equity does ,
in each
department of natural justice
indicated by these
descriptions , go farther , and take a wider and less restricted
view than
courts of law do , and so it is able to approach
somewhat
nearer to that complete and perfect result , the
attainment of which
is scarcely to be hoped by the most
sanguine .
Fraud in

There have been

scrupulous
adherence to
conscientious
dealing , and the
rules of the court have consequently been relaxed in this
respect (b).

tient (h) : it may be added , that if the benefit be conferred
upon third parties who have taken
no part in the trans-
action , and are therefore innocent of all fraud , still they
will not
be allowed
to retain
that which
comes
through
a polluted channel ( ).
Notwithstanding
the willingness of the court to exercise
this control over the consciences
of men , great caution is
observed not to encroach
upon
the
functions
properly
exerciseable by other courts ; and a remarkable
case of the
refusal of the Court
of Chancery
to
interfere
is that of
Allen v. M'Pherson (k) , where the House of Lords , sitting
as a court of appeal from the
Court
of Chancery , held
that the court would
not after probate
set aside
a will
obtained fraudulently
and by undue influence .
From what
we have shown , it will
be
observed that
equity does in no inconsiderable
measure fulfil the popular
notion entertained of it , that it aims at complete justice
irrespective
of any legal
quibble
or technical
difficulty .
Still , it must carefully be borne in mind , that the court is
slow at the present
day to convert
any moral
doctrine.
which
has
not already been
made
a ground
of equitable
jurisdiction , into a principle
of equity .
We pass on now
to another
and wholly distinct
ground
which
has been
occupied by the court , and where it has brought within
the range of its influence
a large field ofjurisdiction.
The court from
the earliest
times has adopted a mode

EQUITABLE RELIEF .

lief which

usually given by courts of law , and this has drawn within
its cognisance
a vast
series of cases
where
the
suitors
think that
the relief in a court of law is inadequate
to
their wants .
The
relief given
by the
Court
of Equity Positive
re-
may be described
as
of
a
positive
character
,
giving the the court
specific thing which
the
parties
are entitled
to
,
whilst
actions
at
law
,
with
a
few exceptions
(1),
give only the
negative remedy
of
compensation by damages for
a
depri-
vation
or
violation of the true right
.
Wherever
possible
,
equity takes care that
a
right shall
be actually
enjoyed
,
and with this
view will interfere
to
prevent
a
violation
of
that right
(

).
A
court
of
law will
not
interfere till
the violation
be
effected
.
It
,
for in-
stance
,
will
,
when
a
breach of covenant
in
a
lease
or
in
a
contract
between landowners
has been
committed
,
give damages for the breach
,
but
a
court
of
equity will
do
more
,
it
will
anticipate
the event
,
and restrain
a
person
who merely shows
an
intention
to
break his covenants
(n).
Or
,
to
take
another
example
illustrating the
beneficial
result
obtained
by such ready interference
,
damages
will
be
given
in
the one court
if
a
man has been carrying
on
a
trade
in
some particular
locality
in
violation
of
his con-
tract with another man not

which will
be only given for past acts of trading , are , it
may be, of small
value
as
a remedy compared with
the
effectual relief which the other court gives by prohibiting
the trade
on pain
of imprisonment
.
This positive kind
of relief is
clearly of great value in these
cases ; it will
even be granted
although
the parties
by their contract
have fixed
the
amount
of damages
in
respect of the
breach (0).
The two kinds
of justice
which may be obtained , the
one strictly remedial , the other preventive
in respect of
the violation of continuing
rights , are clearly different in
kind ;-one is legal , the other equitable
;-and neither of
the two courts will usurp the
functions of the other. If
the injury complained of be completed , so that compen-
sation
alone
can
be
awarded ,
the court of equity
has
nothing
to do
with the
case (p),
although
the
court
now (1) can in many such
cases award damages in addi-
tion to or even , according to its discretion , in substitution.
for the injunction
; yet it will refuse to interfere altogether
if a court of law could have given every remedy which the
case
admits of (r).

that the fact of a penalty , or even

the parties , is not

court , if the real intention

If,
however , it
appears
that the
observance of the agreement and the
payment for the breach were equally
within the intention , then the court
will not interfere .

EQUITABLE
RELIEF .
67
though able now under
certain
circumstances
to
issue a
writ of injunction
, will not entertain any application when
no breach has been committed .
Another branch
of the same kind of positive relief is
the power which
the
court exercises of compelling
the
specific
performance
of agreements .
A
man
may be
indirectly
compelled
to
carry
out
his
contract
by the
fear of being mulcted
in damages by a court of law , in
the event of his failing to do so ; but another , and often
a desirable
mode, is to insist
upon
his
performing
the
duty which he owes under the contract by putting
him in
prison till he does
so ; or, as may happen in some
cases ,
to do it for him, of course at his cost.
The latter
are the
courses
which
the Court of Chancery
adopts .
If a man
agrees
to sell land , he will be at the
proper
stage
of
a suit in equity , instituted
for the purpose ,
ordered to
execute a conveyance, and if he disobeys he will be im-
prisoned for contempt : or the court will make an order
vesting
the land
having
the
same effect as if he had
executed it (s ) .
By virtue
then of the
peculiar
reliefs
which this court is able to give , and which
other courts
cannot give , the specific performance of contracts forms
an important
branch of equitable jurisdiction.
But it is
not
every
contract
that
will
draw with it an
equity
to compel its fulfilment.
Some contracts are obviously
entered into solely for the purpose of making
a profit ; of
this kind
are the ordinary
commercial
contracts for the
purchase
or sale of goods such as are
constantly in the
market
in the case of these contracts , if they be broken ,
damages are all that
are or can be required ; with these ,
therefore , equity has nothing
to do .
Other contracts
are
of a peculiar nature , involving
personal
conduct or some
similar ingredient , such as to sing at a theatre (t) , or write

a book (u) , or keep an inn (x) , or even build a house (y) .
It is considered to be beyond the power of any court to
secure
the due performance of such acts by any amount of
compulsion (~) , and
so
equity will
not
decree
their
per-
formance ;
nevertheless , in
many of
even
these
cases ,
equity will , indirectly , do much towards securing the due
completion of the agreement ; for if the
contract
contain
a negative clause correlative
to the positive
agreement ,
such as not to sing at any other theatre , or not to write
plays
for
any
other
theatre ,
equity
will
interfere
by
restraining
a violation
of the
negative
clause (a).
This
interference will
be granted , however , only
on
condition
that the plaintiff who seeks
the aid of the
court
is not
himself under any obligation
to do any acts of that nature
which the
court
cannot specifically
enforce .
This
is an
obviously reasonable condition , for it would be contrary to
all the practice of the court to give equitable relief to one
over whom the court has not complete control in respect
of his correlative duties (b).

tracts

we have mentioned for the sale or purchase of an interest
in land , and also of many kinds of personal property , such
as shares in a company (d) , are instances which
are daily
before the court .
We will only add that where the main
provisions of the contract have been of a description such
as the court commonly deals with, but some minor acces-
sory term is of a personal nature , the court has in a few
instances
ordered specific performance of that which can
be so decreed , and directed a covenant to be entered
into
for the rest (e).
There are many other instances of this kind of relief
by which
the
court
substantially
enforces the
due
ob-
servance
of rights , by restraining
the commission of acts
in violation
of them , besides
cases of contract .
Thus ,
the court will
restrain

of a trade mark (g) , and

EQUITABLE
JURISDICTION
OF THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
Restraint of
action at
law on
equitable
grounds.
We have already adverted to the power which the court
has
assumed of preventing
persons from
proceeding
at
law contrary to equity and good conscience : this is done
by injunction .
The court has always declined laying down
precise rules as to the limits within which it will keep
in
exercising the power of granting injunctions , but
such
limits
may now usually
be
determined
with
sufficient
accuracy by reference to precedents , a very vast number
of which are contained in the reports (?).
Another species of suit , the reason for which very much.
arises from the power of giving peculiar
relief possessed
by the court
is , where the court , at the
instance
of the
plaintiff, sets aside a completed transaction . If there
be
good grounds
for treating
a conveyance of property
or
other deed
or instrument
as an improper
transaction , and
for setting it aside, a court of equity alone has the power
to accomplish that result in a direct manner .
A court of
law is either
powerless to deal with the case at all , or at
the most possesses
inadequate
powers .
The grounds for
setting
aside a completed
transaction , which
usually are
some species of fraud , may be pleaded in a court of law ;
but a plea can only arise as a defence
to an action of some
kind , and no procedure at law is applicable for commencing
proceedings to avoid the effect of a deed upon the ground
of fraud .
But
a bill may be filed praying
that a deed of
conveyance or other instrument
obtained in some improper
manner may be set aside, and the rights of parties restored
to the state in which they would have been had such deed
or other instrument
never been executed (k).

Until
recently ,
there was a numerous
class
of suits Inter-
called
interpleader

claims .
Where a man in the possession of certain goods

to the adverse
claims of several persons, it often happens that he cannot
safely take
a discharge
from
any of them ,
since it is
doubtful which of them is properly entitled to claim .

such cases the court gives relief by requiring
the several
claimants , when brought
before it in a suit instituted
for
the purpose , to interplead , that is , bring their claims to an
issue , so as to be decided upon .
Formerly, this remedy
in equity was alone available
for the purpose , but
since
similar
remedies have been given to courts of law ( ),
interpleader
suits are less common , being usually confined
to cases where the claims are of an equitable nature .
We have seen (m ) that the Court of Chancery had , as Partition .
part of its common law jurisdiction , cognisance of a writ
of partition
in certain cases ; and in other cases the old
writ of partition
issued out of chancery , but was return-
able at common law ; this writ was originally
only
ap-
plicable
to the case of coparceners ; it was , in the reign.
of Hen. VIII . , extended to all cases of joint tenancy and
tenancy in common , and continued to be occasionally used
until abolished by the statute 3 & 4 Will . 4 ,
c. 27 , s . 36 ;
but there were many inconveniences attending it , from the
inability of
courts of law to compel
discovery ,
and to
make compensation for inequality in the division of pro-
perty , which
obviously would
often be necessary.
These
reasons
led to the adoption of a concurrent jurisdiction
by
courts of equity , the practical
convenience of which led
to the disuse and abolition of the writ .

EQUITABLE
JURISDICTION
OF THE
COURT
OF CHANCERY
.
Bills of
peace.
The
method
of
procedure
adopted by the
Court
of
Chancery is by issue of a commission to make the parti-
tion
and adjust the rights of the parties by giving com-
pensation ,
or owelty ,
as it is called , where
the
divided.
portions
of the land cannot be accurately made propor-
tionate
to the
shares
of the
several owners ; liberty
is ,
however , usually given to the parties themselves to make
proposals for the partition , and the court gives its consi-
deration to these .
Recently , the benefit of this action on
the part of the
court has
been
extended by giving the
court power to direct
a sale of the property in certain
cases instead of a partition , which
obviously
would often
be very advantageous , but previously
could
not
be done
without the consent of all concerned , a thing often , through
infancy or other disabilities , not to be obtained (n).
In some cases , in which a perfect and appropriate remedy
exists
at law, but the
circumstances
are such as to give
rise to innumerable
actions at law, founded upon the same
general private right , each of which actions must be sepa-
rately tried and disposed
of, whether such right is a right
claimed in favour or against a number
of persons
, equity
will interfere , in order to avoid multiplicity of suits , or to
prevent oppressive litigation
.
Thus , where the amount of
a general
fine, payable by all the copyhold
tenants of a
manor , is in dispute (o) , or where the rights
of common
to which the tenants are
entitled are not ascertained (p),
equity will
entertain
a suit
on behalf of all the copyhold
tenants .
Another
instance of such interference
is where
the court will restrain a man from continuing
to invade a
legal right by a
series
of separate acts ,
each
of which
gives rise to an action , but the damages in each
case are
trivial ; thus
equity will
restrain
the infringement
of an
ancient
ferry (9 ) .

, we may mention
a recent case where the reservoir of a waterworks company
burst , thereby causing
damage to a very large number of
people ; a large
number
of claims
was made against the
company , all founded upon similar grounds . The company
instituted
a suit against some of them , for the purpose of
determining ,
once
for all ,
a question
which
had
arisen ,
upon which turned the validity
of the claims .
The court
entertained
the bill as of the nature of a bill of peace ,

so , since the claims were not
absolutely identical (r).

mention , is the
perpetuation
of
testimony .
Courts of
common
law only permit
the
examination
of witnesses
when an action is at issue, and the evidence must be con-
fined to the issue in such action .
It sometimes happens
that
there is
a reasonable
certainty
of litigation
at a
future
time , yet , from the
circumstances
of the
case ,
the right to be claimed
or defended in
such
litigation
cannot , or does not , form the subject of present proceed-
ings .
To
take
a single
instance ,
a person
may be in
possession of an estate under
a title depending
upon a
marriage , the validity of which he may have reasonable
cause
to fear will be disputed , and to support which , if
litigation should ensue, the evidence of certain witnesses
would be necessary.
Now, clearly he, being in possession ,
can take no proceedings
against
a possible
claimant who
does not come forward
; if, therefore , he had no means of
preserving
the evidence in question , there might result
a
failure
of justice ,
because
the
other
might
await
the
deaths of the witnesses , and then
press his claim .
It is
easy to suggest numerous similar instances .
For all these
the Court of Chancery has provided a remedy by allowing
a bill to be filed to perpetuate the testimony (s).

theless , it takes every care
that
this right shall
not be
abused,
as
it is obviously
not unattended
with
danger ,
because
witnesses , whose evidence is not to be published
until a period which may be subsequent to their decease (t) ,
are , under
some temptation , to give interested
evidence.
If, therefore , by any means the issue can be tried at once ,
such
a suit will not be allowed (u) .
When the evidence
has been taken , it is sealed
up until the time comes to use
it, and the suit is at an end, for , of course , it never comes
to a hearing , and the plaintiff pays the costs.
A modern act (v) has extended the benefit of this pro-
ceeding to a case
not previously
admitted by the court ,
viz. , where a person would , under the circumstances which
he alleges to exist , become entitled , upon the happening of
some future event, to any honour , title, dignity, or office ,
or any estate or interest in any property , the title to which
cannot be brought
to trial before the happening
of the
event in question . It enables
him to file a bill in chancery
to perpetuate any
testimony
which
may be material
to
support
his
claim .
In any such
suit , if the
crown
is
interested , the attorney -general is to be made a party in
respect of such interest , and in any proceedings in which
the evidence taken in the suit is
used , no objection
shall
be taken that the crown was not a party to the suit .
We have hitherto

diction
of the
court
which , having
for
its
origin the
ancient
assumptions of power
on the
part of the early
chancellors , although modified

legislation , may be described
as
its

the dissolution

lection
and distribution
of the
assets
are made under the
direction
of the
court (y).
Other

with the affairs of companies , not being

up , are
also cast upon the court.
By the same act, the court has
power to rectify the register of members , if the name of
any person is without sufficient cause entered in or omitted
from the register (z) .
Also under the later act of 1867
(30 & 31 Vict . c . 131 ) , the court has other duties
to per-
form
relative
to
schemes
for
reducing
the
capital
of
companies .
To these we need not refer in detail .
Somewhat analogous to the duties of the court relative
to companies generally , are
some
special provisions
made
by the legislature
for railway companies .
Under certain
circumstances , schemes
for the arrangement of the affairs.
of these companies , when they are in financial
difficulties ,
may be proposed to the court (a).
Another most important
power
conferred by the legis-
lature upon the court , is that which it exercises in favour
of creditors , for the purpose of enabling
them to obtain
satisfaction
of their
debts by sale of the
lands of their
debtor .

This , in the case of a deceased
debtor , was given by the
act 3 & 4 Will . 4, c. 104.
In the case of a living debtor ,
there were no means of applying
the lands themselves to
the purpose of paying
debts by a sale of them until the
year 1838 , when the act
1 & 2 Vict . c. 110 , was
passed ,
and then , and for
a long period afterwards , the process
remained tedious and costly ; but now a creditor who has
obtained
judgment ,
and
taken
the
lands
in
execution
under a writ of elegit , may obtain an order for
their
sale
in a simple and speedy manner by petition to the court (b) .
Upon hearing the petition , the court directs
inquiries
to
be made as to the debtor's
interest in the land
and his
title thereto , and
as far as possible
conducts the sale in
the same way as in the other
case , where the lands of a
deceased
person are sold for the payment of his debts (c).

as cases of trust and those relating

Trusts and

naturally
the
subjects of the
care
of the
Court
of
Chancery , any improvements
of the law, or facilities
for
the satisfaction
of the wants of society which the legis-
lature might devise, would
of course take effect by the
agency of the Court of Chancery ;
accordingly
we find
that several acts have been passed for the purpose of meet-
ing the specific wants of trustees and
infants .
By the
Trustee Relief Act (12 & 13 Vict. c. 74) , trustees may in
suitable cases discharge themselves from all responsibility
by paying the trust
moneys into the Court of Chancery ,
after which , the court takes upon itself the custody and
distribution
of the funds
exactly
as if a suit
had
been
regularly
commenced for the
purpose (d).
It
may be
noticed that this act does
not , perhaps , extend the juris-

of the court , so much
as
provide

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
Trustee Act , 1850
(13 & 14 Vict . c. 60) , provides
for the
appointment of new trustees of a settlement or will , in a
summary and expeditious
way, without instituting a suit
for the general
administration
of the trust
and
a later
act (22 & 23 Vict . c. 35, s . 30) allows
trustees to ask for
and obtain the advice of the court upon matters relating
to their trust, without the formalities
of a suit.
But the legislature
has
done more than provide short
and inexpensive
modes of obtaining
the benefits of the
court's guidance in those matters
relating to administra-
tion of property , for it has
in
several
instances
given
power to the court to do more than it formerly could ; it
can now actually change the legal right to land or estate ,
if a trustee refuse to act, or be unknown , or not to be
found (e).
Closely connected with these statutory provisions facili-
tating the discharge of their duties
by trustees , are those
which
relate to the custody and management
of infants
and their
property .
Infants
are ,
as
we
have
before
shown (f) , peculiarly
the care of the court of chancery,
representing
the
sovereign in his
character
of parens
patria.
The benefit derived from this care has not been
without its share of legislative
attention , and accordingly
special and enlarged powers have been given to the court .
By the
Custody of Infants' Act
(2 & 3 Vict . c. 54) , a
mother of an infant who is in the
sole custody or control
of the father
or his
agent , or of any guardian
after the
father's death , may obtain an order from the court allow-
ing her access to the infant at reasonable times ; or , if the
infant be within the age of
seven
years , the court may
order
the delivery
of the infant into
her
custody until
attaining
that age.
Again , under an act passed in the year 1855
(18 & 19
Vict. c. 43 , commonly called the Infants' Settlement Act) ,
the court
may give
its sanction
to a settlement
by an

in contemplation
of mar-
riage ; and it provides that a settlement
made with this
sanction , shall
be
as valid
and effectual as if the person
executing the settlement were of the full age of twenty-
one years.
The act is limited , however , in its application
to infants who , if males , are of the age of twenty years ,
and if females , of the age of seventeen
years or upwards (g).
In the following
year , 1856 , another act was passed ( 19)
& 20 Vict . c. 120 ), which
enables the court to authorise
leases
or sales of any settled
estates
(h) , which the court
may in its discretion
deem proper to be carried out .
This
act extended the
powers which had
been
conferred by
the legislature
upon the court , about twenty -six years
previously
(by
1 Will .
4 ,
c .
65 ) ,
enabling
the
court
to authorise
leases
to
be granted of lands of which
an
infant might be seised
in fee or in tail ( ) .
The object of these
acts was to allow advantage to be
taken of the discovery of mineral wealth , the improvement
of the value of property by the
extension of towns
and
other causes , to obtain which advantage it had previously
been common , in the case of large
estates , to apply to
parliament
for private
acts , a proceeding through its cost-
liness inapplicable
to small holdings .
By another
act
(25 & 26 Vict . c. 108 ) trustees having
by the terms of their
trust
powers
to dispose of land by
sale, exchange , partition , or enfranchisement , may , with
the sanction of the Court of Chancery , deal specially with
the minerals ( ).

(h) The settlement
is , by section
1, confined to cases where lands are

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF
THE
COURT
OF CHANCERY .
The legislature
has ever been anxious to promote the
improvement
of property , and
has passed several
acts
with that object ; to these we only refer here in order to
remark , that whenever the consent or act of an owner of
land , or of some
interest in land , is necessary
, and could
not by reason of his infancy
or
incapacity
be otherwise
obtained , the court of chancery is empowered , in a proper
case , to authorise the act , or give the consent on behalf of
such infant or incapacitated person .
The authority or con-
sent is obtained upon a simple application
by petition
(1) .
So where land in settlement , or belonging
to persons
under some incapacity to deal with their interest , is com-
pulsorily taken
for , or injuriously
affected
by , some work
of public
importance , such
as
a railway , canal , or public
building (m), the special authority
to take or injure which
is , of course , derived from the legislature
, it is always en-
trusted
to the court of chancery to see that the
money

as
purchase -money or by way of compensation , is
applied in accordance with the rights

the attorney -general , as repre-

at the relation
or instigation
of some
private
individual
interested in the welfare
of the

But besides
the jurisdiction of the court to investigate and
control
the affairs of a charity upon the institution of a
suit , the legislature
has provided
more
speedy
and in-
expensive modes of correcting
abuses .
By the act, usually
called sir Samuel
Romilly's Act (52 Geo . 3 , c . 101 ) , an
application
may be made, by the attorney -general
acting
ex officio , or by any two or more persons interested in the
charity , with the consent of the attorney -general , to the
court , praying
for such relief as the nature of the
case
may require (o).
This summary jurisdiction of the court
over charities
has been
much
enlarged by the Charitable
Trust Acts ,
1853 , 1855 , and
1860 (p ) , which have made provision for
most cases which
experience has pointed
out to require
some more effectual or less costly remedy than previously
existed .
The details of these enactments would be out of

The last of the special
powers which

control which , by the Attor-

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF THE

Solicitors
have always been , and are , considered
as officers
of the court , and therefore have always been subject to its
authority in matters
relating
to their professional
duty ;
but by the
act just mentioned , peculiar
facilities
are
given both to the client , for the purpose of ascertaining
that he has been fairly dealt with by his professional adviser ,
and to the solicitor
for obtaining
payment of his costs .
We have thus
illustrated , so far
as our limits
would
allow , the subject of this chapter ; but there remains
one
subject
which ,
though
not
strictly
a part of equitable
jurisdiction ,
is
so closely allied
to it, that it may , with
advantage, find
its place at the
close
of a description of
the power of the court .
In the same category , of those who , like infants , require
a quasi parental care , are persons who , being either idiots (q)
jurisdiction
or of unsound mind , are unable to take care of themselves
of chancery. or their
property .
We have already remarked
that the
of the court
sovereign , to whose care these fall , entrusts
the charge to
the chancellor .
But the care
of idiots and lunatics
does
not form part of the general jurisdiction of the court of
chancery .
The
master of the rolls
and the vice-chan-
cellors have no jurisdiction whatever to interfere with the
affairs of a lunatic , which would
not be the case if such
interference
were considered to be part of the
inherent
jurisdiction of the court , because
in that case all applica-
tions would be heard in the first instance by one of them .
It is convenient , however , in this
place, to mention
the

to

person
who
appeared
to
be
incapable
of
taking

,
directed that the
income should
be applied for his maintenance
(t).
The custody
of
an idiot and
of
his lands was formerly
vested
in
the lord
of

by
special custom

but
,
by
reason
of
the manifold
abuses
of
this power by subjects
,
it
was
at
last provided by common consent
,
that
it
should
be given
to
the king
,
as
the general
conservator
of
his
people
;
in
order
to
prevent
the idiot
from wasting
his
estate
;
and reducing himself and his heirs
to
poverty and
distress
(y
).
This fiscal prerogative
of
the king
is
declared
in
parliament
by statute
17 Edw
.
2,
c.
9,
which
directs
(
in
affirmance
of
the common law
(2)
)
that the king shall
have ward
of
the lands
of
natural fools
,
taking the profits
without
waste
or
destruction
,
and shall find them
neces-
saries
;
and after the death of such idiots he shall
render
the
estate
to
the heirs
:
in
order
to
prevent
such idiots
from
aliening
their
lands
,
and
their
heirs
from
being
disinherited
.
By the old common law there was
a
writ
de
idiota in-
quirendo
,
to
inquire whether
a
man be an idiot
or
not
(a):
which must
be
tried by
a
jury
of
twelve men
:
and
,
if
they
find him purus idiota
,
the
profits
of
his lands
and the
custody of his person may be granted by the king
to
some
subject
,
who has interest
enough
to
obtain
them
.
This
appropriation
of property
to
the use
of
the
crown
was
long ago considered
as
a
hardship
upon private
families

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
and as early as in the 8 Jac.
1 , it was under the conside-
ration of parliament , to vest this custody in the relations
of the party , and to settle an
equivalent on the crown in
lieu of it ; it being then proposed that this and the slavery
of the feudal
tenures , which
has since been
abolished ,
should share the same fate (b) .
Yet few instances can be
given of the oppressive exertion of it , since
it seldom hap-
pened that
a jury found
a man an idiot
a nativitate but
only non compos
mentis from some particular
time ; which
formerly
had an operation very different in point of law .
A man is not an idiot
(c) , if he has any glimmering
of reason , so that
he can tell his parents , his age , or the
like
common
matters .
But
a man
who
is born
deaf,
dumb , and blind , is looked
upon by the law in the
same
state with an idiot (d) ; he being
supposed incapable
of
any understanding , as wanting
all
those
senses
which
furnish the human mind with
ideas (e).
A lunatic , or non
compos
mentis , is one who has had
understanding , but by disease, grief,
or other
accident ,
has lost the use of his reason (f).
A lunatic
is indeed
properly
one
that
has
had lucid
intervals :
sometimes
enjoying
his
senses , and sometimes
not , and that
fre-
quently depending
upon the changes of the moon .
But
under
the general
name of non
compos
mentis
(which
sir
Edward Coke
says
is the most
legal
name)
are
com-
prised
not only
lunatics , but persons under frenzies ,
or
who lose their intellects by disease
; those that grow deaf ,
dumb , and blind , not being born so ;
or such , in short , as

it was held
that
one who

was to be deemed non

tis .
The presumption
that a per-
son deaf, dumb , and blind
from his
nativity is an idiot, is
only a legal
presumption , and is therefore
open
to be rebutted
by evidence
of ca-
pacity .

are proved to be incapable of conducting
their own affairs .
To these also , as well as idiots , the king has always been
guardian , but to a very different
purpose .
For the law
always imagined that these accidental
misfortunes
might
be removed ; and therefore only constituted
the crown a
trustee for the unfortunate
persons , to protect their pro-
perty , and to account to them for all profits received , if
they recover , or after their decease to their representatives .
And therefore it was declared by the statute
17 Edw . 2 , c.
10, that the king should provide for the custody and sus-
tentation
of lunatics ,
and
preserve their
lands
and the
profits of them for their
use , when
they
came to their
right mind ; and the king should take nothing
to his own
use ; and if the parties
died in
such
estate , the residue
should
be distributed
for their souls by the advice of the
ordinary
of course now (by the subsequent amendments
of the law of administration
) the
residue
goes
to their
executors or administrators
.
:
Formerly, also , there was a writ de lunatico inquirendo ,
upon which persons were ascertained to be lunatics , which
was tried much like the writ de idiota
inquirendo .
These
writs
are now
superseded
by the modern methods which
have
been
introduced
and
improved
as
experience
has
pointed out the most
convenient
and beneficial
measures
to be adopted .
At the present
time the whole
care
of
lunatics
is regulated by acts of parliament (g) , both
as to
those who are so found , after solemn inquiry or inquisition
,
and those who , though of unsound mind , have
not
been
so found by inquisition
, either by reason of the expecta-
tion of their recovery entertained by their friends , or from
their not being possessed
of any property .
Both private
madhouses
and
public
asylums

for the various.

When it is necessary to prove a person a lunatic , so
that a proper legal control may be exercised over both his
person and property , application is made to the lord chan-
cellor , and if allowed by him (or the lords justices of the
court of appeal) , the inquiry is conducted by certain officers
called the masters in lunacy , either with or without the
assistance of a jury , according
as the lord chancellor may

CHAPTER
VI.
A SUIT
IN CHANCERY .
WE will endeavour , in this chapter , to exhibit
to the
reader a general
view of the proceedings in
a chancery
suit , so as to enable one who is not familiar with the course
of the court to understand the principal
events which take
place , their
effects , and relative
importance ; but it will
not
be possible , within the limits to which
we are con-
fined , to give much account of the numerous rules which
require to be observed in conducting
the proceedings .
orders of
In the course of years, innumerable
disputes
have, as General
may be easily supposed , arisen
as to procedure , and in the court.
order to prevent their recurrence in similar
cases , and also
to provide for the due management of business , rules have
been from time to time laid down .
Some of these , called
the general
orders of the court , have been
promulgated
by the chancellor , or more recently by the chancellor and
other judges ,
acting
for that
purpose
under
legislative
authority (a) .
These, not having
been made merely
for
the purpose of deciding
any particular
case , are
binding
upon all the judges .
Other rules have become
established
as rules
of practice by being laid down in the course
of
deciding
particular
cases , and
adopted
subsequently by
other judges
as binding precedents .
In the year
1852 ,
The
Improvement
of Jurisdiction
of Equity Act (b) was
passed , and in the year 1860 , all the then existing general
orders were abrogated , and a new series was issued , which

A SUIT IN
CHANCERY .
The bill .
consolidated and amended
the former orders.
These enact-
ments and
orders , with
a
few
subsequent
acts (c )
and
general
orders and regulations , together with a vast col-
lection of reported cases
decided upon points of practice ,
now constitute the law of the court .
It would
be tedious , and it is unnecessary for our pur-
pose , to give any historical
account of the various pro-
ceedings , when and how they
originated , and how they
gradually
assumed their present form.
We shall, there-
fore , confine our description
to the practice
as
existing
at the present time .
A suit in chancery is commenced by filing in the office
of the clerk of records and writs in chancery a document
called a bill (d) .
This bill, a model of which is given in
the schedule of the consolidated orders above
referred to ,
is
a petition
addressed
to the lord chancellor in a parti-
cular form .
At the head of it appear the
names
of the
parties to the suit , then follows
an address to the person
holding
the great seal , the terms of which
are prescribed
by the court upon every change of the custody of the seal ,
or alteration
in the
style of the person to whom it is
committed .
The
description
and address of the plain-
tiff are then
stated.
After this is set forth
a statement
of all the
facts
and
circumstances , and the purport , or
sometimes even the words of the documents , upon which
the plaintiff intends
to rely .
In this part is introduced
any inference of law or fact which the plaintiff thinks it
advisable to state, and there sometimes is added
that which
the plaintiff
conceives
will be the
defence , together with
the matter which
he thinks sufficient
to avoid such de-
fence.
This stating
part of the bill is succeeded
by the
prayer , in which the plaintiff asks for the particular
relief
(c) 21 & 22 Vict . c. 27 ; 25 & 26
Vict . c. 42 ; 23 & 24 Vict . c. 149.
(d) When the Attorney -General ,
as representing
the crown , is plain-
tiff, the document
filed is called
an
information
, not
being
a petition .
Informations
are
often , but
not
always , filed at the " relation " of
some person who takes the risk as to
costs .
They must , however , always
be
sanctioned
by the
Attorney-
General .

he thinks himself entitled
to , always (e) concluding with a
prayer
for general
relief .
The bill must be

counsel (f) .
It is printed , and a printed copy is filed (g) .
On it there is an
indorsement
equivalent
to a writ
or
command from
her
majesty to the defendant
to cause an
appearance to be entered in the court ( ).
When the bill
has
been filed , a copy of it is stamped by the
clerk
of
records and writs ,
which
is
served
on
the
defendant ;
and if there be more than
one
defendant , such
a copy is
served
on each .
If the defendant be out of the jurisdic-
tion , the court , upon application of the plaintiff, showing
where he probably may be found , will order service upon
him abroad , giving him a reasonable time to appear (i).

the defendant , and thus elicit information
in support of his
case , is to file (k) , and then serve interrogatories () , in which
Interroga-
the plaintiff puts to the defendant such questions relative
to the subject matter of the suit as he thinks proper (m).

to obtain
discovery , and not asking
for any relief , a bill which , now that

law courts have the power
of interrogating
parties , is compara-
tively rare .

IN

Answer.
When interrogatories
have been served, the defendant
is bound to answer them within twenty -eight days (n) , on
pain of imprisonment
; but the
time will be readily
ex-
tended on application
to the court if a sufficient reason be
given .
The
answer to the bill is the
statement of the
defendant made , on oath , in answer to the interrogatories
;
it usually
constitutes the commencement of the defence
to
the suit
in it the defendant is bound
to reply fully to
every question in the interrogatories
.
But besides these
replies , he may also state any facts which he thinks mate-
rial to his defence .
If he have not
been interrogated , he
may if he pleases , within a limited
time (o) , make a volun-
tary answer.
An answer , like a bill, being
an important
part of the pleadings , must
be signed by counsel ; it is ,
like a bill , printed
and filed .
An answer is not however
the only mode of defence .
If any ground of defence
is apparent on the bill itself,
either
from the matter
contained
in it, or from
some
defect in its frame or in the case made by it, the defendant
may , instead of answering it , demur to it ; and this is then
Demurrer.
the proper mode of defence .
A demurrer is an allegation
by a defendant which , admitting
for the purpose of argu-
ment the matters of fact alleged by the bill to be true ,
shows that
as they are
therein
set forth they are insuffi-
cient for the plaintiff to proceed upon , or to oblige the
defendant to answer (p).
The grounds
of demurrer
are
various
;
the
commonest
is ,
that
the
subject
of the
suit is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity , or ,
what is much the same thing , that there is not stated in
the bill such a case
as entitles
the plaintiff to any dis-
covery or relief in
a court of equity : other grounds
are,
that the plaintiff is not entitled
to sue by reason of some
gatories
as
may
be
calculated
to
elicit the truth. It is not essential ,
however , to follow this course .

personal
disability
, or want of interest
on his part ;
or ,
although the plaintiff may have an interest in the subject-
matter , and may be under
no disability , and may have a
good title to sue, yet that the defendant is not the proper
person to be sued
by the plaintiff , either from not having
any interest in the subject -matter of the suit , or from his
not owing any duty to the plaintiff.
Another
ground
of
demurrer is , that complete justice
cannot be done without
other persons than
those made parties to the suit being
before the court (g) ; and that the bill is therefore defec-
tive
for
want
of
parties ,
and
ought
not
to
proceed .
Another , and the last ground of demurrer which we need
here mention , is that of multifariousness
.
The court will
not permit a plaintiff to demand by one bill several mat-
ters of different natures against several defendants , or even ,
where the demands are clearly distinct
in their character ,
against
one
defendant .
A
defendant
may ,
therefore ,
demur to a bill open to this objection (r).
When a demurrer is put in to the bill, and the plaintiff
does not admit
its validity, the case is set down for argu-
(4) The
demurrer
for want
of
parties
was
formerly
a
fruitful
source of annoyance
and
expense .
This has been much
diminished
by
the alteration
made by the legisla-
ture in the rules of the court (15 &
16 Vict . c. 86, s. 42 ; Cons . Order ,
vii . 1, 2).
The
old
rule , requiring
the presence
of every
person
who
was
materially
interested
in the
subject -matter
of the
suit ,
arose
from
the
extreme
anxiety
of the
court
to do complete
justice , and
prevent
future
litigation .
The
strictness
with which it was
ap-
plied
often
led
to great
practical
injustice ,
from
the
difficulty and
expense of complying
with it. This
led
to
its
relaxation
in
several
classes of cases, mentioned
in the
act and the orders .
(r) For illustrations
of the
seve-
ral kinds
of demurrers , see Mitford
on Pleadings , ch . ii. s. 2, p. 1, and
also J. W. Smith's
Notes
thereto .
The demurrer
for want
of equity is
the most
frequent , that for multi-
fariousness
the next .
The skill of
draughtsmen , however , in
prepar-
ing bills, renders demurrers not very
common ; sometimes , however , the
plan of filing a bill in order
that it
may be demurred
to, is adopted
as
a convenient
means
of quickly ob-

ment before the court . If the court thinks the demurrer
is well founded , the decision
is equivalent
to a dismissal
of the bill, and
so terminates
the suit as regards the de-
murring
defendant .
Sometimes , however , the court, whilst
holding
the demurrer to be well founded , yet considers the
circumstances to be such that it ought not to put an end
to the suit , but give the plaintiff an opportunity of making
some alteration
in the statement of his case .
The court
then allows
the demurrer , but gives leave to the plaintiff
to amend his bill.
In such case
the plaintiff usually has
to pay the
costs which have been incurred
by the defen-
dant up to that time . If the demurrer is , in the opinion
of the court , not well founded , it is overruled , and the suit
is in the same condition
as if it had not been put in,
the defendant having , however , generally to pay the costs
occasioned by it.
A third method of defence is by plea .
A plea is of the
nature of an answer to the bill , but is of a special kind ,
having no reference to any interrogatories which may have
been filed .
It may be described
as a statement of some
simple ground of defence , which
does
not appear on the
face of the bill , but which
would if it were in the bill
render it
demurrable .
The grounds
of pleas
are very
much like those of demurrers .
The object of them is to
save
the expense of examination
of witnesses at large ;
therefore it is not
every
good defence in equity
that
is
good as a plea , for where the defence
consists of a variety
of circumstances , it is not proper for a plea , as the court
would be giving judgment on the
case before it is made
out by proof (s).
Pleas
are not much
favoured
by the court , and except
where the fact pleaded is a bankruptcy
of the plaintiff or
defendant , taking
away the right to sue or liability to be
sued , or
some
other equally simple
fact , they are rarely
resorted to, and still more rarely
succeed .

to answer.
If the defendant , not succeeding in either demurrer or
plea , puts in an answer , the plaintiff next considers whether
the answer contains sufficient replies to his interrogatories .
If it does not , he excepts
to the sufficiency of the answer ; Exceptions
which
is done by filing a formal
statement of his objec-
tions , called the exceptions .
The exceptions , which must
show
accurately
wherein
the
answer

are allowed ,

defendant
has
to put in a further
answer .

A plaintiff, after seeing the answer , often finds that the Amendment

such alterations in it as he thinks proper , with

He may also introduce

has occurred
subsequently

A bill may be amended at other
stages
of the
suit besides after answer , and the changes which may be
introduced
by way of amendment are many and various
;
new parties may be added
and former
parties struck out ;
even a party originally plaintiff may be made a defendant ;

relief may
be

leave to amend ; such an order will , before
the defendant has put in his answer , be given as of course
(i. e. without
the defendant
being
allowed
to oppose it),
as often
as the plaintiff
pleases .
After
an answer
has
been put in , one order to amend only will be granted as
of course, and any further
order can only be obtained if
the court , after hearing
the
defendant , thinks
proper to
allow it.
The plaintiff may file interrogatories , and require
an
answer to his amended bill if he pleases
; these new in-
terrogatories are confined , however , to the subject -matter
of the
amendments , but the
same
process for insisting
upon
a sufficient
answer that applied to the original bill
is repeated for the amended bill.
If the defendant wishes to examine the plaintiff in the
same searching manner in which he has himself been
ex-
amined , he may do so .
Formerly in order to do this , he was
obliged
to file a second bill, i. e. institute a second suit ,
called a cross
suit (x) , but now a defendant may , as
soon
as he has put in a sufficient answer (if required to answer) ,
file interrogatories
for the
examination
of the plaintiff,
prefixing
to such
interrogatories
a concise
statement of
the subjects on which discovery is sought .
The plaintiff
is bound to answer such interrogatories , in like manner as
the defendant was bound to answer the plaintiff's interro-
gatories .
When the defendant has answered in an unexception-
able manner , and the plaintiff no longer wishes to amend
his bill , the latter carefully considers the answer , and if he
finds that upon the answer alone , without
further
proof,
there is sufficient ground for a final order or decree (which
rarely happens in hostile
suits ) , he is bound to
proceed

upon the answer without
entering
into

In Hearing on
such a case the
cause
is set down
on bill and
the answer being assumed in the argument to be true (z).
If, however , the plaintiff thinks ,
as usually
happens ,
that evidence beyond the
admissions
in the
answer
is
necessary to support his case , or if the defendant has not
been required to answer , and has not answered, then there
are two distinct
courses
open to the plaintiff, which differ
in their
effects
principally as to the mode in which
the
evidence is taken .
The plaintiff may at once put the cause
in issue, by filing what
is called
a replication (a) , and is
equivalent to traversing
or denying in toto the statements
in the answer .
Or he may serve
a notice of motion for a
decree (b) .
These two modes of bringing the cause to a
hearing we will consider separately , but
before doing
so
it may be here mentioned , that if he has required
an
answer , but the defendant
has neglected to put one in ,
the plaintiff,
besides
taking
steps
to
imprison
him for
contempt in not
answering , may file
a traversing

which is a declaration of his
intention " to proceed with

the parties at the hearing are printed

Sometimes , however ,
it is necessary, either
from
the refusal of a witness
to
make an affidavit , or for some other
reason , to compel a
witness
to
give
evidence
;
when
this is the
case , the
examination
must of course be rivâ voce.
The witness is
served by the party who desires to examine him with
a
writ of subpoena , to appear before one of the examiners of
the court , of whom there are two .
He is then examined ex
parte , no person having
a right
to be present

examination

the witness , his
counsel , solicitor , and

The examination
is put

age, infirmity, or for some
other good reason satisfactory
to the court , incapable of being

When an order of this kind has been
made , the hearing ,
so far as concerns the issue of fact mentioned in the order,
very much resembles
a trial at nisi prius of a common
law action , the judge
taking
both the part of judge
and
jury
a still
greater
resemblance ,
however , is allowed
under the recent improvements of chancery practice , inas-
much as the court may , if it thinks
fit
,
summon
a
jury
to
try before itself any question
of
fact which may arise
in
a
suit
.
This trial by jury
,
however
,
will not
,
unless by con-
sent of counsel on both
sides
,
be directed until the
cause
has been actually brought
to
a

it

if
any

)
is
considered
to
be
closed
,
and the cause
is

cordingly

it

Notice of
motion for
decree.
We come now to the course of preparing
evidence
in
the other case , viz . , where the plaintiff moves for a decree .
The notice of motion which he must give to the defendant
states that one month from its date he will move the court
for a decree (q).
Before serving the notice of motion for
decree , the plaintiff must file all affidavits which he thinks
material for his
purpose , and he must , at the foot of his
notice of motion which he serves upon the defendant , set
forth a list of the affidavits which he intends to use at the
hearing (r) . It follows from this , that ifthe plaintiff wishes
to use the evidence of witnesses who refuse to make affi-
davits on his behalf, he must not proceed in this manner ,
but must file replication
;
because , before giving the notice
of motion , he cannot
subpoena
any
witnesses
, and after
doing
so he is too late ( s).
On the hearing of a motion
for decree , the answer , if there be one, is treated
as an
affidavit (t).
When the defendant has received notice of
motion
for decree , he of
course
has
an opportunity
of
seeing at the
same time the evidence
of his adversary ,
because
he can obtain
copies of the affidavits
from the
office .
He must then , within fourteen days after service
of the notice , file his affidavits in answer to the plaintiff's
case (u).
If he wishes to examine an unwilling witness ,
he has now an opportunity
of doing so ; he serves
a sub-
pœna on the witness to appear before an examiner of the
court (x)
The
examination
in this
case would , it would
in which formerly
the court used to
send an issue to be tried
by a jury

tice which no longer

seem , be conducted in the
presence
of both parties , and
the witness would be subject to cross -examination
and re-
examination (y).
When the defendant
has completed his
evidence and
filed it, the plaintiff has an opportunity
of filing further
evidence in reply .
Seven days are allowed for this (z),
after which time no further
evidence on either side can be
put in to be used
on the
hearing
of the motion
for
decree (a) .
But if either party wishes to
cross -examine
any witness
whose affidavit
has been
filed , he may give
a notice to the party
on whose behalf the
affidavit was
filed of his desire
to cross -examine , and such party must
produce
the
witness
before
an
examiner
to
be
cross-
examined , otherwise he cannot
use the affidavit
without
special leave of the court (b) .
The hearing of the motion for decree in most cases has
the same
effect
as the hearing of the cause (c) .
The court
can either make a decree
exactly as if the cause
had been
brought to a hearing by joining
issue, or it may dismiss
the bill , and so put an end to the suit , to the overthrow of
the plaintiff.
On
comparing
the
method
of
taking
evidence just
described
with
that
where
the
cause
is

replication ,

A SUIT
IN

the evidence in
chief is put in , without
an opportunity
being given to either party of seeing the evidence
in chief
of the other side : but each
side, having power to obtain
copies of all the
evidence
on the file , knows , before the
hearing , all the evidence
that is to be brought against him ,
and has an opportunity
of considering
the course to be
adopted
as
to
cross -examination ;
and he also
has the
great advantage of that
cross -examination
being in open
court .
The only exception to this
previous knowledge
is
where there is to be
a trial of an issue of fact before the
court with a jury , or before the court sitting as both judge
and jury ; in which
case the trial is , as we have already
mentioned , conducted exactly like a trial at nisi prius.
In the
case of motion
for
decree , on the other hand ,
each
side has
an
opportunity
of seeing his
adversary's
evidence
before completing his own.
There is also usually
much
less oral examination , and there is none whatever
before the court .
We have now arrived
at an important
point in the
history
of a suit , that where a decree
is made.
A few
remarks
here arise upon the different
characters
which
suits in
chancery
possess
which lead to very
different
results as to the position which
the litigation
takes at the
time a decree is made and its subsequent history .
There
are many
suits
where
the
object is to obtain
redress
for some grievance , and
as soon
as the grievance
is proved, and an order of the court made for its
redress ,
the whole litigation is
at an end.
In an ordinary action
at law, this is nearly
always
the
case .
The object for
which a man brings an action is damages, and as soon as
a verdict and judgment
have been
arrived at , the plaintiff
has obtained everything which the court can give , nothing
then remaining
to be done in the action except to enforce ,
by the aid of the
sheriff , the execution of the judgment.
But in chancery it is often quite different ; in a very large
number of instances a single order can by no means fulfil
the whole requirements of the suitors .
It often happens ,


THE
DECREE .
101
particularly
in those numerous
suits where the court un-
dertakes
administrative
business , that the action of the
court must be continued for a great length of time , even
for the lifetime of individuals
.
In these cases the decree ,
though in some respects
the most important
order which
the court makes , is not the only order , and indeed is often
not the
order which
decides
the main
questions in con-
troversy between the parties .
It often follows , therefore ,
that when the court makes
a decree in accordance with
the prayer of the bill, or in accordance with what it con-
siders to be the rights
of the parties , there remains still
a great deal for the court to decide .
The suit has a history
subsequent to the decree which
is as important
as that of
the earlier part .
We will take two instances as illustra-
tions .
Suppose a man dies , leaving a number of debts , and
also property
and a creditor thinks it necessary
to require
the
estate
to be administered
by the court , the prayer
which
he makes is, that the
court
shall
undertake
the
administration
.
The creditor in such a suit only
takes
care to satisfy the court that he has a claim , and that the
persons who are made defendants are the persons
in whom ,
by representation ,
either
as executors or administrators
,
devisees , or heirs -at-law, the property of the
deceased
is
legally vested.
The decree which is made in answer to such a prayer is
that
the estate shall
be administered
by the court ; it
also gives directions that certain
inquiries shall be taken
by the
court ,
such
as
an
inquiry
what
property
the
deceased
was possessed
of, where the property is and in
whose possession , what debts
the deceased
owed , and who
are entitled
to the property
subject
to the
payment
of
debts
; and it directs
that the property
be applied
in a
due course of administration
.
The decree of course takes
various forms to suit the particular
circumstances of each
case (d) .
It is obvious in this case that the decree
is but
recently provided peculiar
facilities ,
shortening
the
processes to be gone
(d) The case described in the text
is one for which the legislature
has

the first step towards
attaining
the
object of the
suit .
After the decree
is made, all questions which
arise
as to
the validity of claims
of creditors , the
construction
of
the will, the proofs of heirship , and so on , are decided by
subsequent
proceedings .
Another
case , which
we may
take , does
not at first sight
so clearly show why a final
order may not be made at once .
Suppose
a mortgagee
wish to exercise his right of foreclosing the equity of re-
demption of his mortgagor , that is , make himself absolute
owner of the mortgaged property .
It might seem that , if
he proves by his evidence
that the debt is still owing , and
if, before the decree is made, the mortgagor
does not pay ,
a final decree
might be made.
The
court , however , ac-
cording to its ancient customs , will
not do this except in
very
special
cases (e), or by consent of the parties .
It
always
requires
the accounts
to be
taken
between the
parties in a formal
manner , and gives
the mortgagor
a
very considerable period (always
six months , and usually
nine months ) , after the amount due has been ascertained ,
to pay the money
and it is only after proof of default in
payment at the end of this time that it makes a final order
barring the mortgagor from all interest in the property .
It will be seen that in this case
the course adopted by
the court , arises out of the extreme tenderness of the court
in avoiding the slightest
appearance of a harsh or oppres-
sive exercise of strict legal rights .
Many other
of the
various
complications
which
the
court introduces into its decrees , also arise from the same
anxious desire to do complete justice between the parties ,
and to insist upon the observance by the plaintiff seeking
through
before the
decree is made ,
(see 15 & 16 Vict . c. 86, ss. 45 and
47) ; but the decree, when made, is
exactly of the same character
as it
used to be when the
regular
course
of proceedings was travelled
over .
(e) E.
g. if the
mortgaged
pro-
perty
belong to an infant, and the
mortgage
debt
be
more
than
its
value , and it be proved
clearly
to
the
court that it would
be for the
advantage
of the infant that
the
mortgagee should take the property
in discharge of his debt .

the aid of the court , of the
duty which
he
owes
to the
defendant .
It is with this view , also , that in every pro-
ceeding before the court , the costs incurred
by the parties
are paid in such manner
as the court , which has always
reserved to itself the
most
ample
discretion
upon this
point, directs (f).
A bill is
often
dismissed
without
costs, that is , each
party has to pay his own
costs , even
though the plaintiff fails to establish his case : sometimes ,
even, a victorious
party has to
pay all the costs
of both
sides (g).
Before describing
the course of events
subsequent to
the decree , we must
here revert
to the earlier period of
the
suit , in order
to
notice
certain
proceedings
which ,
though often of the highest
importance , yet are not part
of the regular
course of the suit .
From what
we have
seen , it is obvious that in a hostile
suit there often may
be considerable
delay before the
cause
can be heard and
a decree made.
It seldom happens in such a suit
that
the interval is less than three or four months ; it is often
much longer .
But in many cases
such a delay would be
absolutely
fatal
to the plaintiff's hopes of relief, unless
some
earlier interference
for his
protection could be ob-
tained ;
moreover
the parties
often require , as we have
seen , particular
orders relative
to the conduct of the pro-
ceedings.
The
court , therefore ,
permits
the parties
at
any stage of the suit to make applications
to it.
Such
applications
are made for various
purposes , and may be
made in several ways , either by summons obtained at the
chambers of the judge , in which
case the order is made by
the judge in chambers or his chief clerk , after hearing the
parties on the day when the
summons
is returnable
; or
(f) Very different from the rule
at law , where the defeated party in-
variably
pays all the
costs, except
in the case of nominal
damages .
(g) E. g. , in a simple
redemption
suit the plaintiff pays all the
costs,
even though
he succeeds in redeem-
ing ; though if an improper
defence
be
set
up, the defendant will be
made
to pay any extra
costs occa-
sioned thereby .


104

IN CHANCERY .
by motion
in court ;
or , thirdly , by a formal
petition
addressed to the court .
The summons in chambers is usually
adopted only for
less important matters , and
need not here be dwelt upon .
Formal petitions , for matters of any consequence
, are rarely
presented before decree .
Motions
are the
principal
pro-
ceedings to which
we now refer .
A motion is
a mere
interlocutory
application , and is sometimes made without
giving any notice
to the
other side, but
usually is made
after giving two clear days' notice (h).
We do not intend
here to enumerate all the different
orders which
the
court
will
make
upon
motion
;
the
general principle
is , that if time
is of such importance
that great danger may ensue
unless something
be done.
before the
cause
can come to a hearing , the court will
interfere and make such a temporary order as will prevent
any such disastrous
consequences
; taking
care, however ,
as far as possible , that if, upon the more thorough investi-
gation of the facts which
the
complete evidence given at
the hearing allows , it should turn out that the order made
upon
a motion was wrong , then it can restore the party
against whom such order was obtained to as good a posi-
tion as he was in previously .
If, therefore , the plaintiff asks for
some order which
may prove
detrimental
to the defendant , and , according
to the evidence furnished
upon
the motion , there appears
a possibility
that the detriment
so incurred would
be an
injustice
to the defendant , the court will , as a price for
its early interference , put the plaintiff upon terms to in-
demnify
the
defendant
in
case
of the
injustice
being
proved .
The most common of the important
orders asked for on
motion , are orders for injunctions .
A few words may be
(h) Cons .
Order , xxxiii .

If
an order is obtained without
giving
notice , the
other
side may make
a
motion
to discharge
it ; a motion
made upon notice cannot be so dis-
charged ,
as
the
merits
are
dis-
cussed, each side bringing forward
its evidence .

INJUNCTIONS

said as to these , which will illustrate
the proceeding by
motion .
An injunction
is a writ issuing out of the court ,
commanding the person against whom it is
addressed
to
abstain
from
doing
some specified thing, upon
pain
of
imprisonment
for contempt of court .
When the injunc-
tion is to restrain the defendant from
proceeding with an
action in a court of law, or some
other court , it has been
called a common injunction .
When it restrains
the de-
fendant from doing
some specified act, such
as
cutting
down
timber , digging
mines , infringing a copyright
or
trade mark , it is called
a special injunction .
Formerly
there was some
difference between the practice in respect
to the two kinds of injunctions
, but now the distinction is
unimportant (i) .
An
injunction
will not , before decree ,
be granted unless there is a special prayer in the bill for
When it is intended
to move
for an injunction , a
notice is served
upon the defendant , stating that counsel
will move the court on a named day , which must be one
of the days which
are
set apart
for
motions
(k).
Each
side then has an opportunity of filing affidavits in support
of or against the motion , and this evidence
can continue
to be put in until the motion
is heard .
On the motion
days the court
asks
each
counsel in turn , according
to
seniority (), whether he moves anything , and thereupon
counsel makes the motion in the terms of the notice , and
the argument
ensues
; but there is no previous formality
of setting it down with the registrars , as is done when the
cause is heard (m).

(k) Special
orders
can in proper
cases be obtained varying

prac-
tice, so as, for instance , to allow a
motion
to be brought
on upon
a
day not one of the seal days .

day of term it is
usual for the court to call

notice of it given to the defendant , he is bound to obey
it, although
the writ itself be not issued till later .
Injunctions
granted
on motion
before
decree
will , in
accordance with what has been said , only be of a tempo-
rary character , generally until the hearing of the cause or
further order .
Sometimes , however , the discussion on the
motion
involves
the whole
merits of the
suit ; in such a
case it is not uncommon for the parties
to agree that the
motion
be
treated
as the hearing , all formalities
being
waived .
To this the court
readily consents , and in such
a case a chancery suit may be instituted
and ended within
the space of a few days.
When there no longer
remains any property under the
control of the court , and no further
question between the
parties arising
out of the certificates made in the inquiries
in chambers , a suit in chancery comes
to an end. It often
happens , however , that before that consummation of events
can be arrived at, proposals are made for
a compromise .
Of course if all the parties interested are sui juris , a com-
promise may be made at any time without
the sanction of
the court ; but where , as in chancery so often is the case ,
infants
or married women are interested , a compromise of
doubtful
rights
can only be made with the permission of
the court .
This is given if, after a full disclosure of the
facts , the court
is satisfied
that it will be for the real
benefit of the person so under its protection that the com-
promise should be carried out (n) , in which
case alone will
the compromise be binding.
The proceedings which take place after a decree is made
will not detain us long .
They consist usually of the fol-
lowing
:-first, a prosecution of inquiries
into facts , such
as
pedigrees , titles
to property , and accounts .
This is
done in the chambers of the judges by their chief clerks :
except where any point of difficulty arises , when the matter

is brought
before the judge
himself ; for which
purpose
the judges , i. e. the master of the rolls and the vice-chan-
cellors (not the judges
of the
court
of appeal , for they
only sit in court ) , attend in
chambers in the
afternoon
after the rising of the court.
As soon as these inquiries
and accounts have been
finished , a certificate is made out
by the chief clerk stating
the result (o) .
This forms the
basis of fact for the subsequent
steps
in the cause , the
principal
of which is the further
consideration .
The party
who has the carriage of the
decree , i. e. the plaintiff in
many though
not all
cases ,
sets
down the cause to be
heard upon further
consideration , and it takes its place in
the court paper, and is called on in court in its turn .
It
is on this second hearing , if we may so term
it , that in
administration
suits the great
contest upon the construc-
tion of wills or other similar
documents takes place .
The
certificate informs the court of all the persons who can set
up any claim ;
and each
person
mentioned in the certifi-
cate , and having a possible interest , appears
at the hearing
of the further
consideration
by his counsel and argues in
support of his rights .
It is to be noticed , that under the
modern practice , a
decree
may be made in a suit for the
administration
or protection
of property (p) , with only a
few of the persons interested being parties .
But the court
requires that all persons who by the chief clerk's
certifi-
cate are shown to have any interest , or possible interest ,
should be served with notice of the
decree , so that they
may be bound
by the
proceedings , and
that
they may
have an opportunity
of appearing
at the further
conside-
ration .
A suit cannot in many cases be entirely disposed
of even on the further
consideration , because it may be

that persons who finally become
entitled
to the corpus of
the estate which
is being administered , may at that time
not even be born .
A suit in such
cases
necessarily re-
mains in a quiescent state for years, the property being ,
however , retained under the protection of the court . When
through the happening
of events , such as the deaths of
tenants
for life , or the
attainment
of their majority by
infants , it becomes
necessary again
to
come
to the court
for an order ; the usual mode of obtaining
the order is by
the
presentation of a petition .
A petition , as we have
before said, may be presented at any stage of the suit , the
most important
petitions are those to which we now refer ,
the
object of which
is to obtain
an order for the pay-
ment or transfer of money or
stock in the hands of the
accountant -general of the court , to which money or stock ,
by such events
as above -mentioned , a new title has accrued
to some person , or an order for conveyance of lands under
similar circumstances .
Petitions
state all
the
facts fully , though
concisely .
They are presented to the lord -chancellor (except in the
case of one intended
to be heard by the
master of the
rolls
when it is
presented to
that judge ) , who
receives
them
by his
secretary.
The
petition is
indorsed
by
the secretary with a direction that all parties should attend
the court on a day named : this is called answering
the
petition . A copy of the petition is then served upon all par-
ties interested , and on the proper day it appears
in the court
paper , and is called on in its turn .
It must be supported
by evidence which consists either of certificates previously
made in the cause , or formal
evidence of the facts upon
which the title in question depends.
The court exercises
considerable
caution
in
making
the
order , and
herein
consists
the great
value
of
an
administration
by the
court (g).
(q) The court however necessarily
relies , to no inconsiderable
extent ,
upon the faith reposed in solicitors ,
which , when
abused,
may lead
to
disastrous
consequences .
It there-
fore requires , under penalty of their

SUMMARY
APPLICATIONS
.
109
We have thus traced the history of a suit through
all
the stages of its progress : many of these by consent of
the parties , or the
natural
requirements
of the
case , are
often omitted , and the duration of the suit proportionately
shortened .
It only
remains
here to notice
those
cases
where , by special
legislative
enactment , proceedings in
chancery are taken either by a shortened form of suit , or
by summary application
without
suit .
Where the object
of the suit is the
administration
of the personal estate of
a deceased
person , or even in certain cases his real estate ,
a decree
for the administration
may be obtained without
filing a bill , but by a simple summons in chambers served
upon the
executor
or administrator
, or a devisee of real
estate entrusted by the will with a power of sale (r) .
From
what we have recently
said , in these
cases
the
main value of the proceedings
depends upon what takes
place after
decree , therefore
it is
a great
advantage
to
avoid the delay and expense of the pleadings
and other
matters which in a regular
suit
precede
the
decree .
In
most of the other cases to which
reference was made in
the last chapter (s) , the summary application
to the court
is made by a petition , entitled
or
headed with the name
of the act, and of the name of the subject -matter of the
proceeding .
The
only
case
in which
a
summary appli-
cation of this kind is , according to the practice , made by
a simple motion , is where the application
is to rectify the
register of a joint - stock company , under the 35th section
of the Companies ' Act , 1862.
But sometimes the method
of proceeding by summons , for the purpose of originating
proceedings , is adopted, as in a case under the Charitable
Trust Act , 1853 (t).

CHAPTER
VII.
THE SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF
LAW .
FOLLOWING the plan indicated
in the
three preceding
chapters , we shall next
consider
the
superior
courts of
common law, their jurisdiction
, and the proceedings in an
action
of which
subjects that first mentioned
will , in
anticipation
of organic changes in this part of our system
of judicature , be very briefly noticed .
By the ancient
Saxon constitution
there was only one
superior
court of justice in the kingdom
; and that
court
had cognisance both of civil and
spiritual causes
: viz.
the wittena-gemote , or general
council , which
assembled
annually or oftener , wherever the king kept his Christmas ,
Easter , or Whitsuntide , as well to do private justice
as to
consult
upon
public
business .
After the Conquest the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction was gradually
diverted
into an-
other channel ; and a court was established which sat in
the king's hall , thence called by Bracton (a) , and other
ancient
authors , aula regia , or aula regis (b).
This
court
(a) L. 3, tr. 1, c. 7.
(b) This
court (says Mr. Millar ,
Eng. Gov.
vol . ii. p. 108) corres-
ponded in constitution
and origin
with that tribunal which , after
the
accession of Hugh Capet , was gra-
dually formed
out
of the ancient
parliament
of France .
It corres-
ponded also with the Aulic
council
which , after the time of Otho the
Great , arose out of the Diet of the
German
Empire .
There
is reason
to believe that in every considerable
European
kingdom
the progress of
the
feudal
system
gave
rise
to a
similar
institution , which became
detached from the national
council
by connivance , rather than by any
positive
appointment
.
The same
writer
remarks
that , although
in
England
the
institution
of
the
King's
Council is
commonly
as
cribed
to William
the Conqueror ,
yet this must
be understood
with

was composed of the king's
great officers
of state resident
in his palace , and usually attendant on his person : such
as the lord high constable and lord
marshal , who chiefly
presided in matters of honour
and of arms ; determining
according to the law military and the law of nations .
Besides
these,
there
were
the
lord
high
steward ,
and
lord great chamberlain
;
the steward of the
household ;
the
lord
chancellor (c) ;
and
the
lord
treasurer ,
who
was the principal adviser in all matters relating to the
revenue.
These
high
officers were
assisted
by certain
persons learned
in
the laws , who were called the king's
justiciars or justices ; and by the greater barons of parlia-
ment , who sat in the aula regia , and formed
a kind of
court of appeal , or rather
of advice , in matters of great
moment and difficulty
.
All these in their
several
depart-
ments transacted secular business , criminal and civil , and
likewise
attended to matters connected
with the revenue :
whilst over all presided
one special magistrate , called the
chief justiciar (d)
or capitalis justiciarius totius Angliæ ;
who was also the principal
minister
of state, the second
man in the kingdom , and by virtue of his office
guardian
of the realm in the king's
absence .
This
officer, from
the plenitude of his power , grew at length both obnoxious
to the people and
dangerous
to the government
which
employed him (e).

loco
certo ."
This
certain
place was
established
at Westminster
, where the
aula
regis originally sat, when the king resided in that
city ;
and to this article of the great charter we owe the insti-
tution of the court of common pleas , which has ever
since
remained stationary in Westminster
Hall.
In like man-
ner , Philip the Fair , king of France , about the year 1302
fixed the parliament of Paris to abide constantly in that
metropolis ; which before used to follow the person of the
king wherever he went , and in which he himself used
frequently
to decide the causes that were there depending ;
but all were then
referred to the
sole
cognisance of the
parliament
and
its
learned
judges .
And
thus
also in
1495 ,
the
emperor
Maximilian
I.
fixed
the
imperial
chamber (which before always travelled with the court and
household ) to be constantly held at Worms, whence it was
afterwards translated to Spire (f). Over the court of com-
mon pleas a chief judge and other justices were appointed ;
with jurisdiction to hear and determine all pleas of land ,
and wrongs
merely
civil
between
subject
and
subject .
Which
critical
establishment of this
principal
court of
common law, at that particular
juncture
and that
parti-
cular
place , gave rise to the inns of court in its neigh-
bourhood ;
and ,
thereby
collecting
together
the
whole
body of the
common
lawyers , enabled the law itself to
withstand
the attacks of the canonists
and civilians , who
laboured to extirpate and destroy it (g) .
The aula regia being thus stripped
of so considerable
a branch of its jurisdiction
, and the power of the
chief
justiciar
being
also
considerably
curbed
by the
great
charter , the
authority
of both
began to decline
apace
under
the
long
and
troublesome
reign
of Henry III.
And the
other several
offices
of the chief justiciar were
under Edward I.
(who new modelled the frame of our
judicial
polity )
subdivided
and broken
up

THEIR
ORIGIN .
113
courts of judicature .
A court of
chivalry
was
erected ,
over which
the constable and marshal
presided ;
as did
the steward of the household over another , constituted
to
regulate the king's domestic servants .
The high steward ,
with the barons of parliament , formed an august tribunal
for the trial of delinquent
peers
; and the barons reserved
to themselves in parliament
the right of reviewing
the
sentences
of other courts in the last resort .
The distri-
bution
of common
justice , moreover ,
between
man
and
man was thrown into so provident an order, that the great
judicial
officers were made to form
a check upon
each
other : the
court
of chancery
issuing
writs
framed in
accordance
with
established
precedents
and
under
the
great seal to the other courts ( ) ; the common pleas being
allowed to determine
causes between private subjects ; the
exchequer managing the royal
revenue ; and the court of
king's bench (2) retaining
such portion of the jurisdiction
of the aula regis as was not cantoned out to other courts ,
and particularly
the sole cognisance of pleas of the crown
or
criminal
causes .
For
pleas
or
suits
are regularly
divided
into
two
sorts : " pleas
of the
crown ,"
which
comprehend all crimes
and
misdemeanors , wherein
the
crown (on behalf of the
public ) is the
plaintiff ;
and
" common
pleas ," which
include
all
civil
actions
de-
pending
between
subject
and
subject.
The
former
of
these were originally
within the exclusive jurisdiction
of
the
court
of king's bench , the
latter
of the
court
of
common
pleas, which is a court of record , and is styled
by sir Edward
Coke (k) the lock and key of the common
law ; for therein only can real actions , as to which we shall
hereafter
inquire ,
be brought
: and all
other , or merely
personal , pleas between man and man
are likewise
there
determinable
; though in regard
to
these latter
the two
other superior courts have now concurrent authority .

court of exchequer

first to have

feudal

were owing to him,

issuing

This statute , however , failed in consequence
of an artifice in effecting its object , for it was held not to
apply to suits
between subjects who were debtors to the
crown , and any suitor was permitted
falsely to suggest in
the process which he sued
out that he was such a debtor ,

The court of exchequer is presided over by a lord chief

its jurisdiction over
ordinary
personal
actions ,
peculiar
and
exclusive
cognisance
of
matters
of
revenue (0)—
matters involving the payment of stamp , succession , or
other duties

arising

the laws regulating
the customs and excise brought before
it by information

an

touching
any of the
matters just

court to proceed
elsewhere in respect of any matter which
lies within

COURTS
OF LAW.
Queen's
Bench.
the county or shire
court , and by the hundred
court (r) ,
assizes
were , so early as the reign of Hen. I. , occasionally
held by justices itinerant , and a practice was early resorted
to of issuing special commissions of oyer and terminer at
the suit of individuals
when
any
extraordinary
outrage
had
been
committed .
However ,
appeals
lay in
many
cases to the king's council
from decisions of the justices ,
and great expense
and delay must have been thus
occa-
sioned to suitors
who
were
compelled
to resort to the
supreme court .
The hardship thus caused was partially
remedied
by the
provision
in
Magna
Carta
already
noticed ( 8) , in virtue whereof
the common
pleas became
stationary
at Westminster.
Nevertheless ,
suitors
were
still compelled to come thither for justice
from very dis-
tant places , and to remedy this inconvenience the statute
of Westm. II.
( 13 Edw .
1 ,
c.
10 ) was
passed , which
enacted , that any person impleaded
before the justices
at
Westminster
, or at the
assizes , might make
a general
attorney to sue for him .
And to this statute it is thought
that the habitual
employment of attornies of right in the
courts at Westminster
may properly
be ascribed (t).
The
court of common
pleas has at this day a special
cognisance of real
actions ( u) .
It is also the
court of
appeal from the decisions of revising barristers under the
6 & 7 Vict . c. 18 ; further it has some peculiar functions
to discharge under the act for the abolition of fines and
recoveries
(x) , and under " the Railway
and Canal Traffic
Act , 1854 " (y) .
The court of queen's bench ( so called because
the sove-
reign used formerly
to sit there in person , or at all events
was theoretically
present there , the style of the court still
being
coram
ipsâ
reginâ ,)
is
(irrespective
of
appellate
tribunals )

kingdom , consisting
of a
chief
justice
and
five
puisne
justices ( ), who
are by their office the sovereign conser-
vators of the peace , and supreme coroners of the land
(a) .
Yet though the sovereign did occasionally , in early times ,
sit in this court (b) , he did not , nor could he determine
any cause or motion but by the mouth of his duly consti-
tuted judges (c).
The court of queen's bench , which (as we have said ) is
the remnant of the aula regia , is not , nor can it be, from
its very nature and constitution , fixed to any certain place,
but may follow the queen's person wherever she goes . It
has indeed , for some
centuries
past , usually
sat at West-
minster ,
being
an
ancient
palace
of
the
crown ;
but
might remove with the sovereign to York or Exeter, if she
thought
proper to command it.
And we find that , after
Edward
I.
had
conquered
Scotland , it
actually
sat at
Roxburgh (d).
And this moveable quality , as well as its
dignity and power , are fully expressed by Bracton , when
he says
that
the
justices
of this
court
are " capitales ,
generales , perpetui , et majores ; a latere regis residentes , qui
omnium aliorum corrigere tenentur
injurias
et errores ” (e).
And it is moreover especially provided in the articuli super
cartas (f) , that the king's chancellor , and the justices of
his bench shall follow him, so that he
may have at all
times near unto him some that
be learned in the laws .
The court of queen's
bench takes cognisance both of cri-
minal and civil causes ; the former in what
is called the

mas term in the

of king's
bench ; but it is not said
that
he
interfered
in

business
of the
court ; and
as he was then a very
young
man , it is probable
that it
was his intention
to learn in what
manner
justice
was
administered ,
rather
than to
act the part
of a
judge ."

crown side or crown office ; the latter in the plea side of
the court .
The jurisdiction
of the crown side it is not our
present business to consider ; that will be more properly dis-
cussed in the ensuing Volume .
On the plea side , or civil
branch , this court had originally jurisdiction
and cognisance
of all actions of trespass or other injury alleged to be com-
mitted vi et armis ; of actions for forgery of deeds , main-
tenance , conspiracy , deceit , and actions on the case which
alleged falsity or fraud , all of which were deemed
to savour
of a criminal nature , and made the defendant
liable
in
strictness to pay a fine to the crown , as well as damages to
the injured party (9).
The
origin of the action on the
case has been already stated
(h ) , and of this form of action
the court claimed
cognisance , on the ground
that it was
for a trespass ; and thus assumed
jurisdiction over a large
class of cases , comprising
injuries
consequential upon but
not directly
caused
by tort.
And gradually it still further
extended its jurisdiction to actions of debt , covenant (¿) ,
and so forth , by allowing
a plaintiff, in the first instance ,
to
complain
of a
trespass
against
the defendant ;
and
afterwards , when
he had thus
brought
him into court ,
permitting
the plaintiff to waive his
charge of trespass ,
and to
declare
against the
defendant , for some matter
purely civil in its nature (k).

(k) To explain
this
more fully ,
the
court
amplified
its,jurisdiction
in
the
manner
following
:-This
court
might
always
have held plea
of any personal action , provided
the
defendant
was
an
officer
of the
court ;
or in
the
custody
of
its
marshal , or prison
keeper ; for a
breach
of the
peace
or
any
other
offence.
And in process of time it
began by a fiction
to hold plea of
all personal actions whatsoever , and
has continued
to do so for ages : it
having
been surmised
that the de-
fendant
was arrested for a supposed
trespass , which
he
never
had
in
reality committed
; and
being thus
in the custody of the marshal of the
court , the
plaintiff
was
held
at
liberty to proceed
against
him for
any
other
personal
injury :
this
surmise , of being in the marshal's
custody , the defendant
was not
at
liberty to dispute .
This fiction
was
abolished
by the

THEIR

The actual jurisdiction of the court of queen's bench is
very high and transcendent .
It has cognisance of all per-
sonal actions
and actions of ejectment , with the various
proceedings
collateral
and
ancillary
thereto .
It is the
principal
criminal
court in the realm .
It keeps all inferior
criminal jurisdictions
within the bounds of their autho-
rity ,
and
may
either
remove
their
proceedings
to
be
determined
there , or prohibit their
progress below .
superintends
all civil corporations
in the kingdom .
commands magistrates and others
to do what their duty
requires , in every
case where there is no specific remedy .
It
protects
the
liberty
of the
subject ,
by
speedy
and
summary
interposition .
It is
also a court of error (1)
from the palatinate
courts , and of appeal from those courts
for the purposes of the undermentioned
statutes (m).

pleas, or the king's serjeant .
The judges
usually
make
their circuits in the respective vacations after Hilary and
Trinity terms , and sit by virtue of four

HOW THEY EXERCISE JURISDICTION.
121
Such
being
a brief résumé
of the jurisdiction of our
superior courts of law, three points
connected with it are
especially to be noticed :-
1. It is incumbent
on each court to entertain and adjudi-
cate upon any suit or matter regularly in contention before
it ; provided
such suit
or matter
be not
so frivolous
as
to involve a mere waste of time in its investigation
; nor
of such a nature , as to lead to enquiries
inconsistent with
public
decency ,
or with the dignity of justice
: for the
rule stated by our ancient writers is non recedant
quærentes
à curia regis sine remedio (r) .
2. Each of our superior courts
is bound to keep within
the
limits of its jurisdiction .
The
consent of
parties.
would
not
suffice
to make operative
a judgment
of the
court of common
pleas on a crown
case , or of the court
of queen's bench in a real action ;
because
the particular
tribunal
specified would
have no power to entertain
the
case before it : the whole
proceeding would
be illusory,
and lead to no result in legal contemplation
(s).
3. It is not
competent to parties , by any stipulation
between themselves , to oust the jurisdiction
of the courts .
The precise meaning , however , of this
expression " oust-
ing the jurisdiction
of the courts," deserves
attention . It
means , that
when
a cause
of action has accrued, parties
cannot by contract
say that there shall not be jurisdiction
to
enforce damages in respect
thereof .
Parties
cannot
enter into a contract which
gives rise to a right of action
for the breach of it, and then withdraw
such a case from
the jurisdiction of the ordinary
tribunals .
Parties
may ,
however , enter into
a contract , such that no breach of it
shall occur until after
a reference has been made to arbi-
tration (t).

a

commission

take

of pleas pending in the exchequer .

THE
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
Appellate
courts.
Exchequer
chamber.
With regard to the three rules
stated
as applicable to
our superior
courts
of original
or primary
jurisdiction ,
we observe , that they rest on grounds of manifest
policy
and expediency .
Our courts cannot refuse to listen and do
justice
to
a suitor
who in
a respectful
and becoming
manner , and with due regard to the recognised method of
procedure , brings before them his complaint .
Our courts
cannot assume and exercise jurisdiction , even by consent.
of parties , beyond those limits within which
alone they
have been authorised
and
commissioned
to do justice .
Lastly , it is not compatible with the dignity of our superior
courts , that their jurisdiction
should be set aside.
The briefest
allusion will
here suffice to our appellate
courts ,
one
principal
use
of which is to
prevent the
law from being
changed .
Were there no such superior
tribunals , it would be easy for judges , by construction and
interpretation ,
to
change
even a written
law ;
and
yet
more easy would it be for them to change our customary
unwritten
law , which depends upon usage solely (u).
The court of exchequer chamber derives its origin from
the stats. 31 Edw . 3 , st. 1 , c. 12 (x) , and 27 Eliz . c. 8 , and
was first established to hear and determine causes brought
with A. to do particular
acts, and
make
default , and
afterwards
it is
covenanted
between
us
that
any
question
arising
as
to
breach
of
covenants
shall
be referred
to arbi-
tration , that latter
covenant
does
not prevent
the
covenantee
from
bringing an action .
A right of ac-
tion having
accrued , it would
be
against the policy of the law to give
effect to an agreement
that
such
a
right should not be enforced through
the
medium
of
the
ordinary
tri-
bunals .
But if I covenant with A. ,
hat if I do, or omit to do a certain
act, I will pay to him such
a sum
as T. S. shall award as the
amount
of damage
sustained
by him, then
until T. S. has made his award , and
I have
omitted
to
pay the
sum
awarded , my covenant has not been
broken , and no right of action
has
arisen
against
me.
Nor
does the
policy
of the law prevent
parties
from so contracting .

CHAPTER
VIII .

OF
THE
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
WRONGS
AFFECTING
THE
PERSON- REPUTATION - LIBERTY
AND
RELATIVE
RIGHTS .
THE
jurisdiction
exercised
by
our
superior
courts
of
common law will in this
and
some ensuing
chapters
be
considered ; and in treating
of it I shall at first
confine
myself to such wrongs
and
breaches
of contract
as may
be committed in the mutual
intercourse
between subject
and
subject
which
the
sovereign ,
as
the
fountain
of
justice , is officially bound to redress
in the ordinary forms
of law
reserving such injuries
or encroachments
as may
occur between the crown and the subject , to be considered
hereafter , since the remedy in such cases is generally of a
somewhat peculiar and eccentrical nature .
Now,
since all wrong
may be considered as
merely a
privation
of
right,
the
plain
natural
remedy
for
every
species of wrong
is the being put in
possession
of that
right, whereof the party
injured
is deprived .
This
may
either be effected
by a specific delivery
or restoration of
the subject-matter in dispute to the legal owner ;
as when
lands
or personal
chattels
are unjustly
withheld
or in-
vaded :: or, where that is not a possible , or at least not an
adequate remedy , by
making
the
sufferer
a
pecuniary
satisfaction in damages ;
as in case of assault , or breach
of
contract , to
which
damages
the
party
injured
has
acquired an incomplete or inchoate right, the instant
he
receives the injury, or has to complain
of the
breach of
contract ; though
such right be not fully ascertained till
damages are assessed by the intervention
of the law.
The
mode whereby
this
remedy is obtained , is in general
a

Three kinds
of actions.
Personal
action.
suit or action defined by the Mirror (a) to be " the lawful
demand of one's right : " and a right of action is , accord-
ing to Bracton and Fleta , using the words of Justinian (b ) ,
jus prosequendi injudicio quod alicui
debetur .
The Romans early introduced
set forms for actions
and
suits in their law, after the example of the Greeks
; and
made it a rule , that each injury should be redressed
by its
proper remedy only . " Actiones," say the pandects , " com-
posita sunt, quibus
inter
se homines
disceptarent :
quas
actiones ,
ne populus
prout
vellet
institueret,
certas
solen-
nesque
esse voluerunt " (c).
The forms of these actions were
originally preserved in the books of the pontifical
college ,
as choice and inestimable
secrets
; till one Cneius Flavius,
the secretary of Appius Claudius , stole
a copy and pub-
lished
them to
the people (d).
The
concealment
was
ridiculous
but
the establishment of some standard
was
undoubtedly
necessary , to fix the true state of a question
of right ; lest in a long and arbitrary
process it might be
shifted continually
, and be at length no longer discernible .
Or , as Cicero
expresses
it
( e) , " sunt jura , sunt formulæ ,
de
omnibus
rebus constitutæ , ne quis aut in genere injuriæ ,
aut ratione actionis, errare possit .
Expressæ
enim sunt ex
uniuscujusque damno , dolore , incommodo , calamitate, injuriâ ,
publica a prætore formulæ , ad quas privata
lis
accommo-
datur
."
With
us
in England the
several
suits
,
or
remedial
instruments
of
justice
,
are distinguished
into three kinds
;
actions personal
,
real
,
and mixed
.
A
personal action
is
that whereby
a
man claims
a
debt
,
or
seeks
to
recover
damages
for breach
of
contract
,
or
of
some personal
duty
:
and
likewise
,
whereby
a
man
claims
a
satisfaction
in
damages for
some
wrong done
to
his person
or
property
.
The former
is
,
in
general
,
founded
on contract
,
the latter upon tort

action.
A mixed action partakes of the nature of the other two , Mixed
for therein some real property is demanded , and personal
damages also may often be recovered
.
To one or other of the
above
three heads may every
species of remedy by suit or action in a court of common
law
be referred .
But in order
effectually
to
apply the
remedy , it is first necessary to ascertain the complaint . I
proceed
therefore now to enumerate the several kinds , and
to
enquire
into the respective
natures
of
such
private
wrongs
and breaches
of contract as
are of practical
con-
cern ; for to enumerate every infraction
of right would
be
impossible .
In treating this subject , I shall adopt the same method
that was pursued with regard to the distribution
of rights :
for as wrongs
are
nothing
else but an infringement
or
breach of those rights , which
we have before laid down
and
explained , it will follow that
this
negative
system ,
of wrongs , must
correspond
and tally with the former
positive system , of rights .
As therefore , we divided (g)
rights
into
those of persons , and
those of things , so we
must make the same
general distribution
of injuries
into
such as affect the rights
of persons , and such
as affect,
directly or indirectly , the rights of property .
The rights
of persons , we may remember , were distri-
buted
into
absolute
and
relative :
absolute , which
were
such as appertained
and belonged
to private men , consi-
dered merely as individuals , or single persons ; and relative ,
which were incident
to them
as members of society, and
connected to each other by various ties and relations (h) .

:
and , III .
The
right of private
pro-
perty ( ) ; so that the wrongs
or injuries
affecting
them ,
must consequently be of a correspondent nature .
I. Injuries which affect the personal security of an indi-
vidual , are either against his life , his limbs , his body, his
health , or his reputation .
1. With regard
to injuries
affecting the life of man,
they do not , except as noticed at page 150 , fall under our
present
contemplation
; being
one of the most atrocious
species
of crimes , the subject of the next
volume of our
Commentaries .
2 , 3. The two
next
species
of
injuries ,
affecting
the
limbs
or bodies of individuals
, I shall consider in one and
the same view .
And these may be committed :
( 1. ) By
assault ; which is an attempt or offer to beat another , with-
out touching
him : as if one lifts up his cane , or his fist ,
in a threatening
manner at another ; or
strikes
at him ,
but misses him ; this is an assault , insultus , which Finch ( )
describes to be " an unlawful setting upon
one's person .'
This is
an inchoate violence
; and
therefore , though
no
actual suffering
be proved , yet the party injured may have
redress by action
of trespass ;
wherein
he may recover
damages as a compensation for the injury.
(2.) By battery ;
which
is the
unlawful beating
of
another .
The least
touching
of another's
person wilfully , or in anger , is a
battery ;
for the
law
cannot
draw
the
line
between
different
degrees of
violence ,
and therefore totally pro-
hibits the first and lowest stage of it ; every man's person
being sacred , and no other having
a right to meddle with
it, in any the slightest manner . Battery is, however , in some
cases , justifiable
or lawful
; as where one who has authority ,
a parent or master , gives moderate correction to his child ,

129
:
his scholar , or his apprentice .
So also on the principle of
self-defence
for if one strikes
me first ,
or
even
only
assaults
me, I may
strike
in my own defence ; and, if
sued for doing
so , may plead
son assault demesne , or that
it was the plaintiff's own original
assault that
occasioned
mine .
So likewise in defence
of my goods or possession :
if a man endeavours to deprive me of them, I may justify
laying
hands upon him to prevent him ; and in case he
persists with violence , I may proceed
to beat him away (1).
Thus too in the exercise of his
office , a churchwarden
or
beadle may lay hands
upon
another to turn him
out of
church , and to prevent his disturbing
the congregation (m) .
And if sued for this or the like battery , he may set forth
the whole
case , and plead that
he laid hands upon the
plaintiff gently , molliter manus imposuit , for such purpose .
On
account of
these
causes
of justification
, battery is
defined to be the unlawful
beating of another ; for which
the remedy is, as for assault , by action of trespass
, wherein
adequate
damages are recoverable .
A battery
may
be aggravated by wounding
or may-
hem ,
which ,
according to its
strict
technical
meaning ,
consists
in violently
depriving
another of the use of
a
member proper for his defence
in fight (n).
Any bodily
hurt , whether caused by direct violence , or resulting
from
negligence , is , if adequate
ground
of excuse
or justifica-
tion be wanting , actionable .

Mala
praxis , indeed , may constitute an offence
at common law,
whether it be for curiosity
and experiment , or by neglect ;
and is especially reprehensible , because it breaks the trust
which the party had placed in his physician , and tends to
the patient's
destruction (q) .
Thus
also, in the Roman
law (r) , neglect and want of skill in physicians or surgeons ,
" culpæ adnumerantur , veluti si medicus
curationem
dere-
liquerit , male quempiam secuerit , aut perperam ei medica-
mentum
dederit."
The above are wrongs or injuries
un-
accompanied by force, for each of which there is a remedy.
in damages
by action on the
case , a remedy available for
a personal wrong
or injury without force.
In very early
times methods were prescribed , and forms of actions settled ,
for redressing
those wrongs , which
most
usually
occur ,
and in which the very act itself is immediately prejudicial
or injurious
to the plaintiff's
person or property , as bat-
tery,
non -payment of a debt, detaining
one's goods or
the like ;
and where
any special
consequential
damage
arose , which could not be foreseen and provided for in the
ordinary
course
of justice , the party injured was allowed ,
both
at common law and by the
statute of Westm .
2 ,
c. 24, to bring a special action on his own case , by a writ
formed according to the peculiar circumstances of his own
particular
grievance (s).
For wherever the
common law
gives a right or prohibits
an injury, it also gives a remedy
by action (t) ;
and
therefore , wherever
a new injury is
done, a new method of remedy must be pursued .
And it
is a settled distinction , that where an act is done which is
in itself an immediate
injury to another's
person , there
the remedy is usually
by an action of trespass ; but where
there is no act done, but only
a culpable
omission ;
or
where the act is not immediately
injurious , but only by
consequence
and collaterally
; there no action of trespass

that

)
would
endanger the life

But too

it

now held that for scandalous

an action on the case will lie
,
without
proving
any particular
damage
to

.
But
with regard
to
words that
do not
thus
apparently
,
and
upon the face
of
them
,
import such defamation

Words spoken
in derogation of a peer, judge , or other
great officer of the realm , were formerly
called scandalum
magnatum , and were held to be especially heinous (c) : and
though
such as would not be actionable in the
case of a
common person , yet when spoken in disgrace of these high
and respectable
characters , were held to amount to an
atrocious injury ; which was redressed by an action on the
case founded
on several ancient
statutes (d ) ;
as well
on
behalf of the
crown , to inflict punishment
on the slan-
derer, as
on behalf of the party , to compensate him by
damages for the injury sustained .
The action for scanda-
lum
magnatum is
now
obsolete
, but words tending to
scandalize a magistrate , member of parliament , or person
in an eminent position , or in a public trust, are reputed
to be in general more highly injurious
than when spoken
of a private
man , and may render the individual
who has
promulgated
the slander punishable
on criminal
informa-
tion (e).
Mere scurrility , or opprobrious
words , without
damage,
will not support an action ; neither will words of heat and
passion do so , if productive of no
ill
consequence
:
nor are
words
spoken
in
a
friendly manner
,
as
by way
of
advice
,
admonition

be able to justify , and prove the words
to be true , no
action will lie () , even though special damage has ensued :
for then it is no
slander
or false
tale .
Thus , if I can
prove the tradesman
a bankrupt , the physician
a quack ,
or the lawyer a knave , this will furnish a defence to their
respective actions : for though
there may be damage ac-
cruing
from it, yet, if the fact
be true , it is damnum
absque injuriâ ; and where there is no injury, the law , as
a general
rule , gives no remedy .
And this is agreeable
to the reasoning of the Roman law (k) : " eum qui
nocen-
tem infamat , non
est æquum
et bonum
ob eam rem condem-
nari ; delicta enim
nocentium
nota
esse
oportet
et expedit ."
The repeating of a rumour which
is slanderous is not ,
however, justifiable
( 1) .
And falsely
and maliciously
to
slander
another man's title , by spreading
such injurious
reports ,
as , if true , would
deprive him of his
estate , or
tend to cut down the extent of title to it, is actionable ,
provided
any
special
damage
accrues
to the
proprietor
thereby ;
as if he loses an opportunity
of
selling
the
land (m).
Libel .
2ndly . A second way of affecting
a man's reputation
is 2ndly.
by the maliciously
publishing
of a printed
or written libel,
picture , sign , or the like ; which
sets
him in an odious,
contemptible , or ridiculous
light , and thereby diminishes
his reputation (n ) .
A libel , as we shall hereafter
see, is
indictable (0) ; it is also actionable , without proof of special
damage, and in an action
which
is to
compensate
the
plaintiff by pecuniary
damages for the wrong done him ,
the
defendant
may ,
as in an
action for words
spoken ,
justify by showing the truth of the facts which
he has
alleged and published .
The publication
of a libel may be
evidenced in various ways , as by reading it aloud , by sell-
ing it, or distributing
it gratis , or by sending it through

The
mode of
declaring in an

for defamation ,

been

by the
Common
Law Procedure Act , 1852 (a) , and by the stat.

material
improvements
with
regard
to it
have
been
effected , the
defendant
in
an
action
for slander
or libel, giving
notice in writing to
the plaintiff
at the
time of pleading
of his intention ,
may give in evidence , in mitigation
of damages
, that he
made or offered an apology before the commencement of
the action , or as soon afterwards as he had an opportunity ,
in case the action was commenced before (b) .
And in an
action for a libel in a public newspaper , or other periodical
publication , the defendant may plead that it was inserted
without
actual malice , and without gross negligence , and
that before the commencement of the action , or at the
earliest opportunity
afterwards , he inserted a full apology
for it ; or , if the newspaper or other periodical in which it
appeared should
be ordinarily
published
at intervals ex-
ceeding one
week , had offered
to publish
the apology in
any newspaper , &c. , to be selected
by the plaintiff : and
upon filing such plea , he may pay into
court a sum of
money by way of amends for the injury sustained by the
publication of the libel ( c) .

but
against
two persons at the least ;

for a false and malicious
prosecution (e).
The
essential
ground of which action
is, that
a legal
prosecution
was
carried
on without a probable
cause ; and this
must be
substantively and expressly proved , and cannot be implied .
From the want of probable cause , malice , indeed , may be ,
and
most commonly
is , implied ,
and the knowledge of
the defendant is also implied
; but from the most express
malice , the want of probable cause cannot be implied (ƒ) .
At the trial of this action , it is the duty of the judge
to
inform
the jury , if they find
the facts proved , and the
inferences to be warranted by such facts , that the same do
or do not amount to reasonable or probable cause , so that
the
question of fact is for the jury ,
and the
abstract
question of law is for the judge (g).
In such an action , moreover , it is essential to show that
the proceeding alleged to have been instituted
maliciously
and without
probable
cause , has terminated in favour
of
the plaintiff, if, from
its nature , it were capable of such
termination ( ).
But an action on the case for a malicious
prosecution may be founded upon an indictment , whereon
no acquittal can be had ;
as if it be rejected by the grand
jury, or be coram non judice , or be insufficiently
drawn .
For it is not the danger of the plaintiff, but the scandal ,
vexation , and expense caused , upon which
this
action is
founded .
II. We
are
next to consider the violation
of the right
of personal liberty.
This may be constituted ,

injury of false imprisonment , or 2, by that of malicious.

1. To constitute the injury of false imprisonment
there
are two points requisite ;
( 1. ) The detention of the person :

137
and (2. ) The unlawfulness of such detention .
Every con-
finement of the person is an imprisonment , whether it be
in a common
prison , or in
a private
house , or even by
forcibly detaining one in the public
streets ( ).
Unlawful ,
or false , imprisonment
consists
in such confinement
or
detention
without sufficient
authority : which
authority
may
arise either from some process from the courts of
justice , or from
some warrant from
a legal officer having
power to commit , under his hand and seal , and expressing
the
cause
of such commitment (k) ;
or from
some other
special
cause
justified , for
the
necessity of the thing,
either by common law , or act of parliament
; such as the
arresting
of a felon by a private
person without
warrant ,
or the impressing
of a mariner for the public
service (1).
False imprisonment
also may arise by executing
a lawful
warrant or process at an unlawful
time , as on a Sunday (m).
Such is the injury .
Let us next
consider the remedy for
it
which
is of one
or
other of two
sorts ;
the
one
removing
the injury , the
other
compelling
satisfaction
for it.
The means of removing
the actual injury of false im-
prisonment
known in very early times to our common law
were fourfold .
( 1) . By writ of mainprize .
(2) . By writ de
odio et atia .
( 3) . By writ de homine
replegiando.
(4) . By
writ of habeas corpus.
Of these writs , the three first men-
tioned are either abolished , or have become
obsolete , and
our remarks respecting them will therefore be very brief.
(1). The writ of mainprize (n) , manucaptio, though now (1). Writ of
disused , is often mentioned in the old reports , and may
be directed to the sheriff (either generally , when any man
is imprisoned
for a bailable
offence , and bail has been
refused ; or specially , when the
offence
or cause of com-
mitment
is
not
properly
bailable
below ) ,
commanding
him to take sureties for the prisoner's
appearance

called " mainpernors , "
and
to
set him
at
large (o).
Mainpernors
differ
from
bail , in
that
a man's bail may
imprison
or surrender him up before the stipulated day of
appearance ; mainpernors
can do neither , but are barely
sureties
for
his
appearance at
the
day ;
bail
are
only
sureties , that
the party
be
answerable for the
special
matter for which
they stipulate ; mainpernors
are bound
to produce him to answer all charges whatsoever (p) .
(2). The writ de odio et atiâ was anciently directed to the
sheriff , commanding
him to inquire
whether
a prisoner
charged with murder was committed
upon just
cause of
suspicion , or merely propter
odium et atiam, for
hatred
and
ill
-
will
;
and
if
upon the inquisition
due cause
of
suspicion did not appear
,
then
there issued another writ
for the sheriff
to
admit him
to
bail
.
This writ
,
according
to
Bracton
(q
),
was not
to
be denied
to
any man
(r).
(3).
The writ
de
homine
replegiando
(s)
lay
to
replevy
a
man out
of
prison
,
or
out
of
the custody
of
any private person
,
upon giving
security
to
the sheriff that the man should be
forthcoming
to
answer any charge against him
.
And
if
the person were conveyed
out
of
the sheriff's
jurisdiction
,
the sheriff might have returned
that he
was
eloigned
,
elongatus
:
upon which
a
process
issued
(
called
a
capias
in
withernam
)
to
imprison
the
defendant
himself
,
without
bail
or
mainprize
,
till
he
should
produce the party
.
This
writ
,
however
,
was guarded
by
so
many
exceptions

that it
was

many
cases ,
especially where the crown was concerned.
The incapacity
therefore of these three remedies

them ; and

a

made use of by the courts at Westminster
, for removing
prisoners from
one
court into
another for the more
easy
administration
of justice .
Such is the
habeas corpus ad
respondendum
, now unnecessary , but which was formerly
used when a man had
a cause
of action against one who
was
confined by the process of some
inferior
court , in
order to remove the prisoner , and charge him with the
new action in the
court
above .
Such is that
ad satis-
faciendum , when
a prisoner
has had judgment against
him in an action , and the plaintiff is desirous to bring
him up to some superior court
to charge him in
execu-
tion (u) .
Such
also
are
those
ad
prosequendum
, testifi-
candum, deliberandum , &c. (x) ;
which
issue
when it is
necessary to remove
a prisoner , in order to prosecute , or
bear testimony in any court , or to be tried in the proper
jurisdiction
.
Such also
is the writ ad faciendum

cipiendum , which issued out of one of the courts at West-

minster , when a person , sued in some inferior jurisdiction
,
was desirous to remove the action into the superior court ;
it commanded the inferior
judge
to produce the body of
the
defendant , together with the day and
cause
of his
caption
and detainer (whence the writ was frequently de-
nominated
a habeas corpus cum causa) to do and receive
whatsoever the court should consider in that behalf .
The
writ in question
was available
to bring up
a defendant
who was actually
or constructively
in the custody of an
inferior
court ; and inasmuch
as by the stat.
1 & 2 Vict .
c. 110 , a defendant can no longer be held to bail in such
a court , the writ of habeas corpus cum causâ can in general
be no longer used (y) .
But the
great
and efficacious writ , in all
manner of
illegal
confinement , is that of habeas
corpus ad
sub-
jiciendum ; directed
to the person detaining
another , and
commanding
him
to produce the body of the
prisoner ,
with the day and cause
of his
caption and detention , ad
faciendum , subjiciendum
, et recipiendum , to do , submit
to ,
and receive
whatsoever the judge
or court awarding
such
writ shall
consider in that behalf .
This is a high pre-
rogative writ , and therefore at common law issuing out of
the court of queen's bench not only in term time , but also
during the vacation (≈) , and running into most parts of the
queen's dominions : for the queen is at all times entitled
to have an account , why the liberty of any of her subjects
is restrained , wheresoever that restraint
may be inflicted .
Formerly, indeed , if the
party
were
privileged
in
the
court of common
pleas or exchequer , as being
(or sup-
posed to be) an officer or suitor of the
court ,
a habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum might also by common law have
been awarded from
thence (a) ; and, if the
cause of im-
prisonment
were palpably illegal, such court might have
discharged him (b) : but , if he were
committed

criminal
matter , they could only have remanded him, or
taken bail for
his
appearance in the queen's bench (c) ,
which occasioned
the common pleas for some time to dis-
countenance such applications .
But since the mention of
the queen's bench and common pleas , as
co-ordinate in
this jurisdiction
, by statute 16 Car .
1 , c. 10 , every subject
of the kingdom
has been held
to be equally entitled
to
the
benefit of the common law writ , in either of those
courts , at his
option ; and it may now issue out of the
court of exchequer , under the 56 Geo . 3 , c. 100 , s . 2 (d).
It is necessary to apply for a habeas
corpus by motion
to the court ,
as in the
case of other
prerogative
writs
which do not issue as of mere
course , without
showing
some
probable
cause why the extraordinary
power of the
crown is called in to the party's
assistance
.
For , as was
argued by lord
chief justice
Vaughan
(e) , " it is granted
on motion , because it cannot be had of course ; and there
is therefore no necessity to grant it ; for the court ought
to be satisfied that the party hath
a probable cause
to be
delivered ."
And this seems
the more reasonable because
(when
once
granted ) the person to whom it is directed.
must , at the risk of an attachment
being
issued against
him, bring up the body of the
prisoner , or show that he
is unable to do so .
So that if the writ issued of mere
course, without
showing to the court or judge
some rea-
sonable ground
for awarding
it, a traitor
or felon under
sentence
of death ,
a soldier
or
seaman
in the queen's
service ,
or
one
committed
for contempt
or confined for
insanity , might obtain a temporary enlargement by suing
out a habeas
corpus , though
sure to be remanded when
brought up to the court .

there
appearing ,

his
own
showing ,
sufficient
grounds
to
confine
him (f).
On the
other
hand , if a probable
ground
be
shown , that the party
is
imprisoned
without
just
cause (g), and therefore
has
a
right to be delivered , the writ of habeas corpus is then
a
writ of right, which " may not be denied, but ought to be
granted to every man that is committed , or detained
in
prison , or otherwise restrained , though it be by the com-
mand of the king , the privy council , or any other (h) . ”
In a former
part of these Commentaries
(2) we expa-
tiated
at large
on the personal
liberty
of the
subject .
This
was shown
to be a natural
inherent
right, which
could not be surrendered
or forfeited , unless by the com-
mission of some offence
against
society , and which ought
not to be abridged in any case without the special permis-
sion of law.
A doctrine
coeval with the first rudiments
of the English constitution , and handed down to us from
our Saxon
ancestors , notwithstanding
all their struggles
with the Danes , and the violence of the Norman conquest :
asserted
afterwards
and
confirmed
by
the
conqueror
himself and his descendants ; and though sometimes im-
paired by the ferocity of the times , and
the
occasional
despotism of jealous or usurping
princes , yet established
on the firmest
basis
by the provisions
of Magna
Carta ,
and
a succession of statutes
affirming
them .
To assert
an absolute
exemption
from imprisonment
in all
cases ,
would be inconsistent with every idea of law and political
society ; and in the end would
destroy all civil liberty , by
rendering
its protection
impossible
: but the glory of the
English law consists
in
clearly
defining
the
times , the
causes , and
the
extent ,
when ,
wherefore , and to
what
degree
the imprisonment
of the subject may be lawful .
This it is, which induces the absolute necessity of express-
ing upon
every commitment
the
reason for which it is
made : so that the court upon a habeas corpus may examine

into its validity ;
and,
according
to
the
circumstances
of the case , may discharge , admit
to bail, or remand the
prisoner .
And yet , early in the reign
of Charles
I. the
court
of king's bench , professing to rely on some arbitrary pre-
cedents , declared that they could not upon a habeas corpus
either bail or deliver a prisoner , though committed without
any
cause assigned , in
case
he was
committed
by the
special command of the king , or by the lords of the privy
council
(k) .
But
the petition
of right, 3 Car .
1 , c.
1 ,
which recites this illegal judgment , enacts that no freeman
shall thenceforth
be so imprisoned
or detained .
When ,
in the following year , Mr. Selden and others were com-
mitted by the lords of the council , in pursuance of the
king's
special
command
under
a
general
charge
of
" notable contempts
and stirring up sedition
against the
king and government ," the judges
delayed for two terms
(including
also the long

Nicholas
Hyde , at the same time declaring ( ), that if the
prisoner

remanded for that

the court would
not

grant
a habeas
corpus,
being already made acquainted with the cause of the im-
prisonment .

heard
with indignation

astonishment
by every lawyer present ; according

JURISDICTION
OF
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
These pitiful evasions gave rise to the statute 16 Car . 1 ,
c. 10 , enacting (s . 8) , that if any person be committed by
the sovereign in person , or by his privy council , or by any
of the members thereof, he shall have granted unto him,
without
delay upon
any pretence whatsoever , a writ of
habeas
corpus, upon which the legality of such commit-
ment
shall
be examined , and justice
shall be
done
by
delivering , bailing , or
remanding
such
prisoner .
Yet
still in the case of Jenkes , who in 1676 was committed by
the king in council , for
a turbulent
speech
made by him
on the hustings
at Guildhall (0) , new shifts
and devices
were made use of to prevent his
enlargement by law, the
chiefjustice
(as well as the chancellor ) declining
to award
a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum
in vacation , though
at last he
thought
proper
to
allow
process
to
issue,
whereby the prisoner was discharged .
Other abuses
had
also crept
into
daily
practice ,
which in
some
measure
defeated the benefit of this great constitutional
remedy.
The party imprisoning
was at liberty
to delay his obedi-
ence to the first writ , and might wait till a second
and a
third , called an alias and
a pluries , were issued , before he
produced
the
party ;
and
other
vexatious
shifts
were
practised to detain state prisoners in custody.
To repress
these was passed the Habeas Corpus Act , 31 Car . 2 , c. 2 ,
intituled " An Act for the
better securing
the liberty of
the subject, and for prevention of imprisonments
beyond
the seas ."
This statute enacts,
1. That on complaint
and request
in writing by or on behalf of any person committed
and
charged with any crime (unless committed
for treason or
felony
expressed
in the warrant
; or as
accessory
, or on
suspicion of being accessory , before the fact , to any felony ,
or upon suspicion of such felony , plainly expressed
in the
warrant ; or unless he is convicted or charged in execution.

judges ; and
upon

That such writ shall be indorsed , as granted in pursu-
ance of this
act , and signed by the person awarding
it.
3. That the writ shall be returned and the prisoner brought
up , within a limited
time according
to the distance , not
exceeding in any case
twenty days.
4. That officers
and
keepers neglecting
to make due returns , or not delivering
to the prisoner or his agent within six hours after demand
a copy of the
warrant

or shifting the
custody of a prisoner

cient reason or authority (specified
in the act) , shall for the

5. That no person once delivered by habeas corpus shall be
recommitted

offence ,
on
penalty
of 5007 .
6. That every person committed for treason or felony shall ,
if he requires it the first week of the next term , or the
first day of the
next
session
of
oyer
and terminer , be
indicted in that term or session , or else admitted to bail :
unless the witnesses for the crown
cannot be produced at
that time : and if acquitted , or if not indicted
and tried
in the second term ,
or
session ,
he shall be discharged
from
his imprisonment
for
such
imputed
offence
:
but
that no person, after the assizes shall have opened
for the
county in which
he is detained , shall be removed by habeas
corpus, till
after
they are
ended ; but

bench or common pleas ; and the lord chancellor or judges

8. That this writ of habeas corpus shall
run

the
counties palatine , cinque ports , and other
privileged
places , and the islands
of Jersey and Guern-
sey (p).
9. That no inhabitant
of
England
(except
a
person
contracting , or
a
convict
praying , to be trans-
ported ; or having
committed
some capital
offence
in the
place to which he is sent) shall
be sent prisoner
to Scot-
land , or any place beyond the seas , within or without
the
dominions of the crown ; on pain that the party commit-
ting, his advisers , aiders , and assistants , shall forfeit to the
party
aggrieved
a sum of

recovered
with
treble costs ; shall be disabled
to bear any office of trust
or profit ;
shall
incur the
penalties
of præmunire ;
and
shall be incapable of receiving pardon from the crown .
Such
is the
substance of this
great
and
important
statute
which extends (we may observe) only to the case
of a commitment for a criminal
charge such that no incon-
venience can be caused
to public justice
by a temporary
enlargement
of the prisoner :
other
cases of unjust
im-
prisonment
having formerly been left to the habeas corpus
at common law.
Now, however , a person confined " other-
wise than for some criminal
or supposed
criminal
matter ,"
except he be imprisoned
for debt , or by process
in any civil
suit , may avail himself of the statute 56 Geo . 3 , c. 100 ,
intituled , " An Act for more effectually securing the liberty
of the subject ," and providing
as under ( 9) :—
That
a judge of any of the
superior law courts , if it
shall appear by affidavit
or affirmation

That wilful disobedience of the writ shall
be

a contempt

his refusal to give
security , may commit
him to prison .

the writ

By the
admirable
regulations
above
set
forth ,
the
remedy for removing
the injury of unjust and illegal im-
prisonment may now be regarded as complete , and besides
the efficacy of the writ of habeas corpus in liberating
the
subject from illegal confinement in a public prison , it also
extends its influence
to remove every unjust
restraint
of personal freedom in private life , though
imposed by a
husband
on his wife , or by a father
on his child ;
but
when
a feme covert or an infant is brought
before the
court by habeas corpus , the court will only set such person
free from an unmerited
or unreasonable confinement , and
will not determine the validity
of a marriage , or the right
to the guardianship
of an
infant .
Though if a child

of its own , the

Injuries

from time to time , be found indicated , rendering justifiable
the restraint of a man's person otherwise than in virtue of
process, criminal
or civil , or in pursuance of statutory
provisions .
Thus a private person may lawfully interpose
to put a stop to a breach of the peace , and may arrest any
of the
queen's
subjects who are engaged in it (t) .
So
where
a felony has been committed , a person
suspected
on reasonable and probable
cause of having committed it
may lawfully be arrested and imprisoned , in order that a
criminal
charge may be preferred against him ; and if such
charge prove
groundless , and
an
action
be
afterwards
brought
at suit of the party charged against the person
who
caused
him to be apprehended , the issue may sub-
stantially
be of this kind- had the defendant reasonable
and probable
cause for giving the plaintiff into
custody
as the offender ?
Should it appear that he did so without
availing
himself of a ready and obvious
mode of ascer-
taining
the truth, the absence of inquiry by the defendant
will be an element in determining
as to the existence of
reasonable and probable cause for the arrest (u).
2. The action for a malicious arrest is a remedy available
where legal process
has maliciously , and without
reason-
able or probable cause , been put in force (x).
To support
this
action , it must be shown that the former
suit
or
proceeding was determined
in the plaintiff's
favour ( y) .

open violence : though
the law in both
cases
supposes
force and constraint , the wife having no power to consent ;
and therefore gives
a remedy by action of trespass (a) ;
and the husband is also entitled
to recover damages in an
action on the case against such as persuade and entice the
wife to live separate
from him without
a sufficient

The old law was so strict in this point, that if one's wife
missed her way upon the road , it was not lawful for another
man to take her into his house, unless
she was benighted
and in danger of being lost or drowned ( ) : but a stranger
might carry her behind him on horseback to market , to a

And further , that " every such action

ian and
ward.
IV. Master
and servant.
III. Injuries to the relation
of guardian
and ward
are
usually redressed in equity (r) , though in strictness
an
action
(formerly
not uncommon ) would still be maintain-
able at suit of a guardian
for taking away his ward (s) ; it
will lie also for her seduction if he be in loco parentis (t).
IV. To the relation
between master
and servant , and
the rights
accruing therefrom , there are two species
of in-
juries incident .
The
one
is ,
retaining
a
man's
hired
servant
before his
time is expired ; the other is beating
him , causing him personal hurt , or confining
him so that
he is not able to perform his work .
As to the first , the
retaining
another person's servant during the time he has
agreed to serve his present master ; this , as it is an ungen-
tlemanlike , so it is also an illegal act. For every master has
by his contract purchased for a valuable
consideration the
service of his domestics for a limited
time : the inveigling
or hiring his servant , which induces a breach of this con-
tract , whether done maliciously
or with notice after exist-
ence of the relation , is therefore an injury to the master ;
and for that injury the law has given
him a remedy by
action (u) ; and the master may also have an action against
the servant
for the
non -performance
of his
agreement.
The
other injury
is that of beating , confining , or dis-
abling
a man's
servant , which
depends upon
the
same
principle as the last ; viz . , the property which the master
has by his contract acquired in the labour of the servant .
In this
case , besides the
remedy by action for battery ,
bodily hurt, or imprisonment
, which the servant himself,
as
an individual
, may have
against
the
aggressor , the
master
also, to compel a recompence for his immediate

loss , may maintain
an action , in which he must allege and
prove the special damage he has sustained by the beating
of his servant , per quod servitium amisit (x) ; and in which
the jury will make him a proportionable
pecuniary satisfac-
tion . If, however , bodily hurt
were
caused
to the servant
by the defendant , whilst performing
his contract with the
servant , ex gr., as
a carrier
of passengers
for hire, and
there be no privity between the defendant and the master ,
an action at suit of the latter will not lie (y).
:
We may observe that in these relative injuries , notice is
only taken of the wrong done to the superior
of the par-
ties related , by the breach
and dissolution
of either the
relation
itself, or at least the
advantage accruing
there-
from
while the
loss of the inferior by such injuries is ,
except where the death of a parent
has been
caused by
negligence (*) , unregarded .
One reason for which
may
be, that the inferior has no kind of property in the com-
pany , care , or assistance of the
superior , as the superior
is held to have in that of the inferior
; and therefore the
inferior
can, in
contemplation
of law,
suffer
no loss.

The wife cannot

beating of her

The

has
no property

guardian .
And the servant , whose
master
is
disabled ,
does not thereby lose his maintenance or wages .
He had
no property in his master ; and if he receives
his part of
the stipulated contract he suffers no injury, and is there-
fore entitled to no action , for any battery or imprisonment
which such master may happen to endure .

BREACHES
OF
CONTRACT .
In the
preceding
chapter we considered wrongs which
affect the rights of persons, viewed
either
as individuals
,
or as related to each other ; and are now to enter upon the
discussion
of such
wrongs
and
breaches
of contract
as
directly or indirectly affect the rights of property , together
with the remedies which the law has given
to repair or
redress them .
We shall first
enquire
respecting
breaches
of contract
unauthenticated
by deed
;
of bonds
and
covenants
we
have treated in our preceding volume .
A simple contract may be defined to be " an agreement
or undertaking
upon
consideration , to do or not to do a
particular thing." From which definition there arise three
points to be contemplated in every contract ;
1st .
The
agreement
or
undertaking
;
2ndly.
The
consideration
;
and 3rdly . The thing to be done or not to be done.
First , then , a contract is an agreement , a mutual
bar-
gain or convention
; and to constitute it there must
be at
least two parties consenting and competent to contract : as.
where A. contracts with B. on some sufficient
considera-
tion ,
as to which we shall
presently enquire , to pay him
100 %. , and thereby transfers a property in such sum
to B.
Which property is however not in possession, but in action
merely , and recoverable by suit at law.
Parties
are perfectly free to contract
in
any way that
the law does
not forbid ; this right to
contract
being
essential for the
trading
classes,
and
indeed for
every

member of the
community .
A contract
may
be
either
express or implied .
An express contract is where the terms of the agreement Express ;
are, at the time of making it, openly uttered and avowed ,
as
to deliver
an ox , or ten loads of timber , or to pay a
stated price for certain goods .
An implied
contract is one which reason and justice dic-
Implied.
tate , and which
therefore
the law presumes that every
man undertakes to perform .
Thus , if I employ a person
to transact any business for me, or perform any work , the
law implies that I undertook
or assumed to pay him so
much as his labour deserved
.
And if I neglect to make
him amends , he has a remedy for this injury by bringing
his action on the case upon such implied
promise , under-
taking , or assumpsit ; wherein
he is at liberty to suggest
that I promised
to pay him so much as he reasonably de-
served, and then to aver that his trouble was really worth
such a particular
sum, which the defendant has omitted to
pay.
But this valuation
of his trouble
is
submitted
to
the determination of a jury ; who will
assess
such a sum
in damages
as they think he really merited .
This is in
technical
language ,
called
an assumpsit
on
a
quantum
meruit.
So , if I take up wares from a tradesman , without
any agreement of price , the law concludes that I con-
tracted to pay their real value , and there is an implied as-
sumpsit on a quantum valebat , which
is very similar to the
former .
The law concludes , that both parties
did
inten-
tionally agree , that the real value of the goods should be
paid ; and an action may be brought
accordingly , if the
vendee
refuses to pay such value .
Another
species
of implied
assumpsit is when one has
received money belonging
to another , without
any valu-
able consideration
given
on the receiver's part : for the
law construes this to be money received for the use of the
owner only ; and implies that the person so receiving pro-
mised and undertook
to account for it to the true pro-
prietor .
And if he unjustly detains it, an action
lies


156

COURTS
OF

against him for the breach of such implied promise and un-
dertaking
; and he will be made to recompense the owner
in damages, for what he has detained in violation of hist
promise .
This is a very extensive and beneficial remedy ,
applicable
in
many
cases
where
the
defendant
has re-
ceived
money which ex æquo et bono he ought to refund .
It lies for money paid by mistake
or on a consideration.
which has failed , or through
imposition , extortion
or op-
pression , or where any undue advantage has been taken of
the plaintiff's situation .
So where a person has laid
out and expended his own
money for the use of another , at his request, the law im-
plies
a promise
of repayment , and an action will lie on
this assumpsit ; and upon
a stated account between two
merchants ,
or
other
persons , the law implies
that
he
against whom the balance appears has engaged to pay it
to the other ; though there be not any actual promise .
A contract
then
may be set forth in words
spoken
or
written , or may be raised and inferred from what has been
said, or from surrounding
circumstances and the conduct of
the parties . Of either sort of contract , express
or implied ,
a court of law will take cognisance , and will award pecu-
niary compensation for its
breach .
A court , however ,
must often be guided
by considerations
in regard
to the
one of them , different
from
those which guide
or influ-
ence it in regard to the other .
An express
contract , when
conceived in terms
definite
and unambiguous , indicates
the reciprocal rights
and duties of the parties to it.
And
here the function of the court is auxiliary
to carrying into
effect , so far
as its machinery may allow , their will .
It
sometimes happens , however , that the wording
of an ex-
press
contract
is
obscure
and
doubtful ,
and
then the
duty
of
interpreting
it
devolves
upon
the
court ,
and
certain
rules of construction
have to
be
called in
aid
for determining
its
significance .
The leading canons of
interpretation
may be thus expounded .
The
construction
must be ascertained on a view and careful examination

be

possible ,

so
that
every
word
used in it
may
take

The
duty
of the
court being to ascertain not what the contracting
parties
may be supposed
to have
intended , but the meaning of
the words which they have used
; and these words
should
be construed according to their ordinary and grammatical
sense, unless some obvious absurdity , or some repugnance ,
or inconsistency with the intention
appearing on the whole
instrument ,
would
follow from such
construction - the
words used will then , if possible , be modified to avoid the
consequences hinted
at, but no further (a) .
Evidence
of
usage
and custom
is , moreover , admissible , to
explain
a
mercantile
contract , provided such evidence does not go to
contravene or vary it.

tract , we are , secondly , to proceed
to the consideration upon tion .
which it is founded ; or the reason which
moves the con-
tracting
party to enter into the contract .
A contract is
an agreement , " upon consideration ."
The benefit which
accrues
to the promisor , or the inconvenience or detriment
suffered by the promisee , is called the consideration for the
promise
and it must be a thing lawful in itself , or else
the
contract
is voidable .
A good

which ,
as we have before
seen (b) , is that

or
natural affection between near relations , will not support
an assumpsit.
But a contract may rest upon any valuable
consideration , as money, or work done , for the person con-
tracted with has then given an equivalent in recompense ,
for the undertaking
by the other party .
Valuable considerations
are divided
by the civilians (c)
into four
species
:
1. Do , ut des : as when I give money
or goods , on
a contract
that I shall
be repaid money or
goods for them again . Of this kind are all loans of money
upon
bond , or promise of re-payment ; and all
sales
of
goods, in which
either there is an express
contract to pay
so much for them , or else the law implies a contract to pay
so much
as they
are worth .
2.
The
second
species
is ,
facio, ut facias :
as , when I agree with a man to do his
work for him , if he will do mine for me ; or if two persons
agree to marry together ; or to do any other positive
acts
on both
sides:
Or, it may be to forbear
on
one
side in
consideration of something done on the other ;
as , that in
consideration A, the tenant , will repair his house, B , the
landlord , will
not sue him for waste.
Or, it may be for
mutual
forbearance on both sides
;
as , that in considera-
tion that A will not trade
to Lisbon , B will not trade to
Marseilles
;
so
as
to avoid interfering
with
each
other .
3.
The
third
species
of consideration
is facio, ut des :
when
a man
agrees
to perform
any thing for
a price ,
either
specifically mentioned , or left
to the determination
of the law to set a value to it.
And when a servant hires
himself to his master for certain wages or an agreed sum
of money
here the servant contracts to do his master's
service , in order to earn that specific sum .
Otherwise , if
he be hired generally ;
for then he is under an implied
contract to perform the service for what it shall be reason-
ably worth .
4. The fourth species
is , do , ut facias : which
is the direct
counterpart
of the preceding .
As when I
agree with a servant to give him such wages, upon his

performing
such work : which , we see , is nothing
else but
the last species inverted ; for servus facit , ut herus det , and
herus dat, ut servus faciat .
:
The nature of a consideration will be abundantly
exem-
plified in the ensuing pages , and we shall here merely add
that a consideration of some sort or other is so necessary
to the forming
of a contract , that
a nudum pactum , or
agreement to do or pay something
on one side , without
any compensation on the other , will not at law support an
action
and a man cannot be compelled to perform it .
As
if one man promises to give another
100 %. , here there is
nothing
contracted
for or given
on the
one
side , and
therefore
there is nothing
binding
on the other .
And ,
however a man may or may not be bound to perform
his
promise , in honour
or
conscience
, which
the
municipal
laws
do not take upon them to
decide
;
certainly
those
municipal
laws will
not
compel
the
execution
of that

he had no visible
inducement to
engage for : for
our law has adopted the maxim
of the civil law that

thing to be
3rdly . We are next to consider
the thing agreed
to be ardly . The
done or not to be done. A contract is an agreement , upon done or not
consideration , " to do or not to do a particular
thing ."
We must here consequently enquire concerning specific
kinds of contracts , and shall divide them into three classes .
I.
Contracts
which
are required
to be in writing by the
statute law. II. Contracts which , by mercantile custom ,
are in writing. III. Other contracts .
required to
by statute.
I. Within the first of the
above
three
classes
(regard I. Contracts

included
the
contract
of

agreements

OF LAW.
1. Contract
of sale.
1.
Sale is
a transfer
of property
from
one
man
to
another , in consideration of some
price or recompense in
value
for there is no sale without
a recompense ; there
must be quid pro quo (ƒ) .
A commutation
of goods for
goods ,
is
properly
an
exchange ; but a transferring
of
goods for money , is
called
a sale : which is a method of
exchange
introduced
for
the
convenience
of mankind ,
money having
been
established
as
a universal
medium ,
which
may be exchanged for all sorts of other property ;
whereas if goods were only to be exchanged for goods , by
way of barter , it would
be difficult to adjust
the respec-
tive values , and the carriage would be intolerably cumber-
some.
All civilized
nations adopted therefore very early
the use of money ; for we find Abraham giving " four
hundred
shekels of silver , current
money with the mer-
chant ," for the field of Machpelah
( g) : though
the prac-
tice of exchange is still found to subsist among
savage
tribes . We shall not further advert to it, as such a trans-
action rarely
comes
under judicial notice (h).
A sale differs from a gift , inasmuch
as there is a con-
sideration for the former , and none for the latter.
And
hence the gift of a chattel , if valid, must either be authen-
ticated by deed , or be accompanied with delivery of pos-
session ( ) ; as if A gives to B
1007. , or a flock of sheep ,
and puts him in possession of them directly , it is then a
gift
executed in the donee
; and it is not in the donor's
power to retract it, though he did it without
any conside-
ration or recompense : unless it be prejudicial to creditors ;
or the donor were under
some legal
incapacity , as infancy
or coverture ; or if he were drawn
in , circumvented ,
or
imposed upon , by false pretences
, ebriety , or surprise .
If A and B mutually
treat for the sale and purchase of
goods which
are in
esse , then , generally
speaking , their
contract
will
be
complete
when
its
terms

definite , and have been
assented to on both
sides . If the vendor
If the vendor
says , the price
of certain
goods is four pounds , and the vendee
says , he
will give four pounds , the bargain
is struck ; and neither
of the parties is at liberty to be off, the obligation
im-
posed upon the vendor being to deliver
the
goods upon
payment of the price , and that imposed on the purchaser
being
to pay the
price
agreed
upon ,
and
receive
the
goods (j) ; and in the case put , the property in the goods ,
if defined and appropriated
(k) , passes
by the bargain and
sale to the
vendee .
According
to the law of England ,
" by a contract for the sale of specific ascertained goods ,
the property immediately
vests in the buyer , and
a right
to the price in the seller , unless it can be shown that such
was not the intention of the parties " (D).
Where, indeed , parties have, by their words or conduct ,
sufficiently indicated their intention
as to the mode of car-
rying out the stipulations of their contract , a court of law ,
if called on, will endeavour to give operation and effect to
such intention . If there be a sale of goods which
are to
be sent by a carrier to the purchaser , and the goods perish or
sustain damage whilst in transitu , the ordinary rule of our
law would , in the absence of special circumstances , apply .
Delivery to the
carrier is delivery to the consignee , who
will therefore have to bear the loss .
But if the parties
intend that the vendor shall not merely deliver the goods
to the carrier , but undertake that they shall
actually
be
delivered at their destination , and
express
such intention ,
effect will be given to this arrangement ; and in such a
case , if the goods
perish in the hands of the carrier , the
vendor is not only not entitled
to the price , but he is liable
for whatever damage may have been sustained by the pur-
chaser , in consequence
of the breach of his (the vendor's )

Or, again ,
the parties
may intend that the vendor
shall deliver
the
goods , which
are the subject-matter of their
contract , to
the carrier , and that , when he has done so , he shall
have
fulfilled his undertaking , so that he shall not be liable in

for a breach of contract if the goods do not reach.
their destination ;
and yet the contracting
parties
may
intend that the whole
or part of the price
shall
not be
payable
unless
the goods
arrive .
The
parties may bar-
gain and agree that the property in the goods shall vest in
the purchaser as
soon
as the goods are
shipped , and yet
that the price in whole or in part shall be payable only on
the contingency
of the goods arriving
;
and to
such
an
arrangement , if the intention of the parties be expressed
,
the court will give effect
; if the intention
be not expressed
in terms , the court will endeavour to ascertain it from the
various
stipulations in the contract (m ).
If, again , there
be a usage or custom of trade shown to exist affecting the
subject-matter of the contract , such usage or custom , if
not inconsistent
with, will be imported into the
contract ,
and
so will become
a term or item of agreement between
the contracting parties , who will be presumed to have meant
to incorporate
the mercantile
usage or local
custom with
their contract (n).
The transfer of property may take place either upon or
after delivery (0).
For instance , where anything
remains
to be done by the seller of the goods which are the subject-
matter
of the
contract , for the
purpose
of ascertaining
their price , as by weighing , measuring , or testing
them ,
the price having been made dependent on the quantity or
quality of the goods , the performance of such thing is
a
condition precedent to the transfer of the property in the
goods , even though
they be ascertained
and
are

state in which
they
ought
to
be
accepted .
But this
general rule may be modified by the expressed
intention
of the parties (p).
Where a contract is made for the purchase
and sale of
goods not ascertained ,
the
property
therein
cannot
of
course pass immediately
to the
vendor ,
but it is quite
competent
to the
vendor
and
vendee to
make
what-
soever
bargain
they
please,
so
as
to
regulate
the
vesting of the property in the goods
when they have
become
ascertained
and
specific ,
and
the
courts will
endeavour to search out and give
effect to such their in-
tention . If goods are ordered
from abroad under a con-
tract, showing the intention
of the parties to be that the
goods
shall
be shipped by the
person who is to supply
them , on the terms
that when
shipped they shall be the
consignee's property , and at his risk , so that the vendor
shall
be paid for them whether
delivered at the port of
destination
or not , this intention
is effectual.
Such is
a
very common state of things , and the obligations
thence
resulting
are of this kind :-The vendor's
duty is in such
case
at an end, when he has delivered the goods to the
carrier , and if the goods perish in the carrier's hands , the
maxim res perit domino applies ; the vendor is discharged ,
and the purchaser is bound to pay to him the price of the
goods or merchandize (q) .

As closely
connected
with this part of our subject ,
a stoppage in
peculiar
doctrine
of the law demands attention .
Where
an unpaid vendor of goods
has put them into the hands of
a carrier in order to their being by him conveyed
and de-
livered
to the vendee
; then , if the vendee
before actual
delivery to him becomes
bankrupt
or insolvent , the vendor
has a right , if he can , to resume possession of the goods ,
by stopping them in transitu (r) , but his right to do so will

be defeated if the consignee of the goods assign over the
bill of lading to one who bonâ fide purchases them ."
The assignment of a bill of lading is in practice fre-
quent , and so the vendor's right to stop in transitu is often
set at naught .
Thus , a merchant resident in this country ,
has merchandize
consigned
to him from abroad ; he re-
ceives
advice that
there is
a large quantity of the
same
article ready for shipment to our market ; he knows that
when these projected consignments arrive the home market
will be glutted , and the goods in question
depreciated in
value .
He wishes , therefore , to sell his own cargo imme-
diately , whilst it is at sea , and before it comes
to hand ,
and the
profit
thus
derivable would
be fairly gained ;
accordingly
he desires to negociate the bill of lading , and
he would of course be precluded from doing
so unless he
could
thereby
legally defeat the right of his
consignor
to stop in transitu .
A quick circulation
is the life and
soul of trade, and if the merchant cannot sell with safety
to the buyer , that quickness of circulation
must
neces-
sarily be retarded (s) .
The right of stoppage in transitu
exists then , in the event mentioned , where goods have been
sold and constructively
delivered ; delivery to the carrier ,
whether by land or water , being in law a delivery to the
true
nature ,
obscurity
prevails .
Sometimes this right of the vendor
to stop in transitu has been viewed
as an equitable lien upon the goods ;
sometimes
regarded
as a privilege
resulting
from
his latent
jus pro-
prietatis ; or as a power impliedly
reserved to him to rescind
the con-
tract of sale under
certain circum-
stances ; or as an arbitrary
doctrine
adopted
for the
benefit
of trade .
According
to the
opinion
of Lord
Abinger, in Gibson v. Carruthers , 8
M.
& W.
339, the right of stop-
page in transitu may be presumed
to
be
a part of the law of mer-
chants , which prevails
generally
on
the continent , the proof of which,
from
time to time , by competent
evidence ,
combined with its mani-
fest
justice
and utility , at length
introduced
it into
the
common
law of England , of which the law
merchant , properly
understood , has
always
been
reckoned
to
form
a
part .

vendee (t), and our law regarding
the contract of sale as
ambulatory and permitting
the unpaid vendor at any time
before the arrival of the goods at their place of destination ,
at any time , indeed , before they have got
into
the pur-
chaser's hands , or the bill of lading has been assigned , to
resume possession of the goods , and thus to put himself
in the same
position
as if he had not parted with them .
But the right of stoppage in transitu cannot be exercised
when the transit
is terminated (u).
Such being the contract of sale and its effect in passing
property
at
common
law,
certain
statutory
provisions
concerning it
must
be
noticed .
Our

law
recognised
no distinction

When , however , writing had become common , and trading

it ex-

proof in writing of an

BREACHES

The general effect of the 17th section of the Statute of
Frauds is clear ; it nullifies
a contract not authenticated in
conformity with
its
requirements
(e).
Serious difficulties
have
,
however
,
arisen
in
construing
it
,
and embarrassment
has been felt
in
regard
to
the sufficiency
of
the memo-
randum
(ƒ
)
and
of
the signature
(g)
which will satisfy
it;
perhaps from
amongst
such minor
difficulties
,
the most
noteworthy
points decided are that
a
proposal
in
writing
signed by the party
to
be charged
and
accepted
verbally
by the party
to
whom
it
is
made will suffice
(h
),
and that
where
a
bought
and
a
sold note
,
delivered
respectively
to
the
buyer and seller
of
goods by the
broker
who
negociates their sale
,
are
relied upon
as
evidencing the
contract
,
a
material
variance
between
such
notes will
preclude them from
so
doing
().
Where
an offer
to
sell
goods
is
made
,
the
bargain
is
complete
when
a
letter
accepting
such offer without
qualification
is
put into the
post
(j
).
The principal
difficulty
,
however
,
experienced
in
con-
struing the 17th
section
of
the
Statute
of
Frauds
has
arisen on that clause
of
it
which
provides
as
a
substitute
for
a
written
memorandum
of
the sale of goods
an
"
acceptance
and
actual
receipt
"
thereof
.
It
will
be
conceded
that the word
"
accept
"
is
stronger
than
the
words
"
actually receive
,"
which must be taken
to
signify
a
receipt

Effect of
illegality or
fraud.
And in most
cases
the question whether
or not the 17th
section of the
Statute of Frauds
has been complied with
will be one of fact, and it will be for the jury to say what
was the character of the transaction , whether
or no the
circumstances
deposed
to show that there was an accep-
tance and actual receipt of the goods in question (k) ; the
larger the bulk of the goods as to which
a question under
the statute
arises, the
more
impracticable
would
be
a
manual receipt of them .
Again, if goods sent on approval
are retained by the
consignee for an unreasonable time , or if acts of ownership
are
exercised by him over the goods , an acceptance
may
be inferred
or presumed
as
against
the
alleged
vendee
when sued for the value of the goods.
If the purchaser
of goods by sample re-sells them before objecting
to the
quality of the goods , he will afterwards be precluded from
saying that he has not accepted them within the statute ,
for he has exercised an indubitable
act of ownership over
the
goods by re-selling
them (7).
And
there
may be
an acceptance
and receipt such
as to satisfy the statute ,
and yet the buyer may refuse to carry out the contract on
the ground
that the goods were not according
to it (m).
Acts , indeed, done at different periods of time may be so
connected together as to form
one
transaction , and there-
fore it would seem that an acceptance
of goods within the
statute may be prior to the actual delivery of them (»).
It was long since judicially
observed
that the
law is
best applied
when made subservient to the honesty of a
case , and that our law merchant
is a system of equity
founded
on the
rules of equity
and governed in all its
parts by plain justice and good faith (0).

forcibly
applies in regard to the contract of sale , which
cannot
be allowed
to
stand if tainted
by illegality
or
fraud .
Not only is a contract
made in direct contravention
of Illegality .
the statute law null and of no
effect , but if two parties.
enter into an agreement whereby it is stipulated
that one
of them shall be enabled to commit an act contrary to the
provisions
of a statute , though
not
expressly prohibited
thereby except by the imposition
of a penalty , the agree-
ment is illegal
and void (p).
This principle
is sometimes
applicable in an action for the price of goods.
Statutes
affecting the right
to
recover the
price
of goods by a
vendor who has failed
to comply with their
requirements
are of two kinds ; the one class
of statutes having
for its
object the raising and protection of the revenue , the other
class being directed either to the protection of buyers and
consumers, or to
some
object of public
policy .
In con-
nection with the first -mentioned of these
two classes
the
difficulty
most likely to occur to the practitioner will be
in determining
whether
the
infliction
of a penalty
was
meant by the legislature
to imply a prohibition
of the
contract .
In connection with the latter
class , the inquiry
will most likely
be whether
by reason of the
vendor's
non -compliance with certain statutory provisions , the law
will decline to imply a promise by the purchaser
to pay
for the goods sold (q).
Again, from the current
of reported
cases we collect , Fraud .
that where any one has by fraud
or wilful misrepresen-
tation induced
another to contract or to part with goods
under
the
belief that
such
representation
was true ,
a
fraud has been committed which will not be tolerated by
our law.
And the fact that such fraud was practised may
be alleged with a view to annulling the contract , and
to
compelling
restitution
of property
transferred
or money

paid in pursuance of it (r).
Fraud destroys a contract ab
initio , so that a fraudulent
seller is precluded from setting
up and insisting on the contract ,-a fraudulent
purchaser
gets no title under it.
Such , doubtless , is the general
principle
to be applied ;
a question of more nicety is this
-What misstatement will-what will not-vitiate a con-
tract ? (s)
It is
clear
that if the
vendor of a
chattel ,
during the
negociations
preliminary
to
its
sale, place
fairly before
or within reach of the intended
purchaser
facts
and
documents
whence
may be drawn
right
in-
ferences
as to
its
value ,
and if the
purchaser
do
not
choose
to avail himself of the means of knowledge
thus
afforded, or if he fail in deducing
true
inferences from
them , he will have
but himself to
blame
should
the
purchase
prove
disadvantageous , for
a vendor
is
not
bound in law to explain
fully and completely everything
which
he may be cognizant of affecting the value of the
property
which
is
the
subject -matter of the
contract .
Statements , moreover , false , but collateral to the contract ,
cannot be made available
to nullify it .
Still less can the
expression of an opinion by the vendor , the grounds
and
reasonableness of which may be examined by the vendee ,
be relied upon to vitiate the contract .
The representation ,
to avail for such purpose , must
be shown to have given
rise to the contracting
of the other party-there must
have been dolus dans locum contractui-fraud
inducing
to
the contract- in order that the vendee
may obtain relief
from the contract
into which he has thus fraudulently
been induced to enter.
(r) Fraud avoids a contract only
where it is the
ground
of the
con-
tract , and where , unless it had been
employed , the contract would never
have been made ; per Lord Wens-
leydale , Smith v. Kay, 7 H. L. Cas.

question

which case, although
decided
with reference to realty , principles

BREACHES

171
The fundamental
rule , however , that
fraud will vitiate
everything , is sometimes modified by circumstances , ex.gr.,
where a person has by fraud been induced to contract , he
may elect whether he will adopt the contract or repudiate
it ; and if, with notice of the fraud , he adopts the con-
tract , he
cannot
afterwards
repudiate
it (t).
Further ,
where a contract of sale has intervened , preference
will
sometimes be given to the title of an honest purchaser
over that of a vendor who has been cheated
and defrauded
of his goods. If A. , through
B.'s fraud , be induced
to
contract with him for the sale of goods , and the goods
be delivered to B. in pursuance of the contract , and B.
transfer
them bond fide and for value to C. , C. will have
a good title as against A. , who afterwards
seeks
to dis-
affirm the contract into which
he has been inveigled (u).
The spirit of this
proposition
favours
the
quieting
of
titles to chattel property , and
so tends to the expansion
of trade , which most
flourishes when
confidence is best
assured.
ket overt.
Nay, in favour
of the contract
of
sale , and
to give sale in mar-
security to titles
resting
upon it, our customary law long
since deviated from its well -established doctrine , that the
absolute owner of a chattel
cannot be prejudiced , so far
as concerns his right therein , by the act of a third person
in reference
to it done in his
absence
without his acqui-
escence
or knowledge , for
the general rule is, that the
sale of anything
vendible , in market overt , (that is , open ) ,
shall
not only be good between the parties
thereto , but
also be binding on all those who have any right of pro-
perty therein (x).
And for this purpose , the Mirror (y)

the value of twenty

witnesses (2).
Market overt in the
country is
only held
on the
special
days, provided
for
particular
towns by charter or prescription
; but in London
every day, except Sunday , is market day (a).
The market

overt (b) ; but in London
every

publicly to sale , is market
overt , for such things
only as the owner professes to trade in (c) .
But a sale
by sample is not
entitled
to the privileges
of a sale in
market overt (d).
If, then , my goods
are
stolen from
me, and
sold , out
of market overt , my property in them is not altered , and
I may take them wherever I find them.
And it is ex-
pressly provided by statute

of any goods , wrongfully taken , to
any
pawnbroker in
London , or within two miles
thereof , shall

therefore made an exception to the general
rule .
And ,
even in market overt , if the goods be the property of the
crown , such sale (though

lunatics , and men beyond sea or in prison .
So likewise , if the
buyer know the property not to be

in the trans-
action ; if he know the seller

If a man buys his own goods in

witnesses , and tenders to the person in possession such
price as he bona fide paid for him in market overt.
But
in case the requirements
before mentioned be not complied

By the civil law (7)
an implied

was annexed
to every sale, in respect to the title of the vendor ; but by
our law no warranty of title
is implied
upon the
sale of
goods, although upon this
abstract rule numerous excep-
tions are engrafted ,-as where goods are sold by a shop-
keeper in the ordinary course of his business , or under an
executory contract , or under circumstances
from which
a
jury may infer a warranty (m).

1st. Where
goods
are in
esse, and may be inspected
by the buyer , and there is no fraud
on the part of the
seller , the maxim
caveat
emptor
applies ; the
purchaser
takes them
at his risk ,
even though the
defect which
exists in them is latent , and not discoverable
on exami-
nation ,
at least where the seller
is neither
the grower
nor the manufacturer .
The buyer in such a case has the
opportunity
of exercising his judgment
upon the matter ,
and if the result
of his
inspection
be unsatisfactory , or
if he distrust
his own judgment, he may , if he
chooses ,
require an express warranty .
In such a case it is not an
implied
term of the contract
of sale that the goods are
of any particular
quality or are merchantable (p) .
2ndly.
Where
there
is
a sale of a definite
existing
chattel ,
specifically
described ,
the
actual
condition
of
which
is capable of being
ascertained by either
party ,
there is no implied warranty
as to quality (q) .
3rdly . Where a known , described , and defined article is
ordered of a manufacturer , although
stated to be required
by the
purchaser
for
a particular
purpose , still , if the
known , described , and defined thing be actually
supplied ,
there
is no warranty
that it shall answer the particular
purpose intended by the buyer (r) .
4thly. Where a manufacturer
or a dealer contracts to
supply an article which
he manufactures
or produces , or
in which
he deals , to be applied
to a particular
purpose ,
so that the buyer necessarily trusts
to the judgment or
skill of the manufacturer
or dealer, a warranty
is inferred
that the said article shall be reasonably
fit
for the purpose
to
which
it
is
to
be applied
.
In such
a
case
,
the buyer
trusts
to
the manufacturer
or
dealer
,
and relies upon his
judgment

a
manufacturer
undertakes
to
supply
goods manufactured by himself , or in which
he deals , but
which the
vendee
has
not
had
an
opportunity
of in-
specting , it is
an implied
term in the contract
that
a
merchantable article shall be supplied (t).
6thly. Another
class of cases is that of goods bought
under
a
specified
commercial
description
by sample
or
even after inspection of bulk.
Here it is an implied
term ,
notwithstanding
the sample or inspection , that the goods
shall
reasonably
answer
the
specified
description
in
its
commercial
sense .
The sample in any such case is looked
upon
as
a mere expression of the quality
of the article ,
not of its
essential character ,
and
notwithstanding
the
bulk be fairly
shown
or agree with the
sample ,
yet if
from
adulteration
or other
cause , not appearing
by the
inspection or sample , though not known to the
seller , the
bulk
does
not
reasonably
answer
the
description
in
a
commercial
sense , the seller is liable .
So that
neither
inspection of bulk nor use of sample absolutely excludes
an inquiry whether
the thing supplied
was otherwise in
accordance
with the contract
(u).
Within
the
scope
of
one or other
of the foregoing
propositions
a state of facts involving
a question
as to
implied warranty of goods sold will
probably be found to
fall , and where title or quality
is expressly warranted the
remarks
made at a former
page (a)
are
applicable .
A
question , however , of much
practical
importance , and by
no means free from difficulty , here presents itself.
Every
contract of sale involves two things , the bargain
and the
transfer of the property to which
it has relation (y) , and

acceptance ofgoods , or in respect of their defective quality ,
a
criterion
may
be
needed
for
determining
the proper
measure of damages applicable
for such breach of con-
tract .
Generally
speaking , it is that amount of pecuniary
loss which might be reasonably expected in the ordinary
course of things to flow from the non-fulfilment of the con-
tract , and to be the natural consequence
of it. Damage , how-
ever, which actually flowed from the breach of contract may
chance to be irrecoverable .
Thus the buyer of an article
may have sustained
a loss from
the non-delivery of such
article , which he intended
to apply to
a special purpose ,
and which , if applied to that special purpose , would have
been productive of a certain special amount of profit .
Yet
the seller cannot be called upon to make good that loss , if
it was not within the scope
of his contemplation
that the
thing would
be applied to the purpose from which
such
special
profit
might result .
But
the
seller
should
pay
damages only to the
extent to which
he
contemplated
that , in the event of his not fulfilling his contract
by the
delivery of the article , the profit which would
be realised.
if the article had been delivered would be lost to the other
party-to that extent he ought to pay ; for the buyer has
lost the larger
amount , and there can be no hardship
or
injustice in making
the seller liable to compensate him in
damages
so far as the seller understood
and believed that
the article would
be applied
to the ordinary purposes to
which it was capable of being applied (≈).

another ," unless the " agreement " upon which such action
is brought , or some memorandum
or note thereof be in
writing signed by the party to be charged
therewith , or
some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized .
The party signing
a guarantie
thereby undertakes
that
he will ,
on the
happening of
a
contingency ,
become
answerable for the debt or default of a third person , and
any such undertaking
or engagement must , by virtue of
the
statute ,
be in writing ; if verbal
only , " no action
shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant " there-
upon .
To fall within the statute , however , the promise
must
be to answer for the debt , default , or miscarriage of another
person for which that
other
remains
liable ; ex. gr., the
defendant , in consideration
that
the plaintiff would
de-
liver his horse to A. , promised
that A. should
redeliver
him
safe ; this was held to be a collateral
undertaking
for another , and therefore not enforceable by action with-
out writing ; for " where the undertaker
comes
in aid only
to procure
a credit
to the party , in that
case
there is a
remedy against both , and both
are
answerable
according
to their distinct
engagements ; but where the whole credit
is given to the undertaker , so that the other party is but
as his servant , and there is no remedy against him, this is
not a collateral
undertaking " (a).
The difference indeed
is
obvious
between
a guarantie
and
a substitution
of
liability-between
the
case
where
the
liability
of the
party
originally liable
is extinguished
and
determined ,
and
the
case
where there is an assumption of liability
upon a contingency-the contingency , viz . , of some
one
else making
a default in payment (b).

the statute must be made to that person to whom another
is or is about to become
chargeable (c) .
The policy of that particular
clause of the 4th section
of the Statute of Frauds now spoken of, obviously was to
diminish
fraud and perjury , which either
had
been
found
by experience , or were judged likely to arise from trusting
to evidence
of less authority
than
that of a written
docu-
ment , for fixing upon a defendant responsibility
for a debt
or default for which another person was primarily liable .
The clause in question was at first thought to have effected
its object, but a mode of evading it was devised by shaping
the demand , not upon a special promise of the defendant
-which alone is within the
letter of the
statute-but
upon a wrong or tort
occasioned
to the plaintiff by some
false or fraudulent
representation of the defendant , made
in
order to induce
him
(the plaintiff ) to contract with
some third person , evidence
of such representation when
oral
only
and
insufficient
therefore ,
by reason of the
statute , to support
an action
ex
contractu , being
relied
upon to sustain an action founded upon tort (d).
A prac-
tice thus
crept in of fixing a person with the
debt of
another
by verbal
evidence of a representation
as to the
solvency or trustworthiness
of that
other , and proof that
credit was given on the faith of that representation , and
damage
sustained
consequent
on
its
incorrectness (e) .
To support
such an action
proof of fraud was of course
needed (ƒ) , but a jury would be prone to infer fraud from
very slight and insufficient
proofs .
In order therefore to
remedy the inconvenience
resulting
from the systematic
evasion of the Statute of Frauds
thus resorted to, an eva-
sion for repression of which our common law was ineffec-
tual, Lord Tenterden introduced into the statute 9 Geo . 4,

be brought whereby to charge any person upon any repre-
sentation made concerning
the credit , trade , or dealings
of any other person to the intent that
such person
may
obtain credit , money , or goods upon it, unless such repre-
sentation be made in writing, signed by the party to he
charged therewith .
There can be no doubt that the above
clause of Lord
Tenterden's Act has operated
beneficially , has prevented
much
vexatious
litigation, and
has
put a stop
to the
attempts
which had
before
been
successfully
made to
elude the provisions
of the
Statute
of Frauds
having
reference to guaranties .
This
section
affects the nature
of the
evidence which
must
be adduced to support
an
action for false representation , not the general
principles
of law upon which it rests.
To
sustain
such an action
there must be injury and damage, and, if proof of these
be present , the jury will have to say whether
the former
produced the latter , for the damage laid
and relied upon
by the plaintiff must have resulted not too remotely from
the alleged injury in order that an action for false repre-
sentation may be maintainable . Further , as regards the evi-
dence requisite to support such an action : If a comparison
be instituted
between the 6th section of Lord Tenterden's
Act
and the
4th
section of the
Statute of Frauds, we
shall find that under the former
statute no action
can be
maintained against a man for falsely representing his friend
to be a person of substance, or as one to whom
credit
might fairly be extended
, unless such representation
be in
writing, signed by himself ; whereas, under
the 4th sec-
tion of the
Statute of Frauds ,
one may be sued on an
ordinary
guarantie to be answerable
for another's
debt if
the promise
to pay be given
in writing ,
signed
by his
authorised
agent , i. e. , on the
Statute of Frauds
a person
is exposed
to be charged by the verbal statement of another
that
he had authority
to sign ;
under Lord Tenterden's
Act this is not so (g).

BREACHES

The word " agreement ," used in the 4th
section of the
Statute of Frauds , has been held to include the considera-
tion as well as the promise which it supports (h), and , in
construing
a guarantie
worded by persons
unskilled
in
legal
technicalities , a question
often
arose of this kind :
Did the consideration sufficiently appear on the face of the
instrument , or was it to be necessarily
inferred
from the
wording of it ? (i)
The difficulty experienced in solving
this question has been removed by the 3rd section of the
Mercantile
Law Amendment
Act
( 19 & 20 Vict. c. 97) ,
enacting that no guarantie shall be deemed
invalid
to sup-
port an action by reason only that the consideration
for
the promise does not appear
in writing or by necessary in-
ference from the written
document .
This statutory
pro-
vision
does
not render a consideration
unnecessary to a
valid guarantie , it merely
dispenses with the necessity of
disclosing
or indicating
the existence of such consideration
upon the instrument
itself (k) .
Now as formerly
will a
guarantie of a past debt, unless supported by some
other
consideration ,
be inefficacious
;
now
as formerly
may
a
nice and difficult
question arise upon a guarantie of this
kind :-Do
its terms clearly import
that the defendant's
promise was to guarantie
a debt previously
incurred ? or
do they point rather in this direction
and to this
under-
standing between the parties , that credit shall continue to
be extended and additional
goods be supplied or money be
advanced by the plaintiff to the
person guarantied ? (7)

3. Another
clause of the 4th section of the
Statute of
Frauds
enacts
that : " No
action
shall be
brought
to
charge any person upon any agreement that is not to be
performed within the space
of one year from the making
thereof , unless
the
agreement
upon
which
such
action
shall be brought
or some memorandum
or note thereof
shall
be in writing , and signed by the party to be charged
therewith , or some
other person
thereunto by him law-
fully authorised ."
Agreements falling within this provi-
sion of the
statute are not uncommon .
Any contract of
service does so which is to continue for a year, yet not to
commence until
a
future
day (p),
or any contract for
publishing
a
serial
work
meant
to
extend
beyond
a
year (q).
It was long since decided that an agreement falling within
this
statutory
provision
must be such as from
its terms
appears to be incapable of performance within the year .
For instance , an action was brought upon an agreement by
which the defendant promised for one guinea paid down to
give
the plaintiff
so
many
on the day of his marriage .
The defendant not having been married within a year , the
question was whether
the agreement ought to have been
in writing .
This question was answered
in the
negative ,
for " where the agreement is to be performed upon a con-
tingent , and it does not appear within the agreement that
it is to be performed after the year , there a note in writing
is not necessary," but where it appears by the whole tenor
of the agreement that it is to be performed
after the year ,

1. Bill of
exchange.
1. A bill of exchange is a security , invented
among
merchants , for the more
easy remittance of money from
one country
to another .
It is an open letter of request
from A. to B. , desiring B. to pay a sum named therein to
a third person on A.'s account ; by which means a man at
the most distant
part of the world may have money re-
mitted to him
from any trading
country .
If A.
lives in
Jamaica, and owes B. , who lives in England , 1000 %. , now
if C. be going
from England to Jamaica, he may pay B.
this 10007. , and take
a bill of exchange drawn by B. in
England upon A. in Jamaica, and receive it when he comes
thither .
Thus does B. receive
his debt , at any distance of
place, by transferring it to C.; who carries over his money
in paper credit , without
danger of robbery or loss .
This
method is said to have been brought
into general
use by
the Jews
and
Lombards , when
banished , in order
the
more easily to draw their effects
out of France
and Eng-
land , into
those countries in which
they had chosen to
reside.
But the invention of it was a little
earlier : for
the Jews were banished out of Guienne in 1287 , and out
of England in 1290 (6) .
In mercantile phraseology , such

The person who writes

is called in law the drawer ; he to whom it is

person, to
whom
it is payable

The most remarkable
incident or quality
attaching to a Assignment

its
transferability

.
It
was
a
rule of our common law
that
a

in

(c)
could not
be
assigned
or

(d),
because
it
was thought
to
be
a
great encourage-
ment
to
litigiousness
if
a
man were allowed
to
make over
to
a
stranger his right
of
going
to
law
;
and
,
in
compliance
with this ancient principle
,
the form
of
assigning
a
debt
is
still
in
the
nature of
a
declaration
of

,
and an

to
permit
the

of

,
in

And therefore

drawn in the form
usual
amongst
merchants , be trans-
ferred
and
assigned from the
payee
to any other
man ;
contrary to the general
rule of the
common law that no
chose in action is assignable .
This
assignment being the
life of paper
credit , it may be well to mention a few of
the
principal
incidents
attending
it when regular , and
such
as to charge the
drawer with the payment of the
debt to persons other than those with whom he originally
contracted .
The
quality of negotiability
may be imparted to a bill
of exchange by the form in which it was originally drawn ,
or may be communicated to it by indorsement . If indeed
the bill be drawn
payable to A. , A only can sue upon the
bill , which in this
case will
not be at all or in any sense
negotiable . If the bill be drawn payable to " A. or order,"
A. can, by writing his name in dorso, or on the back of
the instrument , transfer or assign over to another
person ,
called
the
indorsee ,
his right
and
title
to it,
either
generally or specially , in this
latter
case making
the bill
payable to B. by name or order. If the bill be drawn
payable to " A. or bearer," it will be perfectly negotiable ,
and may
pass , by delivery ,
from
one person to another
in infinitum , conferring
rights and imposing
obligations
which are very definite and stringent .
The indorsement , however , of a bill of exchange must ,
in order to be
efficacious , have been made
animo in-
dorsandi , and when thus made and perfected by delivery
the effect of the transaction is to vest in the indorsee the
sole and
exclusive
right to
sue upon the instrument
.
When , indeed, we speak of a bill as being
transferable
by indorsement , we ordinarily
mean that the right to the
bill and the right to sue upon it will pass from A. to B. if
A. write his name upon the back of the bill and deliver it
to B. , intending
to pass it to him as indorsee .
And if in
an action by indorsee and holder against indorser of a bill
prima facie proof be given of the indorsement , the burden
will thus be cast on the defendant of showing that the de-

of
an unaccepted
bill should go
to
the
drawee
,
and offer his bill for
acceptance
.
If
the drawee
refuse
to
accept the bill
,
the holder may
,
after giving due
notice
of
dishonour
,
sue
the
drawer
and
indorsers
,
without waiting till the bill becomes
due
,
according
to
the
terms
of

is

ment by him to pay according to the tenor of his accept-
ance (s).
When a bill of exchange has been drawn ,
accepted ,
and indorsed , independent and different contracts arise on
the parts respectively of those who drew and accepted
the
bill with the
indorsee
or holder .
The
person
who
ac-
cepted
the bill is primarily and absolutely
liable to pay
it ; the person who drew the bill is liable
only upon the
contingencies of default being made by the acceptor, and
of the holder's performing
certain conditions
precedent to
his right of suit being
complete , viz . , presenting the bill ,
and giving due notice of the failure of the acceptor to pay
it upon presentment .
The contracts created
and evidenced
by the bill , so far as regards the principal
parties to it , are
thus essentially distinct ; and according
as the action on a
bill is brought against this or that party to it, so will the
form of declaration in an action framed upon the idea of
an undertaking
by him necessarily vary .
And whatsoever
proceedings
upon the bill be taken it must
be borne in
mind that the receipt of a bill of exchange in respect of a
debt does not extinguish
the debt , it merely postpones the
period of payment ; and if for some reason
or other the
remedy upon the bill , when arrived
at maturity , fail ,
a
remedy still remains in respect of the original

tion for the bill .

The conditions

honoured bill as
against
any

intermediate

and the acceptor (who is absolutely
liable upon it) are presentment and notice of dishonour .
Payment of the bill , when refused , must be demanded
of the drawer as soon as conveniently may be : for though ,
when one draws a bill of exchange , he subjects himself to
payment of it, if the person on whom it is drawn refuses
either to accept or pay it, yet this is subject to a condition
that if the bill be not paid when due, the person to whom

it is payable , or the holder , shall in convenient
time
give
the drawer
notice
thereof ;
for ,
otherwise ,
the law will
imply it paid : since it would be prejudicial
to commerce ,
if a bill might rise up to charge the drawer
at any dis-
tance of
time
;
when
meanwhile
all
reckonings
and
accounts might
have been adjusted
between the drawer
and the drawee .
If the bill be an indorsed bill , and the indorsee
cannot
get the drawee to discharge it, he may call upon either the
drawer , or the indorser , or, if the bill has been negotiated
through many hands , upon any of the indorsers
; for each
indorser is in the nature of a new drawer , and is a war-
rantor
for the
payment of the bill , which
is frequently
taken in payment as much upon the credit of the indorser
as of the drawer .
And if such indorser , so called upon ,
has the name or names of one or more indorsers
prior to
his
own , to each of whom he is properly
an indorsee , he
is also at liberty to call upon any of them to make him
satisfaction
; and so upwards .
But the first indorser of a
dishonoured bill has nobody to resort to but the drawer .
The bill must
be presented for payment in due time ,
that
is ,
on the last of the three
days of grace ,
to the
acceptor, if the
acceptance
be general (t) , or at the place
named upon the bill if the acceptance
be qualified .
Presentment
for payment must be made at the maturity
of the bill .
It is a well -known rule that where a creditor
gives time to his principal
debtor , there being
a surety
to secure payment of the debt, and does so without consent
of, or communication with, such surety , the surety is dis-
charged , because
he is thus placed in a new situation , and
exposed to a risk and contingency to which he would not

a man to give up or renounce a right appertaining
to him-
self alone, he cannot renounce on behalf of another a right
which belongs to him ; at least , should he assume to do so ,
our law will protect that other from being prejudiced
by
the act , and will, perhaps , place him
in a position
more
favourable
than
that which he had before occupied , and
exonerate him from liabilities which
had before attached
to him.
In accordance with the
above principle , and on
general
grounds of expediency , our law will
not
permit
the responsibility
of any party to a negotiable
instrument
intermediate between the holder and the person primarily
liable upon it to be prejudiced by any secret understanding
between those
two
persons . If this
rule were relaxed ,
traders
would
be reluctant
to put their names to nego-
tiable
paper .
The
proposition
therefore was long
since
established
(v) that
the holder of a bill of exchange , by
giving time to the acceptor, discharges the other parties
to
it, for the acceptor of a bill is the party principally,
and in the first place , liable
upon it ; the other
parties
whose
names
appear
on the
instrument
as
making,
drawing , or indorsing it are , in legal contemplation
, sure-
ties only (x) ; and , as above intimated , any private
agree-
ment between a creditor
and his principal
for a variation
in the terms of their
contract
is viewed as a fraud
upon
the surety , who is accordingly , ipso facto , discharged
and
exonerated
from
the
collateral
or
contingent
liability
which he had assumed .
dishonour.
The rule ordinarily
applicable is that , in order to charge Notice of
the drawer of a bill ,
due notice of dishonour
must be
given him , the want of notice of dishonour being , indeed ,
tantamount
to payment by him, for the law presumes ,
regard
being
had
to the
usual
course of
commercial
dealing , that the bill is drawn on account of effects of the
party who drew it being in the hands of the person upon

whom it is drawn , and who accepts the bill. If the drawer
has notice that the bill is not paid (or not accepted , for the
rule applies also to that state of things ) , he may then at
once withdraw his effects from the hands of him upon whom
the bill was drawn , and so may possibly
protect himself
by getting back the consideration
for the bill. If, how-
ever , the party last named had at the time of drawing the
bill no effects in the hands of the drawee , the reason of
the rule requiring
notice of dishonour fails , and no notice
of dishonour
need
be given him (y) .
The notice of dishonour must expressly or by reasonable
intendment
convey information
that the bill has been dis-
honoured , and demand payment of it (2), and although
no
period can be named within which , under all circumstances ,
it should be given , the rule upon this point has during the
last century become
tolerably
definite , the question what
is reasonable
notice
having
been held to be
one of law,
regard
being had however to the particular
facts of the
case (a).
Whether the post goes
out this or that
day, at
what
time , and so forth, are matters of fact ;
but where
the facts pertinent
to the matter agitated are
established ,
it becomes
a question of law upon these
facts what notice
may be reasonable and sufficient .
The
rule
now
estab-
lished
as
regards the time for giving notice is that
the
party
sought to
be
charged
upon the bill is entitled to
prompt notice " of
its
dishonour by the acceptor
.

notice send a notice to those he means to charge .

If there are many indorsers , and
the notice in fact travels through
them all-if there has
been no want of diligence

notice will be good .

The rule
applies generally
to

.
There
is
,
however
,
this peculiarity about
a
bill
of
exchange that the considera-
tion for the
promise
evidenced
by
it
will
,
in
the first
instance
,
be
presumed
.
As between the immediate parties
to
a
bill
of

onus lies
on the
defendant of
showing
-
by an apt plea and by apt
evidence
that he
transferred
it
to the holder
without
consideration
,
and
that therefore he cannot
at
suit
of
the plaintiff be made
liable
upon
the bill
.
The
drawer
of
an accommodation
bill cannot successfully
sue the acceptor upon
it
,
and
is
even liable
to
be called on
to
indemnify him
if
compelled
to
take up

(d).
As between parties
to

is
settled
that

with its

the onus

in the
case of a genuine
instrument .
If once a bill is
shown to be tainted with illegality or fraud , the presump-
tion of bona fides , which ordinarily
arises from the indorse-
ment ceases , and a fortiori if the instrument
is proved to
have been forged (e) .
Negotiable
instruments
form an important
part of the
currency of the country , and
are therefore
subjected to
the operation of a fundamental
rule applicable to money .
If such
an
instrument
be transferred
in good faith for
value
before it
is overdue, it becomes
available in the
hands of the holder , notwithstanding
fraud which would
have rendered it unavailable
in the hands of a previous
holder ; though if a bill of exchange be payable to order ,
the holder of the bill must perfect his title to it by indorse-
ment in order that he may not
be
affected
by notice of a
fraud tainting
the instrument
perpetrated
before it came
to his hands .
Upon the maxim , nemo plus juris ad alium
transferre potest quam ipse habet , which
comes
to us from
the Roman law (f) , has thus been engrafted an exception
with a view to facilitating commercial
dealings , and for
promoting
confidence amongst traders in the paper which
they
circulate .
But the operation of this exception has
likewise ,
with
a view to the
maintenance of good faith
and the suppression of fraud ,
been , in accordance
with

of such
a negotiable
instrument
suing
upon it may be
called on by an apt plea to produce it at the trial .
This
tends to prevent
fraud , and to protect
a defendant , who
obviously
ought
not to be in peril of paying
the
bill
twice over.
It is also in conformity with the practice of
merchants
having reference to the payment of the instru
ment in ordinary
course .
By the
custom of traders the
holder of a bill of exchange should (as already stated (i) ) ,
present it at maturity
to the acceptor , demand payment
of its amount , and upon receipt of the money deliver up
the bill ;
the
acceptor , upon
paying
the bill , having
a
right to its
possession for his own security , and as his
voucher and discharge pro tanto in the account between
himself and the party who drew upon him (k).
The rule above
stated
was in its policy sound , as perhaps
might be said of almost every rule adopted into the prac-
tice of merchants , originating
in necessity and tested by
long experience .
Nevertheless the particular
rule adverted
to might
occasionally , if not
relaxed , be productive
of
hardship — perhaps
might
work positive
injustice .
The
holder
of a bill of large
amount
losing
it through
the
negligence of a clerk
or other
agent, in the
absence
of
personal
default ,
might be
without
remedy
upon
it.
Therefore
the
legislature
interposed ,
and by section
87
of the second
Common Law Procedure Act ( 17 & 18 Vict .
c. 125 ) , enacted
that in case of any action founded upon a
bill of exchange or other negotiable
instrument , it shall
be lawful for the court , or a judge , to order that the loss
of such instrument
shall
not be set up , provided
a satis-
factory indemnity be given against the claims of any other
person upon such instrument .
The procedure upon a bill or note has also been simpli-
fied and amended by the under -mentioned statute (7) .

An inland bill of exchange is drawn and payable here ,
or drawn in one part and payable in any other part of the
British Islands (m ).
A bill
drawn
or payable
elsewhere
is (except for stamp purposes (n) ) a foreign bill (o) .
Such
a bill is usually drawn
in parts
which
circulate together ,
at one or more " usances ," the " usance " being the period

2. The relation
of
banker
and

is
of this 2. Cheque.
kind -The
banker
is the depositary
of the
customer's
money, which he, in compliance with usage, undertakes to
pay out
from time to time to the customer's
order evi-
denced by his
cheque .
A cheque is in fact an inland bill
of exchange , drawn
upon the
banker , and payable to the
bearer on demand (u).
It differs however from a bill in
some particulars , for instance , whereas a bill of exchange
is drawn
upon a person who
is expected to, and in the
ordinary course does , accept it, a common cheque , though
drawn upon a banker , is not accepted
by him ; it is under-
stood to be a request or order to pay money instanter when
the order is presented
, and accordingly
does not need to be
accepted
(x).
A cheque passes
from
hand to hand upon
the faith reposed
in the maker of it, and a confidence that
there are funds to his credit at the banker's
sufficing for
liquidation
of the
cheque .
Further ,
as
a cheque
upon a
banker is not usually
accepted , so neither is it usually in-

dorsed.
It may , however , be so , and an action will then
lie by the holder against an indorser of the instrument (y) .
The crossing of a cheque , which
indicates that it must be
passed
through
a banker's
for
presentment ,
is another
characteristic of this instrument
(~) .
Upon the implied undertaking of the banker his liability
to a customer almost wholly depends , and any breach of
duty by the banker causing direct damage to his customer
would be actionable (a) .
A banker
having
in hand suffi-
cient funds of a customer , is bound to honour his
cheque ,
and liable in an action founded
on contract
or breach of
duty for not doing so (b).
The banker must
decide
as to
the genuineness of a cheque drawn upon him, and should
he pay a forged
cheque , must , in the
absence
of gross
negligence by his customer , bear the loss (c) . If a bill be
accepted by
a
customer ,
payable
at his
banker's , the
making the acceptance
payable
there is tantamount
to an
order on the part of the acceptor that the banker
shall
pay the bill to the person who , according to the law mer-
chant , may be capable of giving a good discharge
for it.
Supposing
that the bill has in this
case
been originally
made
payable
to
order , the
acceptance
payable
at
a
banker's operates
as authorising
him to pay the bill to any
one who shall become
holder
of it by a genuine indorse-
ment .
Supposing , again , that the bill has been originally
made payable
to bearer, the
acceptance
payable
at a
banker's
operates
as authorising
him to pay the bill to any
one who
seems
to be the holder of it.
The banker im-
pliedly undertakes
to pay the bill
accordingly , i.
e. in
strict pursuance of, and in conformity with the authority
given to him by his
customer .
He
cannot ,

debit his customer's account with any payment
not made
in accordance with such authority (d).
The ordinary
period of limitation
, viz . , six
years , runs ,
of course, as against the recipient
and holder of a cheque.
A question , however , may
arise of this kind.
Is the
holder
entitled
to retain
the
cheque
thus long without a
possibility of being in that interval prejudiced
as regards
his remedy against the maker of the cheque, by the delay
in presenting it for payment .
For resolving
this question ,
a rule has been
found needful , defining the period within
which presentment of a
cheque
must
be made
in
order
that the
holder
of it
may , in
case
of
failure
of the
banker
on whom it is drawn , have
redress
against the
party
who
transferred
the
cheque.
The
holder
of the
cheque
is bound
to present it
for payment
on the day
after that on which he received it , or if the
cheque
be on
a banker in a distant town , the holder is bound to send it
to his agent there for presentment by the post of the day
after that on which he had it , the agent having
the fol-
lowing day in which
to present the instrument
for pay-
ment (e) .
This rule has been held to apply not merely
as between the parties to the cheque , but
as between the
banker
and his customer , unless , indeed , circumstances
exist where a contract
or duty on the part of the banker
may be implied
to present the cheque earlier for payment ,
or to defer presentment of it till a later period (ƒ) .

lated and restricted by the legislature .
And , in pursuance
of the policy thus
adopted , various
statutes
have been
passed enacting generally
as under :-
Banking
copartnerships in England consisting
of not
more than
six persons , may (except within the
city of
London
or three miles therefrom ) , under
certain
regula-
tions , issue unstamped promissory
notes and bills payable
at or within seven
days
after sight , or within seventy-one
days after date (†) .
It was
formerly
unlawful for banking
companies
of
more than
six persons , during the
continuance
of the
privileges
of the Bank, to borrow , owe , or take up any
money on their bills or notes payable on demand , or at
any time less than six months after date .
This restriction
was, however , relaxed by the
7 Geo . 4 , c. 46 , which per-
mitted banking companies of more than six members to
make and issue their bills and notes at any place beyond
sixty-five miles from
London
( u) , payable on demand , or
otherwise , at
some
place or places specified therein
and
beyond
sixty -five miles from
London ;
such
companies
not having
any place of business
as bankers within that
distance from London .
Again, the
stat. 3 & 4 Will . 4, c.
83 , authorized
any
banking company of more than six members
to make
their bills or notes payable in London by their agent , or
to draw any bill or note upon
any such agent in London ,
payable on demand , or otherwise , in
London
; but by the
(t) Stat . 9 Geo . 4,
c.

This
statute contains
(s. 15) a saving of
the privileges
of the Bank of Eng-
land .
By the 7 & 8 Vict . c. 32, s. 10.
no
new bank of issue was
allowed
to be created subsequent to May 6,
1844 ; and by s. 11, further
restric-
tions were, from the passing of that
act
(July

1844),
placed
upon

(u) The restriction
as to distance
did
not
extend
to
bills
for the
amount of 50%. or upwards , payable
in London or elsewhere , at any pe-
riod after date
or

this limit
of 501. seems to

3 & 4 Will. 4, c. 98 , s . 2 , no such company can, during
the continuance of the privileges of the Bank of England ,
make or issue in London , or within sixty -five miles thereof,
any bill, or note , or engagement for the payment of money
on demand , or upon which
any person holding
the same
may obtain
payment
on demand ; though it is lawful for
any corporation

distance
than
sixty-five

any house of business
or esta-

But no such bill or

The authority
contained in the

It was indeed at one time
supposed that
the
statute re-
ferred to prohibited
companies of more than six members
from carrying
on any banking
business within the above-
mentioned
limits ; but the
doubts
on this
head were
removed by the
3rd section of the stat. 3 & 4 Will. 4, c.

may
carry

reversionary
interest
in the same, and acquires
a new
property in the price or reward .
There is one species
of this price or reward , the most
usual of any , concerning which
good and learned men in
former
times
perplexed
themselves , by
raising
doubts
about
its
legality
in
foro conscientiæ
.
That
is
,
when money
is
lent on
a
contract
to
receive
not only the principal
sum
again
,
but also an increase by way
of
compensation for
its use
;
which generally
is
called
interest by those who
think
it
lawful
,
or
,
when
excessive
,
usury
.
The enemies
to
interest
in
general
have indeed
made no distinction
between that and usury
,
holding
any increase
of
money
to
be indefensible
.
And this opinion they partly grounded
on the prohibition
of
it
by the law
of
Moses among the
Jews
,
and condemned the practice
of
taking
interest
,
as
being contrary
to
the divine law
,
both natural and revealed
.
The canon law
(a),
moreover
,
proscribed
the taking any
,
the least
,
increase for the loan
of
money
as
a
mortal sin
.
But
,
in
answer
to
this
,
it
has been
observed
,
that
the
Mosaical
precept
was
clearly
a
political
,
not
a
moral
ordinance
.
It
only
prohibited
the
Jews
from
taking
usury from their brethren the Jews
;
but
in
express
words
permitted them
to
take
it
of
a
stranger
(b)
;
which
shows
that the taking of moderate usury
,
or
a
reward for the
use
,
for
so
the word signifies
,
is
not malum
in
se;
since
it
was allowed where any but an Israelite
was concerned
.
Moreover
,
although
,
as
noticed
at
a
former
page
(c),
money
was
originally
used
only
for the
purposes
of
exchange
,
yet the laws
of
any state may
be
well justified
in
permitting
it
to
be
turned
to
the purposes
of
profit
,
if
the convenience
of
society
(
the great end for which money
was invented
)
require
it
.
And that the allowance of
interest
tends greatly
to
the benefit
of
the public
,
espe-
cially
in
a
trading
country
,
appears
from the generally

acknowledged
principle ,
that
commerce
cannot
subsist
without
mutual
and
extensive
credit .
Unless
money
therefore
can be borrowed , trade cannot
be carried
on :
and if no premium
were allowed
for the hire of money ,
few persons would
care to lend it ; or at least the ease of
borrowing
at a short warning
(which is the life of com-
merce) would
be entirely at an end .
Thus , in the dark
ages of monkish
superstition
and civil
tyranny ,
when
interest
was laid under
a total
interdict , commerce was
also at its lowest
ebb , and fell entirely into the hands of
the Jews and
Lombards
: but when men's minds
began
to be more enlarged , when
true religion
and real liberty
revived , commerce grew again into credit ; and introduced
with itself its inseparable companion , the doctrine of loans
upon
interest .
And ,
as to
any
scruples
of conscience,
since all other conveniences of life may either
be bought
or hired , but money can only be hired , there seems
to be
no greater oppression in taking a recompense or price for
the hire
of this , than
of any
other
convenience .
To
demand an exorbitant
price is equally
contrary
to con-
science, for the loan of a horse , or the loan of a sum of
money
but a reasonable equivalent for the temporary in-
convenience , which the owner may feel by the want of it ,
and for the hazard of his losing it entirely , is not more
immoral in one case than it is in the other .
Indeed the
absolute prohibition
of lending
upon any , even moderate
interest , would
introduce
the very inconvenience which it
might seem meant
to
remedy .
The
necessity of indi-
viduals will make borrowing
unavoidable .
Unless profit
for the loan of money were allowed by law, there would
be but few lenders ; and those principally bad men , who
would break through the law, and take a profit ; and then
would endeavour to indemnify themselves from the danger
of the penalty , by making that profit exorbitant .
Therefore ,
as well in other
countries
as in our
own ,
where laws against
usury have existed , a capital
distinc-
tion has been made between a moderate and an exorbitant

profit for the use of money .
The
Romans
at
one time
allowed
centesima , one per cent . monthly , or twelve per
cent. per annum , to be taken for common loans ; and Jus-
tinian (d) reduced it to four per cent . ; but allowed higher
interest
to be taken
of merchants ,
because
there the
hazard
was
greater .
Grotius
informs
us (e), that , in
Holland, the
rate
of
interest
was
eight
per
cent .
on
common
loans , but
twelve
to
merchants .
And
Lord
Bacon
was
desirous of introducing
a
similar
policy in
England (f) : but our law established
one standard for
all alike , where the pledge or security itself was not put
in jeopardy .
With us the rate of legal
interest , during
the existence of usury laws , varied and
decreased
accord-
ing as the quantity of specie in the kingdom
increased by
accessions
of trade , the introduction
of paper credit , and
other circumstances (g) .
Until , in the year 1854 , all the
then existing laws against usury were, by the 17 &
18 Vict .
c. 90, entirely
repealed
(h) .
The
exorbitance
or moderation
of interest
for money
lent depends , in truth, upon two circumstances : the in-
convenience of parting
with it for the present , and the
hazard of losing it entirely .
The
inconvenience to indi-
vidual lenders can never
be estimated by laws ; the current
rate , therefore , of interest must depend upon the usual or
general inconvenience .
This results entirely from the quan-
tity of specie or current money in the kingdom
: for , the
more specie there is circulating
in any nation , the greater
superfluity there will be , beyond what is necessary to carry

on the business of exchange and the common concerns of
life. In every nation or public community , there is a certain
quantity of money
thus necessary ; which
a person well
skilled
in political arithmetic
might calculate
almost
as
exactly , as a private banker could estimate the demand for
running
cash in his
own till :
all above
this
necessary
quantity may be spared , or lent , without
much inconveni-
ence to the respective lenders ; and the greater this national
superfluity
is , the more numerous will be the lenders , and
the lower will
the
current
rate
of
interest
ordinarily
be :
but , where
there is not
enough
circulating
cash ,
or barely enough , to answer the daily uses of the pub-
lic, interest will
be proportionably
high ; for lenders will
be but few , as
few can submit
to the
inconvenience of
lending .
So also the hazard of loss has its weight in the regula-
tion of interest : the better the security , the lower will the
interest
be ; the rate of interest being generally in a com-
pound
ratio , formed
out of the inconvenience , and the
hazard .
And
as , if there
were no inconvenience , there
should be no interest but what is equivalent to the hazard ,
so , if there were no hazard , there ought to be no interest ,
save only
what
arises
from the
mere inconvenience
of
lending .
Thus , if the quantity
of specie
in
a nation
be
such, that the general inconvenience of lending
for a year
is computed to amount to three per cent.: a man having
money by him will
perhaps lend it upon
good personal
security at five per cent . , allowing
two for the hazard
run ;
he will lend it upon landed
security or mortgage
at four
per cent., the
hazard
being
proportionably
less ; but he
will lend it to the state, on the maintenance of which all
his property
depends
, at three per cent . , the hazard being
none at all.
But formerly
the hazard might sometimes
have been greater than the rate of interest allowed under
a restrictive
law would
compensate.
And this gave rise
to various
species
of contracts by way of insurance
or
otherwise , which will here be briefly adverted to .

of
a mortgage
of a
ship ;
when
the master
takes up
money to enable him to carry on his voyage, and pledges
the keel or bottom of the ship (partem pro toto) as a secu-
rity for its re-payment .
In which
case , it is understood ,
that , if the ship be lost , the lender loses
also his whole
money ; but , if it returns in safety , then he shall
receive
back his principal , and also the premium or interest agreed
upon.
And this is allowed
to be a valid
contract in all
trading nations , for the benefit of commerce, and by reason
of the extraordinary
hazard run by the lender (k) . In this
case the ship and tackle , if brought home , are answerable
(as well as the person of the
borrower ) for the money
lent, and nothing
short of an actual
total
loss will dis-
charge the borrower (1).
If the loan is not upon the vessel , but upon the goods
and
merchandize ,
which
must
necessarily
be
sold
or
exchanged in the course of the voyage, then only the bor-
rower , personally , is bound to answer the contract ; who
therefore
in
this
case
is
said
to

B. , that upon A.'s paying
a premium
equivalent

event (g) .
This is founded upon one of the same
principles
as the doctrine of interest upon loans , that of
hazard ; but not that of inconvenience .
For , if I insure
a ship to the Levant , and back again , at five per cent.;
here I calculate
the chance that she
performs her voyage,
to be twenty to one against her being lost : and , if she be
lost , I lose

To the time of queen Elizabeth is referable the first of Marine
our
statutes (r)
concerning
marine
insurance , its object
having
been to establish
a special tribunal
for the deter-
mination of cases connected therewith ; or rather to confirm
and extend the authority
of one which the
merchants of
London had
previously
established .
The
special
court
thus erected for deciding questions on policies of insurance
fell , however , on account of
its
defective jurisdiction
,
into
disuse
;
it
having
been decided
,
that
a
judgment
therein
for the defendant did not protect him from
a
subsequent
action for the same
cause
(s).
It
must not
,
indeed
,
be
supposed that maritime
insur-
ance originated with the statute
of
Elizabeth just cited
,
or
was
,
even
at
the date
of
its passing
,
of
recent
existence
here
;
on the contrary
,
the preamble
of
the act recites that
it
had been
"

have made if it had
been
brought
in the name of the
person by whom
or for whose account the
policy
sued
upon was effected .
The wording
of a sea policy of insurance is peculiar
;
but the mercantile world have long
been
used to it, and
every material
portion
of it has been
diligently scanned
by lawyers , and
been
illustrated
by the decisions of our
courts .
It is to be construed according
to the same rules
as other
written
contracts ,
and by reference
to the in-
tention of the parties , which must
be gathered from
the
words of the instrument and
the
surrounding
circum-
stances . If the words of the
instrument
are
clear in
themselves , the instrument must be construed accordingly ;
but if its words
are
susceptible of more meanings
than
one, the judge must inform
himself of their true signifi-
cance by the aid of the jury and the surrounding
circum-
stances
which bear upon the contract (d).
The person underwriting
a
sea policy
is guided
in
so
doing by these considerations .
He
calculates
and
esti-
mates, as best he may , the price
at which he may safely
indemnify
the trader , proposing
to insure , against
risks ,
regard being had to the nature of the voyage to be per-
formed , and the usual
course and manner of making it.
He takes the risk upon the supposition
that whatever is
usual or necessary will be done.
And if the risk is varied ,
or the voyage is altered , by the fault of the owner or master
of the ship , the insurer
ceases to be liable .
Marine
insurance is thus
essentially
a contract of in-
demnity against the perils of the voyage enumerated in the
policy (e) ; the dangers usually
insured against , being " of
the seas , men of war , fire , enemies
, pirates , rovers , thieves ,

or
quality

and all other perils ( ) , losses, and misfortunes ."
Now, supposing a loss , whether of ship , cargo , or freight ,
to have occurred , it may, regard being had to the above
words , sometimes
be matter of contention
whether
the
loss resulted from a peril insured
against , or whether in
respect of it the underwriters
are exempt from liability (¿).
And although
difficulty
may be felt in satisfactorily
dis-
criminating
between
particular
cases and peculiar
states of
facts , and although it be impossible
to draw any precise
line upon this subject , the general rule is, that where mis-
chief arises from
perils of the
seas , and the natural
and
almost inevitable
consequence
of that mischief is to create
further
mischievous
results , the underwriters will be re-
sponsible
for the further
mischief
and damage so
occa-
sioned.
The relation
of cause
and
effect
cannot , indeed ,
always be accurately ascertained ; yet if, in the ordinary
course
of events , a certain result
usually follows from a
given cause , the immediate relation of one of these to the
other may , for
practical
purposes , be held to be estab-
lished , and the causa causans
may thus be singled out (k) .

Again , by the terms of the policy , the underwriters
are
usually made liable for salvage and for general average.
The term " salvage " is used to signify either what may
be recovered
from a wreck , or, as here , the compensation
allowed to
those persons by whose assistance a ship or
cargo
is saved from
danger
or
loss in
case
of
wreck ,
capture , or the like ().
General
average (originally the
proportion
of cattle-
labour due from
each tenant to his lord , from
averare, to
carry or draw , and afterwards
used to signify the propor-
tion paid by each merchant for his goods carried ( m ) ) , is
a
contribution
by the owners of the ship , freight , and goods
on board , in proportion to their respective interests , towards
any particular
loss or expense sustained for the general
safety of the ship and cargo , in order that the particular
sufferer may not in the
end be a greater loser than the
rest of the persons interested .
Thus , in the case of jet-
tison (n), or of cutting
away the ship's masts in a storm ,
or where salvage is paid to recaptors , or goods are given
as a compensation to pirates to save the rest, or an expense
is incurred in reclaiming
the ship , or defending
a suit in a
foreign
court of admiralty , and obtaining
her discharge
from
an unjust
capture or detention :-in these and the
like
cases , where any sacrifice
is deliberately
and volun-
tarily made, or any expense is fairly and bond fide incurred
to prevent a total loss , or some great disaster , such sacri-
fice
or
expense
is regarded
as
the
proper
subject of a
general
contribution
, and is to
be rateably borne by the
owners of the ship , freight , and cargo, so that the loss
may fall equally upon all , according to the maxim of the
civil law, nemo debet locupletari
alienâ jactura.
The
ap-
plication of this principle
was understood by the Rhodians ,
whose regulations
on the
subject were adopted into the
(7) Maud . & Poll . Merch . Shipp.,
2nd ed. 419.

of estimating
salvage are now mainly
regulated by stat . 17 & 18 Vict . c.

Roman law, and made an important
head in the Digest (o) .
The
claim
to general
average
does
not arise , unless the
loss was voluntarily
incurred by those on board , or having
the conduct of the business , and tended to , and was actu-
ally followed by, the preservation of the rest , or of some
part of the ship and cargo (p).
Petty or accustomed
averages
are such small
charges
as pilotage , towage, light money , beaconage
, anchorage,
quarantine ,
&c. , which , when
they
are incurred
in the
ordinary
course of the voyage , are regarded as
necessary
and ordinary
expenses
, and not as a loss within the terms
of the policy ; but if incurred for any extraordinary
pur-
pose in the voyage, as to provide
against an impending
danger , or in consequence
of the ship's
being driven
out
of her
course
by stress
of weather , are
deemed
general
average , for which the insurer will be liable (g).
Such being in brief the liabilities cast upon the under-
writer of a marine policy in the ordinary form , he engages
within such limits , and to the extent of its real or agreed
value , that the ship or cargo insured
shall arrive safely at
its destination , and undertakes , on the happening
of a
certain
contingency , to make good the loss .
Such loss
may be partial or total , there being three
classes of cases
in which total loss may occur : the first is where the ship
absolutely
sinks , and is , in
fact , lost ; the second , where
the ship itself may not
be , in fact , totally
lost , but may
be
unable
to
continue
her
voyage,
being
injured
past
repair ; and the third , where the ship can be repaired , but
the expense of repair will be so considerable , that after the
repairs have been
effected
the vessel will fetch

market
than the sum expended in repairing
her ;
a case
falling within this last class is one of what is termed con-
structive total loss , and there notice of abandonment should
be given by the insured (r). Where , moreover , the subject-
matter of the insurance
is not actually
annihilated , the
assured claiming
as for a total
loss must give up to the
underwriters
all the remains of the
property
recovered ,
together
with all
benefit
and
advantage
belonging
or
incident to it (s).
A policy of marine insurance may contain express , or may
give rise to implied warranties , non-fulfilment
of which by
the assured will discharge the underwriter from liability ; a
warranty
differing
from a representation
dehors the policy
in this respect , that it must be strictly
complied with .
A
warranty
is a condition or contingency
; unless it be per-
formed there is no contract .
Nor does it signify for what
purpose the warranty was introduced , for being introduced
the contract does not exist
unless it is literally complied
with (t) . A collateral representation , if false in a material
point , may indeed avoid the policy
; if in a point imma-
terial , it can rarely suffice to evidence
fraud ,
and will
not in the absence
of fraud vitiate the policy (u) .
As showing the nature of an implied
warranty , the fol-
lowing instance
must
suffice :
a voyage policy
may be
effected
on a ship prior
to her leaving
port , or when

tually at

is contained

warranty

she had been seaworthy for the voyage when it commenced ,
if the insurance were on a vessel then at sea , that is to say ,
there is in such
case
a warranty of seaworthiness at the
commencement of the risk (x) .
The ground on which the
implication
of a warranty of seaworthiness rests is this .
The insurer is entitled to expect that
the
shipowner will
do all that it behoves
a careful and conscientious
man to
do to secure the safety of the
crew who
are
to
navigate
the vessel , and of the merchant's goods which are to be con-
veyed in it, so that the risk covered
by the insurance shall
be limited
to those perils incidental
to navigation , against
which the care and skill of man cannot provide .
This doc-
trine is, however , flexible , and capable of accommodating
itself to particular
states of facts , so that if an insurer , with
full knowledge of facts , agrees
to insure a vessel incapable
from her size or construction
of being brought up to the
ordinary standard
of seaworthiness , the implied
warranty
will be taken to be limited
to the capacity of the vessel ,
and will be satisfied if she is made as seaworthy as she is
capable of being made (y).
A policy of insurance , as we have
seen
(≈) , is a contract
of indemnity , subject to this qualification , that the parties
may agree beforehand in estimating the value of the sub-
ject assured, by way of liquidated
damages (a).
Such
an
insurance is essentially a speculative contract .
The special
facts upon which the contingent
chances
are to
be com-
puted lie most
commonly within
the
knowledge
of the
assured only ; the underwriter
trusts to his representation ,
and proceeds in confidence that the assured does not keep
back
any circumstance within his
knowledge
to mislead
the underwriter
into a belief that the
circumstance

(x) By the law of England , in a
time policy effected on a ship

at

condi-
tion

is intended

not exist , and to induce him to estimate the risk
as if it
did not exist .
The keeping
back
such circumstance
is a
fraud , which vitiates
the policy .
Nay, even though
the
suppression should happen through
mistake , without any
fraudulent
intention , still the underwriter
is deceived
, and
the policy may be avoided, the reason being that the risk
in such case run is really different
from the risk under-
stood and intended to be run at the time of the agreement .
And the policy would equally be void as against the under-
writer if he concealed
, as if he insured a ship on her voyage
which he privately
knew to have arrived , in which
case an
action
would
lie against him to recover back
the pre-
mium (b).
No proposition , it has been judicially remarked , is better
established
than
this , viz . , that
the party proposing
the
insurance
is bound
to
communicate
to the
insurer
all
matters which will enable him to determine the extent of
the risk against which he is to guarantee the assured ; if,
indeed ,
matters
are
common to the knowledge
of both
parties , such matters
need not
be communicated
;
and
when a fact is one of public notoriety , as of war , or where
it is one which
is matter of inference , and the
materials
for informing the judgment of the underwriter
are common
to both , the party proposing the insurance is not bound to
communicate that which he is fully warranted in assuming
the underwriter
already knows .
Short of this , however ,
the
party
proposing
the
insurance
is
bound
to
make
known to the insurer whatever
is
necessary
and essential
to enable him to
determine
what
is the extent of the
risk against which
he undertakes
to insure .
Though , if
the insurer
choose
to neglect
the
information
which
he
receives, it is his own fault, provided
sufficient
informa-
tion , so far as the assured is concerned
, has been placed at
his disposal (c).

The inducements
to fraud
on the part of the
assured
were to some extent diminished
by the stat . 19 Geo . 2 , c .
37, before the passing of which
a practice
had obtained
of insuring
large
sums without
having
any property
on
board ,
which
were
called
insurances , " interest
or
no
interest ;" this
was
a
species
of gaming , without any
advantage to commerce , such policies being
denominated
wagering policies
: it was therefore enacted
by sec . 1 of the
above statute that all insurances , interest
or no interest ,
or without further
proof of interest than the policy itself,
or by way of gaming
or wagering , or without
benefit of
salvage to the
insurer , shall
(with
certain exceptions ) be
totally null and void ; but this
provision
does
not extend
to
foreign
ships .
Reinsurances
which
were prohibited
by a repealed (d) section
of the
above
statute are now
legal (e).
A policy of insurance
against
loss by fire is a contract
of indemnity within the statute
14 Geo . 3 , c . 48 (ƒ) , by
which the company insuring
undertakes to make good the
loss by a money payment
not exceeding the

sustained
damage.
Upon the

the principles
which
govern it, however ,
are very
simple :
any
material
misdescription
of the

or fraud
on the part of the
assured
,

Life
insurance
is made available for effecting
any of Life insur-
various useful
objects , such as making
a settlement upon
marriage
or afterwards
insuring a provision
for wife
and
children .
So , too, in the case of a loan , if the chance of
re-payment depends upon the borrower's
life, it is usual
(besides the ordinary rate of interest ) for the borrower to
have his life insured
till the time of re-payment ;
for
which he is loaded with an additional
premium , suited to
his age and constitution .
Thus , if Sempronius
has only
an annuity for his life, and would
borrow
1007.
of Titius
for a year ; the inconvenience
and general hazard
of this
loan , we have seen (k) , are equivalent to 57. , which might,
therefore , be the rate of interest : but there is also a special
hazard in this
case ;
for if Sempronius
dies within the
year , Titius may lose the whole of his
1007.
Suppose this
chance to be as one to ten : it will follow that the extra-
ordinary hazard is worth
107. more , and therefore that the
reasonable rate of interest in this
case would be fifteen
per cent .
Sempronius , therefore , gives Titius , the lender ,
51. by way of interest , and applies
to an insurance
com-
pany to indemnify Titius against the extraordinary
hazard
incurred , paying
them the other
10l . per
annum for
so
doing .
And in this manner
may any particular
hazard
be
provided
against .
But ,
in
order
to
prevent
these
insurances from
being
turned into a mischievous
kind of
gaming , it was enacted by the statute 14 Geo. 3 , c. 48 (1),
that no insurance
shall
be made on any life wherein the
party
insured
has
no
interest
;
that in all
policies the
name of such interested party shall be inserted ; and that
nothing
more shall be
recovered
thereon than the amount
of the interest of the insured (m).

JURISDICTION

SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
As
well
policies
of insurance
against
fire
as
those
against
sea risks
are properly
contracts of indemnity , the
insurer
engaging
to make good within
certain
limited
amounts losses sustained by the assured in their buildings
,
ships , and goods .
The contract of life assurance differs
however from the two preceding
contracts in this respect,
that it is a mere contract
to pay a sum of money on the
death of a person in consideration of a certain
sum paid
down , or of the due payment of a certain annuity for his
life, the
amount of the annuity
being
calculated
in the
first instance
according to the probable
duration
of the
life, and when
once
fixed being
constant
and invariable .
This species of insurance , although formerly
regarded as a
contract of indemnity
(0) , is not really such ( p) .
It has recently
been enacted
that any person
or cor-
poration

by assignment
or other derivative title
to a policy of life assurance

action brought the right in equity to receive
and the right
to give an effectual discharge to the assurance company

by a tradesman to
whom
he was indebted .
Mr. Pitt
died
insolvent
before
the
term
of
insurance
had expired .
A grant
of
money was made
by
parliament
to
defray his debts , and
out
of this
grant
the plaintiff's
claim
was
li-
quidated
.
It
was
held
that
the
insured
could not recover upon the
policy
.
"
This

,"
said Lord
Ellenborough
,
"

;
and being
so
found-

it

,
of course
,
that
if
be-
fore the

was
brought
,
the

first supposed

Such
a
policy
being
founded
upon
the

1. Bailment.
kinds of contracts
and agreements about which specific
knowledge should be had .
1. Bailment , from
the French word bailler , to deliver ,
is a delivery of a thing in trust for some special object or
purpose , and upon an undertaking
express or implied
to
conform to the object or purpose of the trust ; as if cloth
be delivered , or (in our legal dialect ) bailed , to a tailor
to
make a suit of clothes, he has it upon an implied
contract
to render it again when made, and that in a workmanlike
manner .
If goods be delivered
to
a common carrier , to
convey from Oxford to London , he is under
a contract in
law to carry them to the person
appointed .
If goods be
delivered by a guest to an inn-keeper , the inn-keeper is
bound to keep them
safely , and restore them
when his
guest leaves the house . If a man takes in cattle to graze
and depasture on his land , which the law calls agistment ,
he takes them upon
an implied
contract
to return
them
on demand to the owner .
If a pawnbroker
receives
plate
or jewels as a pledge , or security , for the
re -payment of
money lent
thereon
at a day certain , he has them
upon
an express
contract
or condition
to restore them , if the
pledgor performs his part by redeeming them . If a land-
lord distrains
goods for rent , or a parish officer for taxes,
these for a time are
only
a pledge in the hands of the
distrainor , who is bound by an implied
contract in law to
restore them on payment of the debt and
expenses
before
the time of sale ;
or , when sold , to render back the over-
plus . If a man delivers anything
to his friend to keep for
him, the receiver is bound to restore it on demand . If a
man
hires
or borrows
a horse for a month , he has the
possession and a qualified
property
therein
during that
period ; on the expiration of which
his qualified
property
determines , and
the
owner
becomes
(in
case of hiring)
entitled
to the
possession of the horse
and also
to the
price for which the horse was hired .
In each
of these instances
there is a special qualified
property in the thing bailed transferred from the bailor to


BREACHES
OF CONTRACT .
225
:
the bailee , together
with the
possession.
It is not
an
absolute
property ,
because
of the
bailee's
contract for
restitution
the bailor
having
still left in him the right
to a chose in action , grounded
upon such contract .
And ,
on account of this qualified
property of the bailee in the
thing bailed , he (as well as the bailor ) may maintain
an
action against one who injures or takes away such a chattel .
The tailor , the carrier , the inn-keeper , the agisting farmer ,
the pawnbroker , the distrainor , and the
general bailee ,
may each of them vindicate , in his own right , this
his
possessory interest , against
a stranger
or third
person .
For , being responsible to the bailor , if the goods are lost
or damaged by his default , or if he do not deliver up the
chattel on lawful demand , it is therefore reasonable that
he (the bailee ) should have a right of action
against any
other person who may have purloined
or injured them , in
order that he may always be ready to answer the call of
the bailor (x).
According
to Lord Holt (y) there
are six sorts of bail-
ments :-(1) A bare naked
bailment of goods , delivered
by one man to another , to keep for the use of the bailor ;
this was called by the civilians
depositum
(z) .
(2) When
goods or chattels are lent to a friend gratis , to be used by
him, and this is called
commodatum
, because
the thing is
to be restored in specie .
(3) When goods are left with the
bailee , to be used by him for hire , this . is called locatio et
conductio , the lender
being the
locator , and the borrower
the conductor .
(4) When goods or chattels are delivered
to another as a pawn , to be a security to him for money
borrowed of him by the bailor , and this is called vadium,
a pawn ,
or pledge .
(5) Locatio
operis faciendi, when
goods or chattels are delivered to be carried , or something
is to be done about them for a reward , to be paid by the
person who delivers them to the bailee , who is to do the

thing about them .
(6) Mandatum , when there
is
a de-

to somebody , who is to carry
them , or do something
about them gratis , without
any
reward for such his work or carriage .
The
above celebrated
classification
of bailments
has
been much criticised
and found fault with, and for prac-
tical
purposes
may be
greatly
simplified .
Inasmuch ,
however , as the liability of a bailee must
be determined
by reference to the degree of care which he has exercised
in regard to the subject -matter of the bailment , a tolerably
precise meaning
should
at
once
be assigned
to certain
terms which are used in treating of the law of bailment .
Let
us designate
the
degrees
of diligence
as
slight ,
ordinary ,
and extraordinary ,
the
degrees
of negligence
corresponding
thereto
will then
be
respectively
gross ,
ordinary , and slight.
Common or ordinary diligence being
defined as that degree of diligence which
men in general
exert in respect to their
own affairs-that common pru-
dence which men of business and heads of families usually
exhibit
in conducting
matters
which
interest
them (a),
less than this
degree
of care will
constitute
slight, and
more than this will constitute
extraordinary
diligence ;
and the corresponding
degrees
of negligence will therefore
be known
or ascertainable .
Gross
negligence
will , ac-
cording
to this
scale , be negligence
greater
than
that
evidenced by the absence
of ordinary
care-of that degree
of care which
a man possessed of common prudence ought
to take ;
and ,
after
a similar fashion , the meaning of
slight negligence may be made apparent .
Regard
being
had
to the
preceding
paragraph , three
leading
classes of bailments may be thus characterized :-:-
1st. Where the trust is exclusively for the benefit of
the bailor (b).
Here slight diligence
only in regard
to
the thing bailed is required from
the bailee , unless he be
possessed
of special
skill
or
knowledge

relation

227
it (c) ; and gross negligence
alone will , except in the case
of a skilled
bailee , entail liability .
2ndly. Where the trust is exclusively
for the benefit of
the
bailee .
Here
extraordinary
care in regard
to the
chattel bailed is required from the bailee , who may even
be liable for the negligence
of his
servant , without any
consideration of personal negligence in hiring or keeping
him . If the bailee of a horse , which has been gratuitously
lent him, put it in his stable , and the horse be stolen , the
bailee shall
not be answerable .
But if he or his servant
leave the stable door open , and a thief steals the horse ,
the bailee will be chargeable by reason of his neglect and
laches (d).
3rdly . Where the trust is for the mutual benefit of both
parties to the bailment
; and here the degree of care
or
diligence required from the bailee is intermediate
between
slight and extraordinary .
This is by far the most impor-
tant class of bailments , and in connexion with it must be
noticed the doctrine of our law respecting lien .
Lien is
a right , exerciseable in given
cases
over the
chattel
property of another , to retain
such chattel until
some charge attaching
to and in respect of it has been
satisfied (e).
Every bailee for hire has a lien
on the subject -matter
of the bailment , for compensation
due to him in respect
of his work and labour
bestowed upon it ; and therefore
he is not bound , unless it be otherwise
specially
agreed ,
to restore the thing bailed until that
compensation
has
been paid him (ƒ).
A tailor who has made clothes out of
cloth
sent to him by a customer , is
not
in strictness
bound to deliver them to his employer until paid for the
work and labour bestowed on them by his direction .
Nor
is a jeweller who has received a gem to set, or a seal to

engrave , bound
to restore it until his
charges for work
bestowed upon it have been liquidated .
In either of these
cases
the lien is designated
as specific , i.e. , the right is
co - extensive merely with the claim in respect of the work
and labour bestowed upon the thing in question ; it could
not be asserted in regard to other
debts
or other claims
which
might have
accrued to the bailee
as against the
bailor .
Such a right of specific lien is recognised by our
law as available in all trades , and under very dissimilar
circumstances ;
whereas
to support
a general lien ,
¿.e.
a
right to detain
the thing
bailed in respect of all
out-
standing
antecedent claims , which
is an " encroachment
on the
common law,"
evidence
of usage
to that
effect
in the particular
trade or profession
must be given (g),
or at all events
the question whether
such a general right
of lien
exists in
the
particular
case
must
have been
affirmatively
settled .
The right of lien
is clearly founded
on
possession , and
if, after the lien has attached , the party
claiming
it, or
entitled to claim it, once part with the possession of the
goods, the right of lien upon them will be gone (h) .
This
particular
remedy , moreover , must be enforced by the act
of the person claiming it ;
our
common law aids
him
merely by recognizing
his right, but declines to give him
the costs incurred
in enforcing
it , or to compensate him
for damages , pecuniary or otherwise , which
he may have
sustained whilst enforcing it (2).
Bailment
Within the last of the three leading classes of bailments
previously
mentioned , is included
the bailment of goods
to a common carrier . A common carrier is one who holds
himself out to the public as undertaking
to convey the
goods of applicants from place to place. If a man profess
to be
carrier , the law creates
for him
a duty to receive

229
goods brought
to him for carriage ,
so
that
the
carrier
may incur liability for refusing to receive them (k).
The
common law duty thus imposed on the carrier may , how-
ever, in many respects , be regulated according to his will ;
for he may choose the kind of conveyance to be used, the
times for transit , the mode of delivery , the articles which
alone he will undertake to carry , what price he will charge
for carriage , when he will be paid ; moreover , the duty to
receive is always limited by the capability
to carry (1).
Further , according
to our
customary
law,
a common
carrier is an insurer of the goods entrusted to him, that is
to say , he is bound
to deliver
them safely , except when
prevented from doing so by the act of God (m) , or of the
king's
enemies
;
he
is
bound
also to
deliver
within a
reasonable time (n).
The policy of our law in thus
holding
that a carrier
ensures is based
on these
considerations .
Land carriers ,
it was thought by our ancestors , not without reason, might
easily combine with thieves to pilfer the goods committed
to their charge , and might effect
this in so clandestine a
manner as to evade detection .
When goods are delivered
to a carrier , they are usually no longer
under the
eye of
their
owner ; he seldom follows
them himself, or sends
any agent with them to the place of their destination . If

they should be lost or damaged , even by the grossest neg-
ligence of the carrier
or his
servants , or should be stolen
by them or by others in collusion with them , the
owner
would
most
likely
be
unable
to
prove
either
of these
causes of loss , for his witnesses must ex necessitate be the
carrier's
servants , who , not fearing
contradiction , would
excuse their masters and themselves (o) .
Such
was the reason for
imposing
on a carrier the
peculiar
liability
of an insurer .
To prevent litigation ,
collusion , and the necessity of investigating
facts which
could
not
satisfactorily
be unravelled , the law presumed
against the carrier , unless he showed that the injury com-
plained of was done by the king's enemies
, or was such as
could not have happened by the intervention
of man .
The
doctrines
of our
common
law affecting
carriers
mainly rested on notions of expediency and on a desire
to protect
traders , who
are
more vitally interested
than
others in having
protection
extended , by stringent
rules
and enactments , to goods and merchandise
in
transitu .
Our courts , nevertheless , apply to mercantile transactions ,
when occasion requires , their
own rules
and maxims , in
order to do substantial justice between parties .
Therefore ,
a carrier , although
an insurer , is not liable for damage
arising
from
any inherent
defect in goods
delivered
to
him for
conveyance
,
or
from
their
being
improperly
packed , or from
their
being of a perishable
nature , and

himself been guilty of negligence , to sue the carrier
for
damage thence resulting .
The duty of a carrier to deliver goods safely attaches in
general upon the assumption
that he has had the oppor-
tunity of securing
to himself remuneration
adequate
to
the risk cast upon him.
If the
carrier
has not had that
opportunity ,
or if circumstances
make
such
protection
reasonable , he may at common law, by a special acceptance
,
limit and restrict his responsibility (q) .

carriers

c.
68 ) ,
to affix
in their
offices
and
receiving
houses , accordingly
rejected responsibility , unless the con-
ditions
of insurance of goods thereby stipulated for were
complied
with :
these notices constituted special accept-
ances
of goods , and imposed
a limit to liability by the
Iwill of the
carrier .
Where
the
customer knew of the
notice , and did not offer, and the carrier
did not ask for ,
a premium , the carrier was protected by his notice .
notice , however , was held insufficient
to protect the carrier
if he were proved to have been guilty of gross negligence
-an expression to which it was found difficult to affix a
precise meaning .
Damage done to the article
entrusted
to the carrier for conveyance
, or the loss of such article ,
was held to afford
some
evidence of negligence , and the
line between
negligence
and
gross
negligence was ill-
defined (r) .

thrown by the
current
of judicial
decisions
upon
the
carrier ; and the legislature
interposed , and by the 11 Geo.
4 &
1 Will. 4, c. 68 , granted to land
carriers
reasonable
protection in respect of the articles (s) specified in sect . 1
of that statute , unless the customers insure .
As to the articles there enumerated , when exceeding in
value 10 %. , the statute provides that notices may be fixed
up in the carrier's
office
or receiving
house, which will
bind the customer , without proof of their having come to
his knowledge , provided
sundry regulations
contained in
the act are duly conformed
to.
The mode of proceeding
under
the
Carrier's
Act is this :-the
customer
should
tender to the carrier the article
to
be carried and declare
its
value , and
the
carrier
who
acquires
a right
to an
increased rate of charge for valuable
articles , by reason
of being
an insurer , should
make
that charge , and the
customer should either pay it, and so be protected against
loss , or refuse to pay it ;
and
then the
carrier , though
bound to carry , would
not , in case of loss , be liable (t).
If a carrier , when the value of the goods
tendered for
carriage has been declared , omits to demand the increased
rate of charge specified in his notice , he will still be liable
for loss of the goods , although
the higher
rate of charge
be not paid (u).
In regard to articles
not enumerated in sect . 1 of the
Carriers ' Act , all notices , such as carriers had been accus-
tomed to put up in their
offices , and just now alluded
to ,
are by sect. 4 invalidated .

still empowered to restrict
his liability by a special con-
tract (which is the statutory term ) or agreement between
his customer and himself, such agreement being evidenced
either by notice acquiesced in , or document signed , by the
customer .
The
case of loss
caused
by the felonious
act of the
carrier's
servants is , by sect. 8, taken
altogether
out of
the operation of the statute (x).
The
next
important
enactment
affecting
carriers ,
is
" The Railway and Canal
Traffic Act " (17 & 18 Vict . c.
31 ) ; under
sect . 2 of which
a company , within the pur-
view of the act (y) , is required
to afford " all reasonable
facilities " for the receiving , forwarding , and delivering of
traffic ;
and
such
companies
are precluded
from giving
any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage " to
any person ,
or from subjecting
him, or any
particular
description of traffic , to " undue or unreasonable prejudice
or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever ." Under
sect . 3 ,
a company infringing these provisions of the act may be
restrained from continuing
to do so by injunction .
66
Before the powers conferred
by these
two sections are
put in motion , the court must be satisfied that some undue
preference is being
shown to an individual
, or that some
substantial
damage is being done or inconvenience caused
to the public (z ) ; and they must further
be satisfied that
the complaint
is bonâ fide
made on behalf of the public ,
for whose benefit-not for that of individuals -the statute
must be taken to have been passed (a).

A railway company , indeed , may be entitled

vided in doing so they act bond fide with regard

or canal and partly
by sea , a condition exempting
the company from liability
for any loss or damage which may arise during the car-

the receipt or freight
note given by the company for the animals , luggage , or

valid
as
part of the
contract
between
the
consignor
and
the
company , in
like manner
as if the
company had signed and delivered to the consignor a bill
of lading
containing
such condition (f).
And where
a
railway
company works
steam vessels in connection with
its land traffic , the provisions of the stat. 17 &
18 Vict .
c. 31 , so far as applicable , have been , by the
above

A carrier's
liability in respect of goods committed to
his charge ordinarily
continues
until the
delivery of the
goods either is
completed
or
has
been waived by the
owner .
As soon as the goods have reached their
desti-
nation , and no further
duty remains
to be discharged by
the
carrier
in
reference
to them , his
liability
as
such
ceases ( ) .
He may , however , thereupon
assume
another
character , and with it another liability .

assume the character of warehouseman , and then it may
be matter of much nicety (supposing the goods entrusted
to him to be lost or damaged) to decide in which character
the bailee is to be held answerable for them : and this
question is one of importance , forasmuch as damages
may
on one view of the case be recoverable , which would
not
be so on the other .
Thus , a common carrier is liable for
loss by fire , unless
caused
by the act of God , whereas a
warehouseman
is not liable
for loss by fire unless he has
been guilty of negligence (i).
Again , a carrier , in consideration
of the
compensation
paid to him as such , may undertake
to act also as ware-
houseman for a reasonable time , should the goods for so
long be allowed
to remain in his custody .
On this state
of facts , the remuneration
for carrying
is meant to cover
the risk of warehousing ; also, if the goods be negligently
lost
whilst
warehoused , the liability of the
carrier
and
warehouseman will be that which
attaches
to a bailee for
hire , not that
which
attaches to a gratuitous
bailee ( ) .
The liability of a warehouseman ordinarily
begins as soon
as the
goods arrive
at the warehouse and the crane is
applied to raise them into it.
It ends when the goods are
delivered to the owner or his order () .
Inasmuch
as a railway
company sometimes establishes
a line of steamers
plying in connection with its trains , a
loss of goods
delivered
to the company for
conveyance
might
occur whilst such goods were in the hands of the
company as wharfingers , not
as carriers or as warehouse-
men .
The liability of a wharfinger
is that of a depositary
for hire ; he must extend ordinary or reasonable diligence
to the thing bailed : and the principal
difficulty
here may
be in determining
when the custody of the goods by the
company in the capacity of wharfingers
begins
and when
it terminates .
Goods are often in a wharfinger's
posses-

sion with a view to being put on board ship for exportation ,
and in this case a delivery of the goods into the possession
,
actual or constructive , of the owners of the ship will dis-
charge the wharfinger
from liability (m) .
And even where
the goods sustained damage whilst actually in the custody
of the wharfinger
and by his negligence , he may possibly
succeed
in showing
that
they were then in his
custody
gratuitously , and
that he has not
been
guilty of gross
negligence , in respect of which alone a gratuitous
bailee
is answerable (n).
The old customary
law of England
which
applies
to
rierg of pas- bona
et catalla , is not altogether
applicable to the persons
of passengers conveyed by a land
carrier , nor
do the
statutory provisions which have latterly been
under
our
notice apply to them .
When a passenger has
paid for
and received his ticket
at the booking
office (o) of a rail-
way company for conveyance
from one terminus to another ,
this ticket indicates in some sort the journey which the
passenger is to take ;
so that we have thus
presented to
us the essential elements of a contract , executed
on the
one side by payment of the fare , and executory on the other
between the passenger and the
company .
We have the
consideration
in the
shape of money moving
from the
passenger , and an undertaking
by the company to convey
him, of which the extent
and limits are set forth more or
less precisely on the ticket .
When this contract has been
entered into , the company do not , as does a common carrier
of goods , insure
against all injuries
unless caused by the
act of God or by public
enemies ; they undertake
merely
that
they
and their agents
are possessed
of competent
skill , and that they will use all due care and diligence in
the performance of their
duty .

him will consequently be to carry safely those whom
he
receives as passengers so far
as human
care and foresight
will avail (q).
But although
a carrier of passengers
does
not insure
their safety, it may be almost
superfluous to observe
that
for
negligence
causing
personal
hurt
to
a
passenger ,
whether in transitu ,
at the
terminus , or
at
a
roadside
station , a railway
company will , in the
absence
of mis-
conduct or contributory
negligence by the passenger him-
self,
be
clearly
responsible (r).
A passenger
carrier ,
moreover, holding
himself out
as such, seems
bound to
carry , so far as his
means
of accommodation
may avail ,
any person
being in a fit
state to associate with his
fellows and duly tendering
his money for
conveyance
(s).
And an obligation
is imposed
on a railway
company , by
the issue of a passenger ticket for
a certain
train, to
forward the passenger by that
particular
train
without
undue delay or retardation .
Circumstances
may doubtless
qualify this obligation , for although
on the one hand the
company could not exonerate themselves from it by arbi-
trarily limiting
the number
of carriages
composing the
train in question , yet on the other hand , out of regard to
safety, they might well be justified in declining
to attach
additional
carriages to the engine , or to run extra trains
for the accommodation of those who had bought tickets ;
though in this
case the
passage -money received might
have to be refunded by the company on demand .

The mere expression of an opinion to that effect

not suffice (t).
And

we
must
remember
that
railway
companies
almost
invariably
protect
themselves

any irregularity in
their

by inserting
notices in their time-

of the company may further

A passenger who has conformed to the regulations of a

Where ,
as
now
frequently
happens , a railway
com-
pany possesses
at
its
principal
termini
and
stations
hotels for the accommodation
of
passengers
,
liabilities
may attach to such a company in the character of inn-
keepers
differing
essentially from those which
attach to
them as carriers .
An
innkeeper
is at common
law bound
to
receive
a
guest , and to find for him reasonable and proper accom-
modation (c) .
He is bound , also, to take due care of the
goods and baggage of his guest deposited in his house,
and to keep them
day and night without
abstraction
or
loss .
The innkeeper
is accordingly liable for the felonious
taking of goods placed in his custody as innkeeper , and is
responsible for the
acts of his servants ;
indeed the pro-
perty of a guest is , by legal implication , in the actual care
and custody of the innkeeper , who by custom is responsible
for its safety-at all
events
with some rare exceptions ,
such as the act of God or the king's enemies (d).
And the
innkeeper is bound
in law to
keep the property of his
guest
safe , without
any stealing
or purloining
(e), pro-
vided it be within the inn or its appurtenances ; for if a
man comes
to a common inn , and delivers
his horse to
the ostler , directing
that it be put to pasture , which
is
done, and the horse is stolen , the innkeeper will not be
liable , because
he is answerable for nothing that is out of
his inn, but for such things only as are within it (ƒ) . The
innkeeper would not , however , at common law, be liable for

loss of goods placed in a room of which his guest had the
special charge , or where such loss
was occasioned
by the
guest's own negligence (ƒ) .
The responsibility
imposed upon an innkeeper at common
law has been much diminished
by the stat . 26 & 27 Vict.
c. 41 , reciting
that "it is expedient to amend the law con-
cerning the liability of innkeepers in respect of the goods
of their guests ." It enacts as follows-That no innkeeper
shall be liable to make good to his guest any loss of or
injury to goods or property
brought
to his inn (g) (not
being a horse or other live animal , or any gear appertain-
ing thereto , or any carriage ) to a greater amount than the
sum of 30 %. , except- ( 1 .) Where
such goods or property
have been stolen , lost , or injured
through
the wilful act,
default , or neglect of the innkeeper or any servant in his
employ ; or (2. ) Where
such goods or property have been
deposited
expressly for
safe custody with the innkeeper ,
provided
that in the
case of such deposit the innkeeper
may , if he think
fit
,
require
,
as
a
condition
of
his liability
,
that such goods
or
property shall
be deposited

land and partly by water , and the loss has occurred during
the transit by land (j) , it
does
not apply to the convey-
ance
of goods in
a
sea -going
ship .
In this
case , ac-
cordingly , the parties
interested
must protect themselves
by mutual
stipulations , though
the legislature
has from
time to time interposed with a view to modifying their
arrangements .
The contract by which an entire ship , or some principal
part of it, is let to a merchant for the conveyance of goods
on a determined voyage to one or more places , is termed a
charter -party (k) , the charterer of the ship
causing it to
be laden wholly or in part with goods belonging
to other
persons ; in relation
to whom it seems
that he is to be
considered
as owner of the ship (/) .
Now, when goods
are put on board ship in pursuance of a charter -party , the
practice is that the master signs for them bills of lading ,
usually two or three in number , the charter-party being
the instrument
and
evidence
of the contract for convey-
ance , and the bill of lading
the
evidence
of the shipping
of the particular
merchandize
to be conveyed
(m ) .
This
latter
instrument
operates in
part
as
an acknowledg-
ment that the goods specified in it have been
shipped ,
and in part
operates
as an undertaking
that
such goods
shall
be delivered
at the distant
port
to the
consignee
or
his assigns ,
or
to the
order
of the
consignor , in
like
condition ,
subject
to certain
exceptions ,
as when
shipped (n).

The bill of lading is thus a symbol of the
property
referred to in it , and , as formerly
stated (o) , the vendee
and consignee of goods at a distant port may , by assign-
ing over this
instrument
to a bona fide transferee , defeat
the right of stoppage in transitu vested in the vendor in
the event of his (the vendee's) insolvency ; upon this rule ,
however , being engrafted
the qualification
that by indors-
ing over the bill of lading, the
vendor's right
may be
defeated.
The actual holder of an indorsed bill of lading
may
consequently , by
indorsement ,
transfer
a greater
right than he himself had ; that is to say, he may give
an indefeasible right in lieu of the defeasible title which
he himself
possessed (p).
This peculiar
property of a
bill of lading is derived from
its negotiable
quality , and
is limited
to the case where the person who transfers
the
right
is himself in possession of, and in a situation
to
transfer the instrument
(9) .

(p) Jenkyns v. Usborne, 7 M. &
Gr. 699.
(4) We read in a recent judgment
the
following
passage explanatory
of the text.
A bill of lading, in
the common
form , for the delivery
of goods to " order and assigns , " is
a negotiable
instrument
which , by
indorsement
and
delivery ,
passes
the
property
in the goods to the
indorsee ,
subject
only to the right
of an unpaid
vendor to stop them in
transitu .
The
indorsee may deprive
the vendor of this right by indorsing
the bill of lading
for valuable
con-
sideration , although
the goods are
not paid
for,
or bills
have
been
given
for the price
of them which
are certain to be dishonoured , pro-
vided
the indorsee
for
value
has
acted bond fide and without
notice .
Although a bill of lading
is a nego-
tiable instrument , it is so only as a
symbol
of the
goods named in it ;
and although
the
shipper may have
indorsed
in blank a bill
of lading
deliverable
to his
assigns , his right
is not
affected by an appropriation
of it without his authority ; and if
it be stolen from him or transferred
without his authority , a subsequent
bona fide transferee for value cannot
make title under it as against
the
shipper of the goods , for in the cases
put there could be no lawful assigns
of the shipper , and consequently the
bill of lading could
have
no exist-
ence as
a
negotiable
instrument
.

touched the right of stoppage in transitu
enjoyed by the
consignor of goods ; by its first section , however, there
is
vested in the indorsee of a bill of lading the right to
sue
and the liability to be sued upon it in like manner as if
the contract contained therein
had
been
made with him-
self(r) .
Moreover , by sect.
3 of the same statute , the
bill of lading in the hands of a consignee or indorsee for
value , representing goods to have been shipped on board a
vessel, is now conclusive
evidence of
such shipment
as
against
the master
or other person signing it, notwith-
standing
that such goods , or
some part
thereof , may not
have been so
shipped , unless the
holder
of the bill of
lading had actual notice on receiving
the
same that the
goods had not been in fact put on board ; and the master
or other person signing the bill may exonerate himself in
respect of such misrepresentation
by showing
that it was
caused
without
any default on his part , and wholly by the
fraud of the
shipper , or of the holder , or
some
person
under whom the holder claims (s) .
A bill of lading
signed by the captain of a ship is not
only
an acknowledgment
by him of the
receipt
of the
goods
mentioned
in it, it is also an
undertaking
that
such goods are
to be delivered , in like " good order and
condition ," at the distant port- subject , however , to these
important

God ,
the
queen's
enemies , fire , and all and every other dangers
and acci-
dents of the

of what
kind
and nature soever.
Within
one or other of these excep-
tions , therefore ,
or of any additional
exceptions which
may be
inserted , it
behoves
the shipowner , if charged
for loss of, or damage done to, the goods , to bring him-

such

has
been
limited ,
as
presently
mentioned .
Where an express contract has
been
entered
into for
the conveyance of a passenger on board a sea -going
ship ,
the rights of the parties will be governed by its
terms ,
interpreted by the usage of the particular
trade or voyage ;
and where the contract is not express , it may be evidenced
by such usage (u) .
By reason , however , of the impositions
practised upon passengers on board ship , and the hardships
to which they are often subjected , various
enactments (x)
have been made by the legislature
containing
provisions
calculated to promote their safety , health , personal comfort ,
and well -being .
Regard
being
had , however , to the provisions of Lord
Campbell's
Act (y) , and to the great pecuniary responsi-
bilities which
might attach to shipowners in case of loss ,
the statute law provides as follows :-
That the owners of any ship , whether British or foreign ,
shall not , where any of the following
events
occur without
their actual fault or privity—sc . , where loss of life
or
personal injury is caused to any person carried in such
ship , or where damage or loss is caused to any goods,
merchandize , or other things
whatsoever on board
such
ship- be answerable in damages to an aggregate amount
exceeding
157. per ton of the ship's

actual
fault or privity to any goods or merchandize
on board such
ship by reason of fire , or to any gold , silver , diamonds ,
watches , or precious stones
on board such ship by reason
of robbery or embezzlement
thereof , unless the owner or
shipper of the same has, at the time of shipment , inserted
in his bills of lading , or otherwise described in writing to
the master and owner of such ship the true nature
and
value of such articles , or beyond the value of the ship and
its freight , where , without
his actual fault or privity , any

to goods , merchandize , or other
things on board such ship (a).
We have
thus
considered in order
the
three
points
specified at page 154 as deserving
to be noticed in con-
nection with a simple contract , the last of these
having
been "the thing to be done or not to be
done."
In
treating , under this head , of various
species of contracts ,
an arrangement was adopted which
may have appeared
to
the
reader in
some
respects defective , contracts
having
been divided into :
( 1) , such
as are required
by statute
or
(2) by mercantile
usage to be in writing ;
and
(3) ,
other contracts (b).
Such a division of the subject , how-
ever , was adopted
on the ground
of
its
simplicity and
practical utility
,
rather than because
it
is
strictly
accurate
,
Some important
species
of
contracts
are
,
from their very
nature
,
almost
necessarily evidenced
by writing
;
and

others
,
which mainly fall under the particular
head hereto-
fore assigned
to
them
,
writing has
,
by positive enactment
,
in
this
or
that particular

.
Such dis-
crepancies
,
which
to
the logician may seem
objectionable
,
in truth
result
from the
combination

CHAPTER X.
JURISDICTION
OF
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
WRONGS
TO PERSONAL
PROPERTY .
In pursuance of the plan indicated at a former page (a),
we shall now enquire as to such wrongs
as directly or in-
directly
affect the rights
of property , and the remedies
which
our law has given to repair
or redress
them .
In
the present Chapter
we shall speak of wrongs to personal ,
and in the ensuing Chapter of wrongs to real property , in
accordance with our former
division
of property into per-
sonal
and
real (b) :
personal , which
consists
in
goods ,
money , and all other moveable chattels , and things there-
unto
incident
;
a
property
which
may
attend
a
man's
person wherever
he
goes ,
and
from
thence
receives
its
denomination
and real property , which
consists of such
things as are permanent , fixed , and immoveable ;
as lands ,
tenements , and hereditaments , which
are not annexed to
the person , nor
can be moved from the place in which
they subsist .
We may , however , in limine, observe
that torts
cognis-
able at law may arise under
circumstances
akin
to , or
identical
with , some which in the
pages immediately
pre-
ceding have been mentioned-fraud , negligence , or breach
of duty , when
causing damage, being usually remediable
by action .
Here , therefore , certain nice distinctions
must
be noticed —especially between warranty
and false repre-
sentation , and between negligence or breach of duty and
breach of contract .

JURISDICTION
OF SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
A contract , as formerly
stated , is
express
or implied .
A person who contracts as agent thereby impliedly under-
takes and warrants that he has authority
in that
capacity
to contract ; and should
he , in fact , have no such autho-
rity , he will be answerable according to the facts , i. e. , the
absence
or presence
of fraud , to an action of contract or of
tort , in which may be recovered
compensation for damages
resulting
as a direct consequence
in the ordinary course of
affairs from the alleged breach of contract or of faith (c) ;
indeed , it
holds
generally
true
that if A fraudulently
makes a representation which is false , and which he knows
to be false , to B-, meaning that B shall act upon it, and
B, believing it to be true , does act upon it, and so sustains
damage, B may have an action against A for the deceit
there being here such a conjunction of wrong and loss as
will entitle the injured party to redress
(d) ; and a principal
is clearly responsible for damage
caused
by the fraud
or
misrepresentation
of his general
agent , though difficulty
may occur in fixing the principal with responsibility
for
the fraud of a particular
agent (e).
Again , if the vendor
of an article , upon the sale, warrants it to be good , the
law annexes a tacit contract to this warranty , that if it be
not
so, he shall
make
compensation
to the
buyer in an
action
purely
ex contractu (f) ; whereas should

fraud in the transaction , an action on the case would lie
to recover damages
; ex. gr . , if the vendor , knowing the
goods to be unsound , used any
art to disguise them , he
would
be answerable .
Also , at common law, an action.
would lie for fraudulently
marking
iron with a stamp in
imitation
of the plaintiff's
stamp , and
selling
it under
pretence
that it was the
genuine
manufacture
of the
plaintiff (g) . And it has recently been
enacted (h) that the
vendor of an article bearing a trade mark shall be deemed
to warrant that such mark is genuine , and not wrongfully
used, unless the contrary
be expressed in writing signed
by or on
behalf of the vendor , and
delivered
to
and
accepted by the vendee ( ) .
Further , that where a person
sells a chattel bearing
upon it any indication
of
its
quan-
tity
,

,
or
weight
,
or
of
the place
in
which
it
was

shall be deemed
to
have been made with
a
warranty by
the vendor that no such
indication
was
in
any material
respect untrue
,
unless the contrary be expressed
in
manner
aforesaid

In cases such
as
have been specified
,
the form
of

appropriate

,
in
the
absence
of

legislative
intervention
,
be determined
by applying this test
:
was
there an ingredient
of
fraud and mala fides
in
the trans-
action under notice
,
or
is
there evidence merely
of
breach
of contract
?

length
,
when
it
is

there
an action

lies

252
JURISDICTION
OF
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
Negligence
may be defined to be the
omission
to do
something which a reasonable man , guided by those con-
siderations which ordinarily
regulate the conduct of human
affairs , would do , or the doing of something which a prudent
and reasonable
man would not do (1) .
Negligence
thus
defined when productive of damage to an individual is ac-
tionable , and proof of negligence may ,
as
appears from
instances adduced in the preceding Chapter , suffice in sup-
port of an action founded upon breach of contract .
Thus ,
there is in law an implied
contract with a common inn-
keeper, to
secure
his guest's
goods in his inn ; with a
common carrier , to be answerable for the goods he carries ;
with a common farrier , that he shoes a horse well , with-
out laming him ; with a common tailor , or other workman ,
that he performs his business in a workmanlike
manner ;
in which , if he fail, an action lies to recover damages for
such breach of undertaking .
And when a skilled labourer
or artist is employed to do work , there is on his part an
implied
warranty
that he has skill and is reasonably com-
petent for the
task which he
assumes
to perform .
The
public profession of an art is a representation
and under-
taking to all that the professor
possesses
the
requisite
ability and skill.
There
is
here an implied
contract
to
that effect , whereas a person not thus holding himself out
as an expert would incur liability
for want of reasonable
skill , only in virtue of an express contract that he pos-
sessed or would exercise it (m).
Negligence ,
indeed ,
is
comprised
within
the
more
general
expression breach of duty , in reference to which
it is established that where the law casts any duty upon a
person which he refuses or fails to perform , he is answerable
in an action to one whom his refusal or failure
damages ,
for one who undertakes
any office , employment , trust , or
duty ,
contracts with those who employ or trust
him , to

perform it with integrity , diligence , and skill (n) .
And , if
by his want of either of those qualities any damage accrues
to an individual
, such person has in general a remedy by
action .
A few instances will illustrate
this
matter .
If
an officer of the public
is guilty of neglect of duty , or
a palpable
breach of it, of non -feasance
or of mis -feas-
ance ; as , if the
sheriff
does
not
execute
a writ sent to
him ,
or if he wilfully
makes a false return
thereto ; in
both these cases the party aggrieved may have an action
against
the sheriff
for
damages
to
be
assessed
by
a
jury (o).
So
negligence
or
breach
of
duty
may , in
accordance with the above principle , be imputed
to the
trustees of works to the use of which the public on pay-
ment of tolls or
otherwise
are
entitled ,
as
well if such
trustees wilfully
omit to avail
themselves of means of
knowledge
respecting
the condition of the works
which
they
have in
charge
as if the
actual
existence of such
knowledge
be brought
home to them , and for
damage
resulting
from
their
neglect of duty , where established ,
they will in either case be liable ( p).
Circumstances
evidencing negligence or breach of duty
may be infinitely various (2 ) , sometimes giving rise indif-
ferently to an action of contract or of tort , and sometimes
to an action ex delicto only .

exemplifying
the
differences between breach of contract
and
negligence
or
breach of duty , the

for A. was guilty of wrongful non -repair , which
caused
damage, and the fall of the building did not arise from an
act of the lessee , but happened in obedience
merely to the
laws of nature .
In a case of this sort there is no contract
between A. and C. , but there is a breach of duty owing by
A. to C. , and for the damage thence resulting , an action
ex delicto
is held to be maintainable
by our law.
Again ,
A. is the
owner of premises bounded by a wall which
he
suffers to remain in a ruinous
and dangerous condition .
B. , lawfully passing
along
a highway
contiguous
to the
said
wall, sustains
hurt by its falling upon him.
B.
will have a right of action against A. to recover damages
compensatory for the hurt which has been done him (s).
Under these circumstances
there is to be found no sem-
blance of a contract , nor
any
connection
or privity be-
tween A. and B.;
the right of action
contains
in truth
exclusively
these elements- a general
breach of duty on
the part of A. , and damage suffered by B. in consequence
of such breach of duty .
We will in the next place enumerate and briefly
con-
sider the wrongs
that may be done to personal property
as well by unlawfully taking , detaining , or converting it ,
as by injuring or causing consequential damage to it.
The right of property in external things being originally
acquired by occupancy, and preserved and transferred by
grants ,
deeds ,
and wills , in continuation
of that

pancy ; it follows

I once
have gained a rightful possession of any goods or
chattels , either by a just occupancy or by a legal transfer ,
whoever by force dispossesses
me of them , is guilty of a
transgression
against the law of society , which
is a kind
of secondary law of nature .
For there must be an end of
all social commerce between man and man , unless private
possessions be secured from unjust invasion : and , if an
acquisition of goods by force were allowed to be a suffi-
cient
title , all property
would
soon
be confined
to the
most
strong ,
or the most
cunning
;
and the weak and
simple -minded part of mankind
(which is by far the most
numerous
division ) could never be secure of their posses-
sions .
The
wrongful
taking of goods being
thus
clearly
an
injury, the next
consideration is , what
remedy the law of
England has given
for it.
And this is by an action of
trespass,
technically
described
as
de
bonis
asportatis ,
wherein the plaintiff may recover, not the thing itself, but
only damages
for the loss of it (t).
detainer.
Detinue and replevin (which , being somewhat anomalous
Unlawful
in its nature , will be separately
treated of at the end of
this Chapter ) are the only
actions in which
the specific
possession of personal
chattels
is restored to the proper
owner .
For things
personal
are looked upon by the law
as of a nature so transitory
and perishable , that it is for
the most part impossible either to ascertain their identity ,
or to restore them in the same condition
as when they
came to the hands of the wrongful
possessor
.
And , since
it is a maxim that " lex neminem
cogit ad vana, seu impossi-
bilia ,"
our law therefore
contents itself in general with
restoring , not the thing itself, but a pecuniary
equivalent
to the
party
injured
; by giving him a satisfaction
in
damages.
Detinue lies for the illegal detention of another's goods ,
whether
the original
taking of them was lawful or other-

Conversion
wise .
As if I lend a man a horse ,
and he afterwards
refuses to restore it , this injury consists in the detaining ,
not in the original
taking , and the regular method for me
to recover possession is by action of detinue (u) ; in which
action it is necessary to ascertain
the thing detained , so
that it may be specifically known and recovered .
There-
fore
detinue
cannot be brought
for money , corn , or the
like ; for that cannot be known from other money or corn ;
unless it be in a bag or a sack , for then it may be distin-
guishably
marked . In order therefore to ground an action
of detinue , which
is only for the detaining , these points
are necessary (v) :
1. That the defendant has got into pos-
session
of and wrongfully detains the plaintiff's
goods ;
2. That the plaintiff had at the time of commencing the
action
a right
to the
immediate
possession of them ;
3.
That the plaintiff had a property in them (x) ;
and ,
4. That they be ascertained in point of identity .
Upon
this the jury , if they find for the plaintiff, assess the re-
spective values of the several parcels
detained , and also
damages for the detention .
And the judgment is condi-
tional ; that the plaintiff recover the said goods , or (if
they
cannot be had) their
respective
values ,
and
also
damages for detaining them (y).
A peculiar
power , ancillary
to the remedy by detinue ,
has recently been conferred upon a court of common law,
the power of compelling
restitution
of a chattel which has
been unlawfully detained-by distress , " till the defendant
render
such chattel ," or the power at the option of the
plaintiff of " causing to be made of the defendant's goods
the assessed
value of such chattel " (z) .
The action
of
trover
or conversion
originally lay for
recovery of damages
against
such person
as had
found
another's goods , and refused to deliver them on demand ,

but converted them to his own use ; from
which
finding
and converting it was called an action of trover and con-
version .
By a fiction of law, however , an action of trover
was at length
permitted
to be brought
against
any man
who
had in his possession by any means the
personal
goods of another ,
and wrongfully
sold
or
used
them
without the consent of the owner , or asserted dominion
over them
or refused to deliver
them
when
demanded .
And
although
the fact of a finding became immaterial ,
the plaintiff still suggested in his declaration that he had
lost such goods , and that the defendant found them : a
form which has been simplified
by the first Common Law
Procedure Act , s . 49 , which enjoins that " the statement
of losing and finding
and bailment
in actions for goods or
their
value " be omitted .
The
declaration in trover ac-
cordingly
now alleges that " the defendant
converted to
his own
use , or wrongfully deprived
the plaintiff of the
use and possession " of his goods .
To support this
action
the plaintiff must
show
a right of possession (a) , and a
right of property ;
he must
also give proof of a conver-
sion (6) by the defendant .
Any man may take the goods
of another into possession if he finds them ; but no finder
is allowed
thus
to acquire
a property
therein
as against
the
absolute
owner , and therefore he must
not
convert
them to his own
use , which
the law presumes him to do
if he refuses
to restore them to the
owner :
for
which
reason
such refusal
alone is prima facie evidence of a
conversion (c) .
A conversion
being
proved , the plaintiff

shows
that the

has yet such a property in it as will

Injury

tial.
may in this action recover
damages
equal to the value of
the thing converted .
As to the damage that may be done to things personal ,
consequen- while in the
possession of the
owner ,
as by hunting
a
man's
deer , shooting his dogs , poisoning
his cattle , or in
anywise
taking
from the value of any of his chattels , or
making
them in a worse condition
than
before, these are
wrongs
too
obvious to
need
explication . I have
only
therefore to mention the remedies given by the law to re-
dress them , which are in two shapes
; by action of tres-
pass , where the act is in itself immediately
injurious
to
another's
property , and by action on the
case , where the
act is in itself perhaps indifferent , and the injury only con-
sequential (d) , in either of which
suits
the plaintiff may
recover damages
in proportion to the injury which he proves
that he has sustained .
And it is not material whether the
damage be done by the defendant himself, or his servants.
by his direction ; for the action will lie against the master
as well as against the servant (e). And if a man keeps a dog
which
does mischief, by worrying
sheep , the owner
must
now answer for the
consequences
thereof ,
whether
he
knows of such evil habit or not , for "it shall not be neces-
sary for the party
seeking
such damages to show a pre-
vious
mischievous
propensity in such dog , or the owner's
knowledge of such previous propensity , or that the injury
was attributable
to neglect on the part of such owner " (ƒ) .
This statute does not however apply where hurt is caused
property in goods will , as against a
wrong -doer, entitle
the person
hav-
ing it to maintain
trover .

If the

of a

deals with the pledge in a

to a human
being by a ferocious animal , in which
case
the
scienter
must , where the animal is domesticated , be
proved , though not so if the animal
be feræ naturæ (g) .
And here is noticeable the diversity of remedies which
may sometimes present themselves for choice to one ag-
grieved , inasmuch
as a particular
ingredient
essential for
the maintenance of an action in one form, but
not at all
necessary
to the maintaining
of it in
another , may
at
pleasure be discarded and put out of sight
so as perchance
to affect the form of action to be adopted and the evidence
to be adduced on behalf of the plaintiff at the trial , and to
cause
a change in the mode of procedure .
If a man's
goods are taken
by
an
act of trespass , and are subse-
quently sold by the trespasser , and the proceeds of their
sale received by him, we have seen that an action of tres-
pass will lie for this injury against
the trespasser , and if
minded
thus
to
sue , the
complainant
will declare that
" the
defendant
seized and
took
his goods and carried
away the same and converted them to his own use."
The
gist of the complaint
when thus put forward obviously is
the forcible
and tortious
taking of the chattel , the pro-
perty of the plaintiff.
But in the
case
supposed it is
quite
open to him to waive the element of force , and to
sue in trover for the value of the goods , charging
merely
that the defendant converted them to his own use ; or the
plaintiff may bring his action in detinue , and complain of
the detention of his goods, and possibly by availing him-
self of this latter remedy may compel their restitution
(h) .
Further , the
plaintiff
might,
under
the
circumstances
supposed , maintain
an action for money received by the
defendant for his use .

appropriate for contesting the validity of a distress (though
it lies for the wrongful
taking of goods and chattels under
other circumstances (k) ) , the thing taken being redelivered
to the owner , upon his giving security to try the legality
of the distress , and to restore it if the right be adjudged
against him.
Formerly, when the party distrained
upon
intended to dispute the right of the distress , he had no
other
process
at the common law than by a writ of re-
plevin , replegiari facias (l) ; which issued out of chancery ,
commanding
the
sheriff
to
deliver
the
distress
to the
owner , and
afterwards
to do
justice in
respect of the
matter in dispute in his own
county
court .
This was,
however , a tedious method of proceeding , the
beasts
or
other goods being long detained
from the owner to his
great loss and damage (m) .
For which
reason
the statute
of Marlbridge
(n ) directed that
(without suing a writ out
of the
chancery ) the
sheriff
immediately , upon
plaint
to him made, should proceed to replevy the goods .
And ,
for the greater ease of the parties , it was further
provided
by statute
1 Ph . & M. c. 12 , that the sheriff should appoint
at least four deputies in each
county , for the purpose of
making
replevins
;
and upon
application
either
to the
sheriff
or one of his said deputies ,
security
was to be
given , in pursuance of the statute of Westm. 2 , 13 Edw .
1 , c. 2-1 . That
the party replevying
would pursue his
action against the distrainor , for which
purpose he put in
plegios de prosequendo
, or pledges to prosecute ; and , 2.
That if the right were
determined
against him , he would
return
the distress again , for which
purpose he was also
bound to find plegios de retorno habendo .
Besides these
pledges , the
sufficiency
of which
was discretionary
and
at the peril of the sheriff , the
statute
11
Geo . 2 , c. 19 ,
required that the officer , granting
a replevin
on a distress
for rent , should take a bond with two sureties in a sum of

double the value of the goods distrained , conditioned
to
prosecute the suit with effect and without
delay , and for
return of the goods ; which
bond was to be assigned to
the
avowant
or
person making
cognizance ,
on
request
made to the officer ; and, if forfeited , might
be sued upon
in the name of the
assignee .
The
sheriff , on receiving
such security , was immediately , by his officers, to
cause
the chattels taken in distress to
be restored into the pos-
session of the party distrained upon ; who was then bound
to bring his action of replevin with
a view to testing the
validity of the distress .
In this
action
the
distrainor
(the
defendant )
made
avowry ;
that
is ,
avowed
taking
the
distress ,
and
set
forth the reason of it, as for rent in arrear , damage done ,
or other cause
or else
he justified
in another's right as
his bailiff
or servant , in which
case he was said to make
cognizance ;
that
is , he
acknowledged
the
taking ,
but
insisted
that
such taking was legal , as he acted by the
command of one who had a right to distrain
; and on the
truth and legal
merits of this
avowry or cognizance the
cause
was
determined .
If it were determined
for the
plaintiff ;
viz . that
the
distress
was wrongfully
taken ;
he kept the goods which he had already got into his own
possession , and moreover
recovered
damages (o) .
But if
the defendant
prevailed
by the default
or nonsuit of the
plaintiff, he was
entitled
to a writ
de retorno
habendo ,
whereby the goods or chattels (which had been distrained
and then replevied ) were
returned again into his custody ;
to be sold or otherwise
disposed
of, as if no replevin
had
been made.
In virtue , however , of the statute 17 Car . 2 ,
c. 7 , if the plaintiff were nonsuit before issue joined , then
upon suggestion made on the record , or if judgment
were
given
against him on demurrer , then , without
any such
suggestion , the defendant might have had a writ to in-
quire into the value of the distress
by a jury , and might
have recovered the amount of it in damages, if less than

the arrear of rent ; or, if more , then so much as was equal
to such arrear , with costs : or, if the
nonsuit were after
issue joined , or if a verdict were had against
the plaintiff,
then the jury impanneled
to try the
cause were to assess
such arrears for the defendant : and if (in
any of these
cases ) the distress were
insufficient
to answer the arrears
distrained
for , the defendant might have taken a further
distress .
According to the policy of our ancient law, as the end of
a distress is to compel the party distrained upon to satisfy
the debt or duty owing from him, this end was thought to
be as well answered by the giving of sufficient sureties in
the manner
above mentioned as by retaining
the distress ,
which might frequently occasion great and needless
incon-
venience to the owner . The soundness of this policy is still
recognized , although
the practice connected with replevin
has, by recent statutes , been altered and improved .
Any
action of replevin
may now be brought
in the
county
court (p),
or
in
a superior
court ; the
powers
and responsibilities
of the sheriff with respect to replevin
bonds and replevins have ceased
; and the registrar of the
county court of the district in which
any distress subject
to replevin
may be taken is empowered to
approve of
replevin bonds , to grant
replevins , and to issue all neces-
sary process in relation thereto (9).
If the replevisor , or person replevying
goods , elect to
commence proceedings in a county court , he must do so
in the court of the
district in
which
the
distress
was
taken (r) , and must at the time of replevying
give security
conditioned to commence an action of replevin against the
distrainor within one month from the date of the security ,
to prosecute such action with effect and without delay , and
to make return of the goods, if a return

however , be thence removed by the defendant into a su-

JURISDICTION
OF
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
The action of replevin is tried in a summary way , either
with or without
a jury (3) , as other actions are tried in the
county court .
Where the distress is for rent , and the defendant
suc-
ceeds in the action , if the defendant require , the judge or
the jury will find the value of the goods
distrained , and if
the value be less than the amount of rent in arrear , judg-
ment will be given for the amount of such value , but if
the amount of the rent in arrear be less than the value so
found , judgment
will be given for the
amount of such
rent , and may be enforced in like manner
as any other
judgment
of the court (2).
Where the
distress
is for
damage-feasance , and
the
defendant
is entitled
to judgment
for
a return , if the
plaintiff
require ,
the judge
or
the jury will find the
amount of the damage sustained by the
defendant , and
judgment will be given in favour of the defendant , in the
alternative , for a return , or for the amount of the damage
so found (a).
An appeal lies in replevin from the county court where
the amount of rent
or damage exceeds
201. (b) , or where
the title comes
in question , or , by leave of the judge , in
any other case (c).
If the replevisor
elect to commence his action in
a
superior
court
(which in such
case will have
power to
hear and determine the
same) , he must , at the time of
replevying , give security , to be approved of by the regis-
trar, the condition
of such security being that the party
giving it will commence an action of replevin
against the
distrainor in the court specified within one week from the
date thereof , and will
prosecute such action with effect
and without delay ,
and unless judgment
therein
be
ob-
tained by default , will " prove before such superior court
that he had good ground for believing either that the title

WRONGS
TO REAL
PROPERTY
.
We have now to consider such wrongs
as affect that
species
of property which the
laws
of England
have
denominated real ; they are usually of a more substantial
and permanent nature than those which
affect the more
transitory
rights attaching to chattels personal .
Wrongs affecting
real rights
are principally ouster or
dispossession , trespass ,
and
nuisance .
These
we
shall
proceed to notice in the order indicated , and, as occasion
may
arise, will specify some other wrongs
not
exactly
referable to any
one of the foregoing
heads , yet , by no
means, unimportant .
Ouster ,
or
dispossession ,
is
a wrong
or injury that
carries with it the amotion of possession : for thereby the
wrong -doer gets into the
actual
occupation of land or
realty , and
obliges
its
rightful
owner
to
seek
his
legal
remedy
,
in
order
to
get possession
of
it
,
and also
to
re-
cover damages
for the injury sustained
.
And here the
reader will distinguish
between the right
of
possession
and the right
of
property
in
relation
to
land
,
heredita-
ments
and
tenements
;
for this
distinction
is
material
with
a
view
to
discerning
the classification
and nature of
some real actions
,
now abolished
,
at
which we purpose
very briefly and cursorily
to
glance
.

of
our Saxon ancestors

session

entry (a) , which was commonly
brought where the tenant ,
though
not entitled , had entered, without fraud
or tort ,
into possession of land , as by the deed or consent of one
who himself either came into possession of such land un-
lawfully , or had but a particular
or defeasible estate in it.
This writ was termed a writ of entry because
it not only
spoke of the entry of the tenant , but likewise showed for
what reason the possession ought not to be detained from
the demandant (b) .
The
possessory action thus initiated
was usually brought in the county court ; and we may ob-
serve that the proceedings in such an action were not then
so tedious when that
court was held , and process
issued
from it and was returnable
therein
at the end of every
three weeks,
as
they
became
after
the
Conquest , when
all
causes
were drawn into the king's courts , and pro-
cess
issued
only from term
to
term ; which was found
exceedingly dilatory , being at least four times
as slow as
it had before been .
And hence a new remedy was invented in many cases ,
to do justice
to the people , and to determine the right to
the possession of land in the proper county , and by the
king's judges .
This was the remedy by assize , which was
called by statute Westminster
2 , 13 Edw .
1 , c . 24, festi-
num remedium , in comparison with that by a writ of entry ;
it not admitting
of many dilatory pleas and proceedings ,
to which other real actions were subject.
The writ of assize is said to have been invented
by
Glanvil , chief justice
to Henry II.
( c) ; and, if so , may
have owed
its
introduction
to the
parliament
held
at
Northampton
in the twenty -second
year of that prince's
reign ; when justices in eyre were appointed to go round
the kingdom in order to take these assizes : and the assizes
themselves were clearly pointed out and described (d) .

JURISDICTION
OF
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF
LAW.
a writ of entry was a real action , which disproved the title
of the tenant by showing
the unlawful commencement
of his possession ;
so an
assize was a real action , which
proved the title of the demandant merely by showing his
or his ancestor's
possession (ƒ) ; and these
two remedies
were in other respects
so much
alike , that a judgment
or
recovery in one of them was a bar against the other ; so
that when
a man's possession had been once established
by either of these possessory actions , it could never have
been disturbed
by the same antagonist
in any other of
them .
The word assize , derived by Sir Edward
Coke (g) from
the
Latin
assideo , to sit
together , signified
originally ,
the jury who tried
the
cause , and sat together for that
purpose .
By a figure it was afterwards
made to signify
the court
or jurisdiction , which
summoned
this jury to-
gether by a commission of assize , or ad assisas capiendas ;
and hence the judicial
assemblies held
by commission
from the crown ,
as well to take writs of
assize
as
to
try causes
at nisi prius , were termed in common
speech
the assizes.
By
another
somewhat
similar
figure , the
name assize was also applied to the action for recovering
possession of land : for the
reason ,
says
Littleton (h) ,
why such writs at the beginning
were called assizes , was ,
that in them the sheriff
was ordered to summon
a jury ,
or assize ; which was not expressed in any other original
writ(i).
This remedy , by writ of assize , was only applicable
to
two species of injury by ouster, viz . abatement (k) , and a

upon the death of the
demandant's
father
or mother ,
brother
or
sister , uncle
or aunt ,
nephew
or
niece , the
remedy was by an assize of mort d'ancestor .
The writ
directed the sheriff
to summon a jury or assize , who were
to view the land
in question , and recognise whether such
ancestor were seised thereof on the day of his death , and
whether
the demandant
were the next
heir :

take the recognition

found in the affirmative , the law immediately

hold of the heir or devisee had been
overthrown
by the
intervention
of
a stranger .
An abatement
being
where
a person
had
died
seised of
an inheritance , and before the heir
or devisee entered , a stranger having
no right of entry got
possession of
the freehold
this
entry
of him
was
called
an
abatement , and
he
himself was denominated
an abator .
Finch, L. 195.
Such
abatement
of
a
freehold
was somewhat
similar to an imme-
diate occupancy in a state of nature ,
which is effected by taking posses-
sion
of the land
the
same instant
that the prior occupant by his death
relinquishes it.
But this , however
agreeable to natural
justice , consi-
dering
man merely as an individual
,
is diametrically
opposed to the law
of society , and particularly to the
law of England :
which,
for
the
preservation
of public
peace, has
prohibited
as
far
as
possible
all
acquisitions
by
mere
occupancy
:
and
has
directed
that
lands ,
on
the death of the present
possessor,
should
immediately
vest
either in
some person , expressly
named
and
appointed
by the deceased,
as his
devisee ; or, on default
of such ap-
pointment , in such one of his next
relations
as the law has selected and
pointed
out
as his
natural
repre-
sentative or heir.
The entry there-
fore of a mere stranger
by way of
intervention
between
the
ancestor
and heir or
person
next
entitled ,
which kept the heir
or devisee
out
of possession , was regarded
as one
of the highest
injuries
to the rights
of real property .
(7) Disseisin
is a wrongful
putting
out
of him who
is seised
of the
freehold .
Disseisin
may be effected
either in corporeal
or
incorporeal
inheritances .
Disseisin
of a thing
corporeal , as of a house , or land , is
by entry and actual dispossession of
the freehold ;
as if a man
enters
either
by
force
or fraud
into the

In an assize of novel (or recent ) disseisin
(m) ,
as in
that of
mort
d'ancestor
just
mentioned ,
the
demand-
ant's
possession must
have been shown .
In this action
a complaint
was
made by the
demandant
of the
dis-
seisin
committed , in terms of direct
averment ; where-
upon
the
sheriff was
commanded
to reseize the
land
and all the
chattels
thereon ,
and
keep
the
same
in
his
custody till
the
arrival
of
the
justices of
assize ;
and in the meantime to summon
a jury to view the pre-
mises in question , and
make
recognition
of the assize
before the justices . At which time the tenant might plead
either the general issue or any special plea.
And if, upon
the general
issue, the recognitors found
an actual seisin
in the demandant , and his
subsequent disseisin
by the
tenant ;
he
had
judgment
to recover
his
seisin ,
and
damages for the
injury sustained : this
being the only
case in which
damages were recoverable in a possessory
action at the common law (n) ; the tenant being in other
cases
allowed
to retain
the intermediate
profits
of the
land, to enable him to perform the feudal
services
apper-
taining to it ; though costs and damages were annexed to
many
other possessory actions by the statutes of Marl-
bridge , 52 Hen. 3 , c. 16 , and of Gloucester , 6 Edw. 1 , c. 1 .
In these possessory actions there was a time of limitation
settled , beyond which no man should avail himself of the
possession of himself or his ancestors , or take advantage
of the wrongful
possession of his
adversary .
For , if he
were negligent for a long and unreasonable
time , the law
refused afterwards
to lend him any assistance, to recover
the possession merely ; both to punish
his neglect (nam
leges vigilantibus ,
non
dormientibus, subveniunt ) , and also
because it was presumed that the supposed
wrongdoer had

in such a length of time procured
a legal title , otherwise
he would sooner have been sued.
By these several possessory remedies the right of pos-
session might formerly
have
been
restored to him
who
had been unjustly deprived thereof .
But the right of pos-
session (though
it carries with it a strong
presumption )
is not always conclusive evidence of the right of property ,
which may subsist in another man . For, as one man may
have the
possession
, and another the right of possession
,
which
was recoverable by a possessory action ; so one man
might have had the right of possession, and so might not
have been liable to eviction by any possessory action , and
another might have had the right of property , which could
not have been otherwise asserted than by the great and
final remedy of a writ of right (0) , or such correspondent
writs as were in the nature of a writ of right .
The writ of right was in its nature the highest writ in
the law (p), and lay only for an estate in fee - simple , and
not for him who had a less estate .
This writ lay concur-
rently with any other real
action , in which
an estate of
fee-simple might be recovered
; and also lay after it , being
as it were an appeal to the mere right, when judgment
had been had as to the possession in an inferior
possessory
action (q).
But though a writ of right might have been
brought , where the demandant was entitled to the possession
,
yet it rarely was advisable to bring it in such a case , since
a more expeditious and easy remedy was to be had , with-
out meddling with
the property , by proving
the demand-
ant's
own , or his
ancestor's , possession , and an illegal
ouster, in one of the possessory actions .
But in case the
right of possession had been lost by length of time , or by
judgment against the true owner in one of these
inferior
suits , there
was
no other choice.
The writ of right was

then the only remedy that
could
be had , and was of so
forcible
a
nature , that it
overcame
all
obstacles ,
and
cleared all objections that might have arisen to cloud and
obscure the title, for , after issue once joined in a writ of
right, the judgment
was absolutely
final ;
so that
a re-
covery had in this action might have been pleaded in bar
of any other claim or demand .
The
pure, proper , or mere writ of right lay only, we
have said, to recover land in fee -simple , unjustly withheld
from the true proprietor .
But there were also some other
writs which
were
said to be in the nature of a writ of
right.
The writ of right was brought , according
to circum-
stances , either in the court baron of the lord of whom the
lands were holden , or in the king's court ; and in the pro-
gress of this action the demandant
alleged some seisin of
the lands and tenements in himself, or else in some person
under whom
he claimed , and then derived the right from
the person so seised to himself ; to which the tenant might
have answered by denying
the demandant's
right ,
and
averring that he had more right to hold the lands than
the demandant
had to demand them : and , this right of
the tenant being shown , it then put the demandant upon
the proof of his title : in which , if he failed , or if the
tenant had shown a better , the demandant
and his heirs
were perpetually
barred of their claim ; but if the de-
mandant could make it appear that his right was superior
to the tenant's , he recovered
the land
against the tenant
and his heirs for ever ; though
even this writ of right ,
however superior
to any other , could not have been sued
out at any distance of time .
Real actions for the recovery of land having , long before
the passing of the
statute 3 & 4 Will . 4 , c. 27, become
almost entirely disused (r) , were by section 36 of that act

altogether abolished (s) ; so that the action of ejectment is
now the only direct mode of procedure for trying the title
to real
property ,
although
trespass
is
sometimes
made
indirectly available for that purpose .
Although
the
remedy
by ejectment
has
itself
been Ejectment
recently much simplified , yet , inasmuch
as it has become
the common method of trying the title to lands or tene-
ments , it may not be improper
to delineate , with
some
degree
of minuteness , its
history , the manner of its pro-
cess , and the principles
whereon it is grounded .
Ejectment
was originally an action brought by one who
had a lease
for years , to repair
the injury done him by
dispossession .
In order , therefore , to
convert it into a
method of trying title to the freehold , it was first
neces-
sary that the claimant should take possession of the lands ,
to empower him to
constitute
a lessee for years , who
might be capable of receiving this injury of dispossession .
When , therefore , a person , having
a right of entry into
lands , determined
to
acquire
that
possession , which was
wrongfully withheld
by the tenant , he made (as by law
he might) a formal
entry on the premises ; and being so
in the possession of the
soil , he there , upon
the
land ,
sealed
and delivered a lease for years to some third person
or lessee
and having
thus given him entry , left him
in
possession of the premises .
This lessee was to stay upon
the land, till the prior tenant , or he who had the previous
possession , entered thereon afresh and ousted him ; or till
some other person
(either
by accident
or by agreement
beforehand ) should come upon the land , and turn him out
or eject him.
For this injury, when committed , the lessee
became entitled
to his
action
of ejectment
against
the
tenant ,
or this " casual ejector," whichever it was that
ousted him , to recover back his term and damages .
But
where
this
action
was brought
against
such
a
casual

ejector as just mentioned , and not against the very tenant
in possession
, the court would not suffer the tenant to lose
his
possession
without
any
opportunity
to
defend
it.
Wherefore it was a standing rule , that no plaintiff should
proceed in ejectment
to recover
lands
against
a casual
ejector , without notice given to the tenant in possession (if
any there were) , and making him a defendant if he pleased .
And , in order to maintain the action , it was requisite for the
plaintiff, in case of any defence
being set up , to make out
four points
before the court ; viz ., title , lease , entry , and
ouster.
First , he must have shown a good title in his lessor ,
which brought the matter of right entirely before the court ;
then , that the lessor , being seised or possessed by virtue of
such title , did make him the lease for the present term ;
thirdly, that he , the lessee
or plaintiff , did
enter or take
possession in consequence
of such lease ; and then , lastly ,
that the defendant ousted or ejected him . On proof whereof
the plaintiff had judgment to recover his term and damages ;
and might, in consequence, have had a writ of possession
,
which
the sheriff
executed by delivering
to him the un-
disturbed
and peaceable
possession of his term.
Such was the regular
mode of bringing
an action of
ejectment ; but, as much trouble and formality were found
to attend the actual making of the lease , entry , and ouster ,
a more easy method of trying a title by ejectment , where
there was an actual
tenant or occupier of the premises in
dispute , was invented by the Lord Chief Justice Rolle (t),
who sat in the court of upper bench (u) during
the exile
of King Charles II.
This new method
entirely depended
upon a string of legal fictions ; no actual lease was made ,
there was no actual entry by the plaintiff, nor actual ouster
by the
defendant ; but these were merely
ideal , for the
sole purpose of trying the title .
To this end, in the pro-
ceedings a lease for a term
of years was stated to have

been made, by him who claimed title , to the plaintiff who
brought the action , as by John Rogers to Richard
Smith ,
it was also stated that Smith
the lessee entered ; and that
the defendant William
Stiles , who was called the casual
ejector, ousted him ; for which
ouster he
brought
the
action .
As soon as this action had been brought , and the
complaint
had been fully stated in the declaration , Stiles ,
the casual ejector , or defendant , sent a written
notice to
the tenant in possession of the lands , as George Saunders ,
informing him of the action
brought
by Richard
Smith ,
and transmitting
him
a copy of the declaration : withal
assuring him that he, Stiles the defendant , had no title at
all to the premises , and should
make no defence
;
and
therefore advising the tenant to appear in court and defend
his own title : otherwise he, the casual ejector, would suffer
judgment
to be had against him, and thereby the actual
tenant
Saunders would
be turned out of possession
.
On
receipt of this friendly
caution , if the tenant in possession
did not within a limited time apply to the
court to be
admitted
a defendant in the stead of Stiles , he was sup-
posed to have no right at all ; and , upon judgment
being
had against
Stiles
the casual ejector, Saunders the real
tenant would
have been turned
out of possession by the
sheriff .
But, if the
tenant in possession applied
to be made a
defendant , it was allowed him upon this
condition ; that
he should enter into a rule of court to confess , at the trial of
the cause , three of the four requisites for the maintenance
of the plaintiff's action ; viz . , the lease of Rogers the lessor,
the entry of Smith the plaintiff, and his ouster by Saunders
himself, now made the defendant instead of Stiles : which
requisites
being wholly fictitious , had the defendant put
the plaintiff to prove them , he must of course have
been
nonsuited
for want of evidence
; but by such
stipulated
confession of lease, entry , and ouster , the trial proceeded
upon the merits of the title only .
This done, the declara-
tion was altered by inserting the name of George Saunders

instead of William
Stiles , and the
cause went
to trial
under the name of Smith
(the plaintiff ) , on the demise of
Rogers (the lessor) , against Saunders , the new defendant .
And therein the lessor of the plaintiff was bound to make
out
a clear title , otherwise
his fictitious
lessee could not
have obtained judgment
to have possession of the land for
the term supposed to have been granted .
But , if the lessor
made out his title in a satisfactory manner , then judgment
and
a writ of possession went
for
Richard
Smith
the
nominal
plaintiff , who by this trial had proved the right
of John Rogers , his supposed
lessor.
Yet, to prevent the
fraudulent
recovery of the possession of land , by collusion
with the tenant thereof, a tenant was obliged , by a provi-
sion (x) (now repealed (y) ) of the stat . 11 Geo . 2 , c. 19 , on
pain of forfeiting
three years ' rent , to give notice to his
landlord , when served with any declaration in ejectment :
and the landlord might, by leave of the court , have been
made a co-defendant to the action , in case the tenant him-
self appeared
to it (≈) ; or , if he made default , though judg-
ment must then have been signed against the casual ejector ,
yet execution would have been
stayed in case the landlord
applied to be made a defendant , and
entered into
the
common rule ; a right which indeed the landlord
had long
before the provision of this
statute (a).
But , if the new
defendants , whether
landlord
or tenant , or
both ,
after
entering
into the common
rule , failed
to appear at the
trial , and to confess
lease , entry , and ouster , the plaintiff ,
Smith, must indeed have been
there nonsuited , for want
of proving those requisites (b) ; but judgment would never-
theless in the end have been entered against
the casual
ejector Stiles ; for the condition
on which
Saunders , or his
landlord , was admitted
a defendant had
been broken , and

therefore the plaintiff was put again in the same situation
as if he never had appeared
at all ; in consequence of which
(as we have seen ) judgment would
have been entered for
the plaintiff, and the sheriff , by virtue of a writ for that
purpose , would
have turned
out Saunders , and delivered
possession to Smith .
In order to complete the remedy by ejectment , an action
of trespass lay ,
after
a recovery therein , for the
mesne
profits
which the tenant in possession
had wrongfully
received .
The procedure in ejectment has , by the Common
Law
Procedure Act , 1852 , been much simplified
and improved .
Under the provisions
of this statute (c) the
action
now
commences by a writ-directed to the persons in possession
of the premises sought to be recovered by name, and gene-
rally to " all persons intitled
to defend the possession " of
the property
claimed-which is required to be described
with reasonable certainty in the writ.
The writ of ejectment (d) commands the parties to whom
it is directed , or such of them as deny the alleged title of
the claimant , within a certain period , viz . , sixteen
days ,
after service of the writ to appear in court , to defend either
for the whole or for part of the premises in question ; the
writ further notifies to the defendant (if there be only one ) ,
that in default of putting in an appearance
judgment
may
be signed , and he may be turned out of possession .
This
writ must be indorsed with the
address
of the attorney
issuing it, or (if it were issued by the plaintiff in person)
of the plaintiff.
It remains
in force for three
calendar
months , and must be served

of the premises (e) .

tenant merely , he must , under a penalty of forfeiting the
value of three years ' improved or rack rent of such premises ,
forthwith give notice that he has been so served to his
landlord .
When notice has been thus given , the landlord
will, by leave of the court or a judge , be allowed to appear
and defend
on filing
an affidavit
showing
that
he is in
possession of the land in question either by himself or his
tenant (ƒ) , and on entering
an appearance the landlord
will have to state expressly that he appears
as landlord ,
in which
case he will be at liberty to set up any available
and suitable
defence
to the action .
If, when an appearance has been entered
in an action
of ejectment ,
the
claimant
suffers the time ordinarily
allowed for going
to trial after issue joined (g ) to
elapse ,
the defendant in ejectment may give twenty days ' notice
to the claimant
to proceed to trial at the sittings or assizes
next after the expiration of the notice , and if the claimant
neglects to proceed to trial in pursuance of such notice ,
and the time for going to trial be not extended
by the court
or a judge , the defendant may sign judgment
and recover
the costs of his defence (h) .
Assuming that the tenant in possession appears to the
action within the time appointed (i) , the issue may at once
be made up without
any pleadings (k) ; particulars of the
claim and defence , if any , being annexed to the record by
the claimant (7).

the parties will then take place in the same
manner as in
other actions (m ) ; and the question to be tried and decided
between the claimant of the land and the defendant will
be " whether
the statement in the writ of the title of the
claimant is true or false , and , if true ," and there be several
claimants , " then which
of the claimants
is entitled , and
whether to the whole or part , and if to part , then to which
part of the property in question " (n) .
Moreover , it is com-
petent to any one in possession of land
actually or con-
structively
to come in and defend his
possession
, and to
contest the title to be put forward at the trial by the plain-
tiff, either
altogether , or
as
regards
a part only of the
premises mentioned in the writ (0) , and the issue will
be
restricted accordingly .
If at the trial the defendant
appears, and the claimant
does
not
appear, the claimant
will be nonsuited-if the
claimant
appears, and the defendant does
not appear, the
claimant will be entitled
to recover without any proof of
his title (p).
Further , if the title of the claimant
shall
appear to have existed as alleged in the writ , and at the
time of service thereof, but it shall also appear to have
expired before the time of trial , the claimant will notwith-
standing be entitled to a verdict according to the fact that
he was so entitled at the time of bringing the action and
serving the writ , and to a judgment
for his costs of suit (9) .
If the jury find for the
claimant , judgment
may then be
signed (r) , and execution
may issue for recovery of pos-
session of the property , or such part thereof
as the jury
shall
find
the
claimant
entitled

under the
improved
procedure :-In a
case
not
arising
between
landlord
and tenant
after
judgment
has
been
obtained in the action of ejectment , a separate action of
trespass
for
mesne
profits
must
be
brought .
Where ,
however , the ejectment is by a landlord
against his tenant
after a forfeiture
or otherwise , the claimant
may at the
trial (after
proof that the
defendant
was
served
with
notice of trial, and after proof
likewise by the plaintiff of
his right to recover possession of the whole or part of the
demised premises ) go into
evidence
of the
mesne profits
received down to the time of the verdict , and may recover
damages in respect thereof (t) .
In
Ejectment
is
a possessory action founded
upon a right
of entry in the party claiming title, and will in general lie
for any real property on which an entry may be made and
of which possession may be delivered by the
sheriff .
this action the plaintiff must recover on the
strength of
his
own title- not on the weakness of that of the
de-
fendant ;
mere possession, therefore , will
give
the de-
fendant
a prima facie right to the land in question (u).
" In
truth
and
substance ,"
as
long
since
judicially
observed ( ), " a judgment
in
ejectment is a recovery of
the possession (not of the
seisin
or
freehold ) without
prejudice to the right,
as it may hereafter appear even
between
the
parties ."
With
a view ,
however ,
to re-
pressing
vexatious
litigation which might ensue
if the
above doctrine
were unreservedly
applied , it is now pro-
vided
that the claimant
in
a second ejectment , brought
for the same premises
against
the
same defendant , may
by the court or a judge
be ordered to give security for
costs , with a stay of proceedings until such security shall
have been given (y) .

this Volume , may , subject to restrictions
as regards the
value of the property sought to be recovered
, be brought
in the county court ; and possession of premises may under
certain circumstances
be summarily
obtained either
there
or by
magisterial
intervention ,
as will
be
hereafter
mentioned .
The next species of injury to be noticed affecting a man's Trespass.
lands , tenements , or hereditaments is trespass.
Trespass ,
in its largest and most extensive sense , signifies any trans-
gression or offence
against the law of nature , of society ,
or of the country in which we live ; whether it relates to a
man's person or his property .
Therefore
beating
another
is a trespass (~) ; taking
a man's goods is a trespass ( a) ;
for which an action of trespass is given by the law
and ,
in general , any forcible
act of
one
man whereby another
is directly
injured , is
a transgression
or
trespass
in its
largest
sense , for which an action of trespass will lie.
But in the limited
and confined
sense , in which we are
at present to consider it, trespass signifies
no more than
an
entry
on
another
man's
ground
without
a lawful
authority , or doing
some
direct
damage , however incon-
siderable , to his real property .
For
the right of meum
and tuum, or property in land , being
once
established , it
follows
as a necessary
consequence
, that this right must
be
exclusive ;
that
is , that the
owner
may
retain
to
himself the
sole use and occupation of his soil :
every
entry
therefore
thereon without
the owner's
leave ,
and
especially if contrary to his express
order , is a trespass
or
transgression .
The
Roman
law
seems
to have made a
direct
prohibition
necessary, in order
to constitute
this
injury : qui alienum fundum
ingreditur , potest a domino , si
is prævideret, prohiberi
ne ingrediatur " (b).
But the law
of England, justly considering that
serious inconvenience
may happen to the owner, before he has an opportunity
to
forbid the entry , has carried the point much further , and

has treated every entry upon another's land (unless by the
owner's
leave , or in
some
very
particular
cases ) ,
as an
injury or wrong , for
satisfaction
of which
an
action of
trespass will lie ; though a jury in determining
the proper
quantum of that satisfaction , will
consider
how far the
offence
was wilful
or inadvertent , and will
estimate the
value of the actual damage sustained .
Every unwarrantable
entry
on
another's
soil
the law
entitles a trespass by " breaking
his close : " the words of
the
old writ of trespass commanding
the defendant
to
show
cause
quare
clausum
querentis fregit .
For
every
man's land is, in the
eye of the law, enclosed and
set
apart from his neighbour's : and that either by a visible
and material fence, as one field is divided from another by
a hedge ; or by an ideal invisible
boundary , existing
only
in the
contemplation
of law,
as when
one man's
land
adjoins another's in the same field .
And every such entry
or breach of a man's close carries necessarily along with it
some damage,
as the
treading
down
and
bruising his
herbage (c).
A person must have actual possession of land to be able
to maintain
such an action of trespass ; or at least , it is
requisite
that
he
have a possession of the vesture
and
herbage of the land (d) .
Thus if a meadow be divided
annually
among the parishioners
by lot , then after
each
person's several portion
is allotted , he may be capable of
maintaining
an action for the breach of his
close (e) : for
he has an exclusive
interest
therein
for the time .

Trespass will also lie by one en-
titled to a grant of underwood
(Cro .
Eliz . 413 ; Moor , 355, pl. 488), to
an exclusive right of digging
turves
(Wilson v. Mackreth , 3 Burr . 1824),
or to the exclusive
enjoyment
of a
crop
growing
on the
land
(Crosby
V.
Wadsworth ,
6 East , 602).
And
where the trespass is committed
by
a stranger , he may be sued by one
who has a mere possession , whether
founded
on
a good
title
or
not .

&
before entry and actual possession
, a person cannot main-
tain an action of trespass , though he has the freehold in
law (f).
And therefore
an heir
before entry upon land
cannot have this action , though
a disseisce might have it
against the disseisor , for the injury done by the disseisin
itself, at which time the plaintiff was seised
of the land :
and the customary heir of a copyholder
may after entry
sue for trespasses which
had been committed
previously
thereto , for after entry his title relates back (g).
A man is answerable for not only his own trespass , but
that of his cattle also : for , if by his negligent
keeping
they stray upon the land of another (and much more if he
permits or drives them on) , and they there tread down his
neighbour's
herbage , and
spoil
his corn or his
trees , this
is a trespass for which the owner must answer in damages ,
and the law gives the party injured
a double remedy in
this case ; by permitting him to distrain
the cattle thus
damage -feasant , or
doing
damage, till the owner
shall
make him satisfaction
:
or
else
by leaving
him to the
common remedy in foro contentioso , by action .
Indeed , an
action lies in either of these cases of trespass committed
upon another's land either by a man himself or his cattle ;
wherein a man was according
to the ancient form
called
upon to answer , quare vi et armis
clausum ipsius A. apud
B. fregit , et blada ipsius A. ad valentiam centum solidorum
ibidem nuper crescentia
cum quibusdam
averiis depastus fuit,
conculcavit, et consumpsit, &c. (h) : for the law has always
coupled the idea of force with that of intrusion
upon the
property of another .
And in the action
supposed if any
unwarrantable
act of the defendant or his beasts in coming
upon the land be proved , it is an act of trespass for which
the plaintiff must recover some damages , such as the jury
shall think proper to assess () .

JURISDICTION
OF
SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
In some cases trespass
is justifiable ; or rather entry on
another's land or into
his house shall
not be accounted
trespass
as if a man
comes
thither to demand
or pay
money , there payable ; or to execute , in a legal
manner ,
the process
of the law .
Also a man may justify entering
into an inn or public -house, without the leave of the
owner first specially asked ; because when a man professes
to keep such inn or public -house, he thereby gives a general
licence to any person properly conducting himself to enter
his doors.
So a landlord
may justify entering
to distrain
for rent ; a commoner to attend his cattle , commoning on
another's
land ; and a reversioner , to see if any waste be
committed
on the
estate (k).
Where, however , a man
having
lawfully entered on the property of another mis-
demeans himself, or makes an
ill
use
of
the authority with
which the law has entrusted him
,
he shall be accounted
a
trespasser ab initio
(1)
:
as
if
one comes
into
a
tavern and
will not go out
in
a
reasonable time
,
but tarries there all
night contrary
to
the inclinations
of
the owner
;
this wrong-
ful act will affect and have relation
back even to his first
entry
,
and make the whole
a
trespass
(

).
But
a
bare non-
feasance
,
as
not paying
for the wine
he
calls for
,
will
not
make him
a
trespasser
:
for this
is
only
a

unauthorised

So if a reversioner , who enters
on pre-
tence of seeing waste , breaks the house, or stays there all
night ; or if the commoner who
comes to tend his cattle ,
cuts down a tree ; in these and similar cases , the law judges
that he entered
for this unlawful
purpose , and therefore ,
as the act which
demonstrates such his purpose is a tres-
pass , he shall be esteemed
a trespasser ab initio (0).
A man
may also justify in an action of trespass
, on
account of the freehold , and right of entry upon the land
being in himself; and as such a defence
brings the title of
the estate in question , this is one of the ways devised , since
the abolition
of real actions , for trying the property to an
estate ; though it is not so usual
as that by ejectment .
Ejectment
, being a mixed action , not only gives damages
for the ejection , but also possession of the land ; whereas
in trespass, which is merely a personal action , nothing can
be recovered
but damages
for the wrong committed (p).
Another injury to a man's lands and tenements , may be Nuisance.

Nuisance , nocumentum

I. To cor-
poreal here-
it to the class of public wrongs (q)
and a private nuisance ,
which is for our present consideration .
We proceed , there-
fore , to mark out the several kinds of nuisances , and their
ordinary remedies.
In discussing
the several kinds
of nuisances , we will
consider , I.
Such nuisances
as may affect a man's cor-
poreal , and II. Those which may damage his incorporeal
hereditaments .
I. If a man builds a house
so close to mine that his roof
ditaments.
overhangs my roof, and throws the water off his roof upon
mine , this is a nuisance , for which an action will lie , even
without proof of special damage (r) .
We have seen , like-
wise, in our preceding Volume , that to erect a house or
other building so near to mine , that it obstructs my ancient
lights and windows , is a nuisance ; though if the windows
be
ancient , that is , have not subsisted for so long a time
without interruption
as to give a prescriptive
right , and
there be no covenant or contract affecting the matter , there
is no injury done.
For my neighbour
is as much entitled
to build a new edifice upon his ground as I am upon mine ;
since every man may erect what he pleases upon the up-
right or perpendicular of his own soil , so as not to preju-
dice what has long been enjoyed by another ; and it was
my folly to build so near another's ground
as to run the
risk of being thus incommoded .
And depriving
one of a
mere matter of pleasure , as of a fine prospect by building
a wall, or the like ; this,
as it abridges
nothing
really
convenient
or necessary, is no injury to the sufferer , and
is therefore not an actionable nuisance (s).
If we define
a private
nuisance ,
such as
here under
notice , to be any thing done to the hurt or annoyance of
the lands , tenements , or hereditaments of another (t), the
jury , on the trial of an action for nuisance , will have to
determine whether the act complained of did cause annoy-

ance , in a substantial degree , to the complainant
; they will
not have to consider merely whether the act complained of
was done in a place convenient for the purpose (u) .
And
whenever , taking all the circumstances into consideration ,
including the nature and extent of the plaintiff's enjoy-
ment
before the
acts
complained
of had
occurred , the
annoyance is sufficiently
great to amount to a nuisance at
law, according to the idea above given of it, an action will
lie against the person who caused
or erected
the nuisance ,
whatever the locality
may be (x). If a person keeps his
hogs ,
or other
noisome
animals ,
so
near the house of
another , that the
stench of them incommodes him and
makes the air unwholesome , this may be a nuisance , inas-
much as it tends to deprive him of the use and benefit of
his house (y) .
A like injury may be, if one's neighbour
sets up and exercises any offensive trade ; as a tanner's , a
tallow-chandler's , or the like ; for though these
are lawful
and necessary trades , yet they should be exercised in sub-
servience to the
rule , " sic
utere
tuo ,
ut
alienum
non
lædas "(z).
On the one hand , it has long
been
settled that a man
may, without being liable to an action , exercise a lawful
trade , as that of a butcher , a brewer , or the like , notwith-
standing it be carried
on so near the
house of another
as to be an annoyance to him in rendering
his residence
there less delectable or agreeable, provided the trade be so
conducted that it does
not
cause what amounts , in point
of law, to a nuisance to the neighbouring
house (a) .
On the other
hand , it is clear
that a person using a
limekiln , or other works , which
emit noxious
vapours , is
not justifiable
in doing
an actionable injury to another ;
and that any place where such an operation is carried on ,
so that it does occasion an actionable injury to another , is

erects
smelting -works for lead
so near the land of another , that
the vapour and smoke kill his corn and grass , and damage
his
cattle therein , this will be held
to constitute
a nui-
sance (c). And , generally , if one does any such act, in itself
lawful , which yet being done in that place necessarily tends
to the damage of another's property , it is a nuisance : and
it is incumbent
on the person carrying on such a noxious
business to find some other place in which to do that
act,
where it will be less offensive .
Here , however , a distinction
should be noticed
between
an action brought for a nuisance
upon the ground that it
produces
material
damage
to
property ,
and
an
action
brought for
a nuisance
upon the ground
that the thing
alleged to be a nuisance is productive of personal discom-
fort ;
an
answer to the
question
whether
that
which
interferes with one's personal
convenience and enjoyment
or quiet , which
discomposes
or injuriously affects
one's
senses
or nerves , may
be denominated
a nuisance , will
depend greatly on the circumstance where the thing com-
plained of actually occurs.
If a man lives in a town , of
necessity he should
subject himself to the consequences
of those operations of business which may be carried on in
his
immediate
locality , and are necessary for trade
and
commerce , also for the enjoyment of property and for the
benefit of the inhabitants
of the town and of the public at
large . If a man lives in a street where there are numerous
shops , and
a shop is opened
next
door to him
which
is
carried on in a fair and reasonable way , he has no ground
for complaint
because
to himself individually there may
arise much discomfort from the trade carried
on in that
shop .
But when a business is carried on by one person
in the neighbourhood
of another , and the
result
of that
business is a material injury , there
arises a different con-

sideration ; and the above rule as to the submission which
is required from persons living in society to that amount of
discomfort which may be necessary for the legitimate
and
free exercise of the trade of their
neighbours
would
not
apply under circumstances
the immediate result of which
is sensible damage to the value of the property (d).
Nuisances
are of course
almost infinitely dissimilar
in
kind ; thus
an excavation
made by a landowner
on his
own premises and left unfenced so very near to a highway
or
public
path
as
to be
dangerous , may constitute
a
nuisance ,
and
under
such circumstances
the landowner
may be liable
at suit of one who , passing lawfully along
the public
way, inadvertently
oversteps
its
boundary
and falls into the hole (e) .
So it may be a nuisance to
stop or divert water which has been accustomed to run to
another's
meadow or mill ; to corrupt
or poison a water-
course, by erecting
a dye-house or a lime -pit for the use
of trade , in the upper part of the stream , or in short to do
any act therein , that in its consequences
must
necessarily
tend to the prejudice
of one's neighbour (f).
So closely
does
the law of England
enforce that
excellent
rule of
gospel -morality , of " doing to others , as we would
that
they should do unto ourselves."
Not
only
a
nuisance
but a breach of duty
causing
damage
to real
property
will
be actionable ;
as if my
neighbour , who ought to scour a ditch , does not , whereby
my land is overflowed , this is an actionable
nuisance (g).
So if a person for his own purposes brings upon his
land ,
and collects and keeps there some material such as water,
likely , unless kept under control and within strict limits ,
to do mischief , the person who collects the
water
must
keep it in at his peril, and if it escapes

answerable for damage which

quence of its escape .
The party on whom this obligation
is imposed
can only excuse himself by showing that the
escape
was owing
to the default of the complainant , or
perhaps by showing
that it was the
consequence
of vis
major or of the act of God ( ).
And if a man
so negli-
gently
constructs
a hay-rick upon
the extremity
of his
land that , in consequence
of its spontaneous ignition , his
neighbour's
house is burnt , he may be liable
to be sued
for breach of duty ().
Let
us
next
consider the remedies which
the law has
allowed
for this injury of nuisance .
And
here I must
premise that the law gives no private remedy for anything
but a private wrong .
Therefore no action lies for a public
nuisance , but an indictment
only : because , the
damage
being
common
to
all the
queen's
subjects ,
no
one
can
assign his particular
proportion of it ; or, if he could , it
would be extremely hard if every subject in the kingdom
were allowed to harass
the offender with a separate
action .
For this reason, no person , natural
or corporate, can have
an action for a public
nuisance ; but
only the
queen in
her public
capacity can punish
the misdemeanant .
Yet
this rule admits of one exception ;
where a private person
suffers some extraordinary
damage , beyond the rest of the
queen's subjects , by a public nuisance ; in which
case
he
shall
have
a private
satisfaction
by
action .
As if, by
means
of a ditch
dug across
a public way , a man or his
horse sustain any damage by falling therein ; for this par-
ticular
damage, which is not common to others , the party
shall have his action (k ).
But a bookseller , who , having a
shop by the side of a public thoroughfare , suffers a tempo-
rary loss in his business in consequence
of passengers
being
diverted from it by an obstruction
wrongfully
erected
or
maintained
therein , cannot recover for such damage (1) .

And a reversioner may sue for damage caused
to his rever-
sionary interest by a nuisance (m).
Such an action is on
the
case , and in it an injunction
may be claimed
against
the repetition
or continuance of the injury , or the com-
mittal of any injury of a like kind relating
to the same
property or right ( n).
An action for nuisance will not , however , lie , unless
evidence be given of damage resulting
from the nuisance ,
and it may occasionally be necessary for the pleader by a
somewhat careful scrutiny to satisfy himself that damage
has really been
sustained
by one complaining
of such an
injury —that
what
is put forward
and
relied
upon
as
damage is not illusory merely , and inappreciable , but
is
susceptible of proof (0) .
Another remedy sometimes allowed by law to one ag-
grieved by a nuisance
is , the abatement or removal of it
by his own act (p) .
But if a man has abated , or removed,
a nuisance which
offended him, in this
case he is entitled
to no
action (q) .
For he
had choice of two remedies ;
either without suit , by abating it himself , by his own mere
act and authority
; or by suit , in which he may both recover
damages, and remove it by the aid of the law: and , having
made his election of one remedy , he is totally precluded
from the other.
Moreover , if there be two ways of abating
a nuisance , the
person abating it must
choose
the less
mischievous of the two (r).

of injury , that may be offered to real Waste.

the estate either in houses , woods, or lands ; by demolish-
ing not the temporary profits from them only , but the very
substance of the
thing ;
thereby
rendering
it wild and
desolate ; which
the common law expresses
significantly
by the word
vastum : and that
this
vastum , or waste, is
either
voluntary
or
permissive ;
the
one by an
actual
demolition
of the lands , woods , and houses ;
the
other
arising
from mere omission , negligence , and want of suffi-
cient
care in making
reparations , suffering
the
property
to fall into decay, and the like .
So that my only business
is at present to show , to whom this waste may be an injury
at law ; and who is entitled to any , and what , remedy in
respect ofit by action .
The persons who may be injured
by waste, are such as
have some interest in the estate wasted ; if, indeed , a man
be the absolute tenant of land in fee simple , without
any
incumbrance
or charge on the premises , or if he be tenant
in tail , without
impeachment
of waste , he may commit
whatever
waste his
own
indiscretion
may
prompt
him
to, without being
impeachable , or accountable
for it to
any one.
And , though his heir or the next tenant in tail
is sure to be the
sufferer, yet , in either of the cases men-
tioned , the person who possesses
and enjoys the property
may treat it as he likes , and cannot be called to account
for so doing by the party who may be afterwards
entitled
to it.
The nonliability of the tenant in fee simple results ,
indeed , from the well -known maxim , nemo est hæres viven-
tis ; no man is sure of succeeding him, as well on account
of the uncertainty
which shall die first , as also because the
tenant in fee has it in his own power to constitute what heir
he pleases , according
to the civil law notion
of a hæres
natus and a hæres factus : or, in the more accurate phrase-
ology of our English law, he may
aliene
or devise his
estate to whomever he thinks proper , and by such aliena-
tion or devise may disinherit
his heir at law.

damnum, it is, in
legal
contemplation ,
damnum
absque
injuria , and no action will lie for it.
A tenant
in tail,
without
impeachment
of waste, holding ,
as is said , per
formam doni , is not liable , if he commit it, by the express
words of the limitation under which he holds .
The most
effectual remedy for restraining
waste is , as already shown ,
afforded by a court of equity ; but in general an action on
the case in which an injunction
may be claimed (t) will lie
for it at law.
One species of interest , which may be injured by waste ,
is that of a person who has a right of common in the place
wasted ; especially if it be common of estovers , or a right
of cutting and carrying away wood for house -bote, plough-
bote, &c.
Here , if the owner of the wood demolishes the
whole wood , and thereby destroys all possibility
of taking
estovers , this is an injury to the commoner , amounting to
no less than a disseisin of his common of estovers , if he
chooses so to consider it ; for which he may have his remedy
by an action on the case .
But the interest in land most material , and most often
prejudiced
by the commission
of waste, is
that of the
remainder -man or reversioner
after a particular
estate in
being .
Here , if the particular
tenant (be it the tenant in
dower or by curtesy , who was answerable for waste at the
common law (u),
or the lessee for life or years , who was
first made liable by the Statutes of Marlbridge
(x) and of
Glocester (y) ) , if the particular
tenant , I say, commits or
suffers any waste, it is a manifest injury to him who has
the inheritance , as it tends to mangle
and dismember it
of its most desirable incidents and ornaments , among which
timber and
houses
may justly be reckoned the principal .

inheritance
appertains in expectancy (~) , our ancient law

which
an action
on the
case
is now maintainable .
This
latter remedy, indeed , is more widely applicable than was
the action of waste , which lay for him only who had the
inheritance
in reversion or remainder in the land wasted ,
whereas
case will lie for him entitled
as
reversioner
or
remainder -man for life or years (b) .
In such action the
defendant , on the trial , may give in evidence any thing
that
proves there was no waste committed ,
as that the

happened by lightning, tempest , the king's
enemies
, or other inevitable
accident (c).
An
action will
not , however , lie for permissive waste (d) .
A service is sometimes due by ancient custom and pre-
scription
only , for the withholding
of which
a remedy by
action may be had .
Such is that of doing suit to another's
mill
where the persons, resident in a particular
place, by
usage time
out of mind
have been accustomed to grind
their corn at a certain mill ; and afterwards any of them
go to another mill , and withdraw
their
suit (their secta , a
sequendo ) from the ancient mill .
This may be not only a
damage , but
an injury to the owner ; such prescription ,
indeed ,
might
have had
a very
reasonable
foundation ;
viz ., upon the erection of such mill by the
ancestor of
the owner for the convenience of the inhabitants , on con-
dition , that , when erected , they should all grind
their corn
there only .
And for this injury the owner might formerly
have had a writ de sectá ad molendinum (e) , commanding
the defendant to do his suit at that mill , quam

in which action the validity of the prescription might have

pleases (j) .
2.
The disturbance
of common
occurs where an act is
done, by which the right of another to his common is in-
commoded
or diminished .
This may happen , where one
who has no right of common , puts his cattle on the land ;
and thereby
robs the
cattle of the
commoners of their
respective
shares
of the pasture .
Or if one , who has a
right of common , puts in cattle which
are
not common-
able ,
as
hogs
and goats ;
which
amounts
to
the
same
inconvenience .
But the lord of the soil
may (by custom
or prescription , but
not without ) put
a stranger's
cattle
on to the common ( k) ; and also , by a like prescription
for
common appurtenant , cattle that are not commonable may
be put on to the common (7).
The lord
also of the soil
may justify making burrows therein , and putting in rabbits ,
provided
they do not increase to so large a number as to
destroy
the
common (m).
But in general , in
case
the
beasts of a stranger , or the uncommonable
cattle of a
commoner , be found upon the land, the lord or any of the
commoners may distrain
them damage-feasant ( n).
And
the commoner may bring an action on the
case to recover
damages, without
proving any specific damage to himself,
against
a person wrongfully
depasturing
cattle
on the
common , because the law considers
that the right of the
commoner is injured
by such an act, and therefore allows
him to bring an action for it to prevent a wrongdoer from
gaining a right by repeated
acts of encroachment .
For
wherever any
act injures
another's
right, and would be
evidence in future in favour of the wrongdoer , an action
may be maintained
for an invasion of that right , without
proof of specific injury ; that is to say , wherever one man
does an act, which , if repeated, would operate
in deroga-
tion of the right of another , he is liable
to an action ,

without proof of particular
damage , at suit of the person
whose right may be so affected (0).
Another
disturbance of common is by surcharging it ;
or putting
more
cattle
thereon
than
the
pasture
and
herbage will sustain , or the party has a right to do .
In
this
case he who surcharges
does an injury to the rest of
the owners , by depriving
them of their respective portions ,
or at least diminishing them .
This injury by surcharging
can, properly
speaking , only happen , where the common
is appendant or appurtenant (p) , and of course limitable
by law ; or where , when in gross , it is expressly limited
and certain .
The remedy , for surcharging
the common , is either by
distraining
so many of the beasts
as are above the number
allowed , or else
by an action of trespass , which
may be
had by the
lord ; or by an action on the case , in which
any commoner may be plaintiff (q) .

The
ancient
method
of proceed-
ing, under the circumstances , supra ,
was by writ of admeasurement
of
pasture .
This lay
either
where
a
common
appurtenant
or
in
gross
was certain
as to number , or where
a man
had
common
appendant
or
appurtenant
to his land , the
quan-
tity of which
common
had
never
been
ascertained .
In
either
of
these cases, any of the
commoners
was
entitled
to this
writ
of
ad-
measurement ; which was directed
to the sheriff , and not returnable
to
any superior
court , till finally ex-
ecuted by him. It recited
a com-
plaint, that the defendant
had
sur-
charged ,
superoneravit ,
the
com-
mon
and therefore commanded the
sheriff
to admeasure
and apportion
it ; that the
defendant
might
not
have
more
than
belonged
to him,
and that the plaintiff might have his
rightful share .
And upon this suit
all the commoners
were to be ad-
measured ,
as well those who
had
not , as those
who had
surcharged
the common ; as well the plaintiff as
the defendant .
The execution ofthe
writ was by a jury of twelve
men ,
who were upon their oaths to ascer-
tain , under
the
superintendence
of
the
sheriff ,
what
and how
many
cattle
each commoner was entitled
to feed.
And the rule
for
this
ad-
measurement
was generally
under-
stood to
be, that the
commoner
should
not turn more
cattle
upon
the common than were sufficient
to
manure and stock the land to which
his right of common was annexed ;
or, as our ancient
law expressed it,
such cattle only as were levant and
couchant
upon
his tenement .

OF SUPERIOR
COURTS

There is yet another disturbance of common
to be here
noticed , when the
owner of the
land ,
or other
person ,
so encloses
(r) or obstructs it , that the commoner is pre-
cluded from enjoying the benefit therefrom to which he is
by law entitled .
This may be done , by erecting houses or
fences on the common , or by driving the cattle
off the
land , or by ploughing
up the soil of the common (8).
Or
it may be done by erecting a warren therein , and stocking
it with rabbits
in such
quantities , that they devour the
whole
herbage , and thereby
destroy the common .
For
the law looks upon this as an injurious
disturbance of the
commoner's right , and has given him his remedy by action
against the owner (t) .
The policy of our law, however , is not to allow a com-
moner to abate
a nuisance upon the common , except only
in few
cases , for
an action will best ascertain
the just
measure of the damage which may have been
sustained .
But if the lord erect
a wall, gate , hedge, or fence round
the common , to prevent the commoner's cattle from going
into the common , the commoner may abate the erection (u) ,
because it is inconsistent with the grant actual or presumed
under which
he claims .
The interest which a commoner
has in the common , is usually to eat the grass by the
mouths of his cattle .
But he cannot cut the
But he cannot cut the grass , wood,
bushes , fern , or other things growing
on the common , nor
can he make fish -ponds there (x) .
So if the lord plant
trees on the common , whereby the commoner cannot have
his common
so beneficially
as he ought , the
commoner
cannot cut them down , for they are part of the soil itself ;
but he must bring an action on the case against the lord (y).

And if the lord's rabbits increase so much that there is not

divided into three parts , he may spend one part in going ,
another
in returning ,
and the third in transacting
his
necessary business there.
If such market
or fair be on
the
same day with mine , it is prima facie a nuisance to
mine , and there
needs
no proof of it, but the law will
intend it to be so ; but if it be on any other day , it may
be a nuisance ; though whether it is so or not , cannot be
intended or presumed , but I must make proof of it to the
jury.
5.
Likewise, if a ferry is erected on a river ,
so near an-
other ancient ferry as to draw away its custom , it is a nui-
sance to the owner of the old
one .
For where there is a
ferry by prescription , the owner is bound to keep it always
in repair and readiness
, for the ease of all the subjects of
the crown ; otherwise
he may be grievously
amerced
( ) :
it would
be therefore extremely hard , if a new ferry were
suffered
to share his profits , which
does not also share his
burthen .
But where the reason ceases , the law also ceases
with it
therefore it is no nuisance to erect a mill so near
mine , as to draw away the custom , unless the miller also
intercepts
the water .
Neither is it a nuisance
to set up
any trade, or
a school , in a neighbourhood
or rivalship
with another
for by such emulation
the public
are like
to be gainers ; and , if the new mill or school occasion a
damage to the old one , it is damnum absque injuriâ (i).

Another
species
of disturbance
mentioned by legal
writers
of
repute ,
although
perhaps
unknown
at the
present day , is that of disturbance of tenure , or breaking
that connection which
subsists between the lord and his
tenant , and which the law will not suffer to be wantonly
dissolved by the act of a third person .
To have an estate
well tenanted is an advantage of which
every landlord
must
be sensible : and therefore
the driving away of a
tenant from off his estate is an injury of no small
conse-
quence.
So that if there be a tenant at will of any lands

and threats,
or by unlawful distresses , or by fraud and circumvention ,
or other means , contrives to drive him away , or inveigle
him to leave his
tenancy , this the law might justly con-

give him a reparation
in damages against the offender by

The last and most considerable species of disturbance
7. Disturb
to be noticed , is that of patronage ; being a hindrance
or patronage.
obstruction
of the
patron in presenting
his
clerk
to
a
benefice.
This injury was distinguished
at common law from an-
other
species
of injury , called usurpation ; which is an
absolute ouster or dispossession of the patron , and happens
when a stranger , who has no right , presents a clerk , who
is thereupon admitted and instituted
( ).
In which
case ,
of usurpation , the patron lost by the common law not only
his turn of presenting pro hac vice , but also the absolute and
perpetual inheritance of the advowson , so that he could not
present again upon the next avoidance , unless in the mean
time he recovered his right by a real action , viz . , a writ of
right of advowson ( m ) , now abolished (n). The reason given
for his losing the present turn , and not ejecting the usurper's
clerk , was that the final intent of the law in creating this
species of property being to have a
fit
person
to
celebrate
divine
service
,
it
preferred the
peace
of
the church
(
pro-
vided

)
to
the
right
of
any patron
whatever
(o).
And
the patron
also
lost the inheritance of his advowson
,
unless
he recovered
it
in
a
writ
of
right
,
because
by such usurpation
he was
put out
of
possession
of
his advowson
,
as
much
as
when by
actual entry and ouster
,
he was disseised
of
lands
or
houses
;
since the only possession
of
which an advowson
is
capable
,
is
by actual presentation and admission

one's clerk

therefore , when the clerk was once
instituted
(except in
the case of the crown , where he must also be inducted (p))
the church became
absolutely full ;
so the usurper by such
plenarty , arising
from
his
own
presentation ,
became
in
fact
seised
of the advowson : which
seisin it was impos-
sible for the true patron to remove by any
possessory
action , or other means , during the plenarty or fulness of
the church ; and when it became void afresh , he could not
then
present , since another
had the right of possession .
The only remedy therefore , which the patron had left , was
to try the
mere right in
a writ of right of advowson ;
which was a peculiar writ of right , framed for this special
purpose (q) : and if a man recovered
therein , he regained the
possession of his advowson , and was entitled to present at
the next avoidance (r) .
But in order to such recovery he
must have alleged a presentation in himself or some of his
ancestors, proving
him or them to have been once in pos-
session
for, as a grant of the advowson , during the ful-
ness of the church , conveys no manner of possession for
the present , therefore a purchaser , until he had presented ,
had no actual seisin whereon to ground a writ of right (s) .
Thus stood the common law.
But bishops in ancient
times , either by carelessness
or
collusion , frequently instituting clerks upon the presenta-
tion of usurpers , and thereby defrauding
the real patrons
of their right of possession, it was in substance
enacted
by statute Westm. 2 , 13 Ed .
1 , c.
5 , s . 2 , that if a pos-
sessory action were brought within six months
after the
avoidance , the patron should
(notwithstanding
such usur-
pation
and
institution ) recover that
very
presentation
;
which gave back to him the seisin of the advowson .
Yet
still, if the true patron omitted to bring his action within
six months , the seisin was gained by the usurper , and the
patron , to recover it, was driven to the long and hazardous

process
of a writ of right. To remedy which it was further
enacted by statute
7 Anne , c. 18 , that no usurpation
shall
displace the estate or interest of the patron , or turn it to a
mere right ; but that the true patron
may present upon
the next avoidance , as if no such usurpation had happened .
So that the title of usurpation was thus much narrowed ,
and the law now stands upon this reasonable foundation : that
if a stranger usurps my presentation , and I do not pursue
my right within six months , I shall lose that turn without
remedy , for the peace of the church , and as a punishment
for my own negligence
; but
that turn is the only one I
shall lose thereby .
Usurpation
now gains no right to the
usurper , with regard to any future
avoidance , but only to
the present vacancy : it cannot
indeed be remedied after
six months
are past ; but during those six months , it is
only a species of disturbance .
Disturbers of a right of advowson may therefore be these
three persons ; the pseudo-patron , his clerk , and the ordi-
nary ; the pretended patron , by presenting to a church to
which he has no right, and thereby making it litigious or
disputable
; the clerk , by demanding or obtaining institu-
tion , which tends to and promotes the same inconvenience ;
and the ordinary , by refusing
to admit
the real patron's
clerk , or admitting
the clerk of the pretender .
These dis-
turbances are vexatious
and injurious
to him who has the
right : and therefore , if he be not wanting to himself, he
may still
have for his relief a writ of quare impedit ; in
which the patron , not the clerk , is plaintiff.
For the law
supposes
the injury to be offered
to the patron only , by ob-
structing
or refusing the admission of his nominee ; and
not to the clerk , who has no right in him till institution
,
and of course can suffer no injury.

bound to present within six calendar
months (t) , other-
wise it will lapse to the bishop .
But if the
presentation
be made within that
time , the bishop
is bound to admit
and institute
the clerk , if found
sufficient (u) ; unless the
church be full , or there be notice of any litigation.
For if
opposition be intended , it is usual for
each
party to enter
a
caveat with the
bishop , to
prevent
institution
of his
antagonist's
clerk .
An institution after a caveat entered
is void by the ecclesiastical law (x) ; but this the temporal
courts pay no regard to , and look upon a caveat as a mere
nullity (y).
But if two presentations
be offered to the
bishop upon the same
avoidance , the church is then said
to become
litigious
; and , if nothing
further
be done , the
bishop
may suspend the admission of either , and suffer a
lapse to incur.
Yet if the patron
or clerk
on either side
request him to award a jus patronatûs , he is bound to do
it.
A jus patronatûs
is a commission from the bishop ,
directed usually to his chancellor and others of competent
learning : who are to summon a jury of six clergymen and
six laymen , to inquire
into and examine who is the right-
ful patron ; and if, upon such inquiry made and certificate.
thereof
returned
to the
commissioners , he admits
and
institutes
the
clerk of that patron whom they return
as
the true one , the bishop secures himself at all events from
being a disturber , whatever proceedings may be had after-
wards in the temporal courts (z).
The clerk refused by the bishop may also have a remedy
against him in the spiritual
court , denominated
a duplex
querela(a) : which
is a complaint
in the nature of an ap-
peal from the ordinary to his
next
superior ; and if the
superior court adjudges the cause of refusal to be insuffi-
cient , it will grant institution to the appellant (b).

Thus far matters may go on in the mere ecclesiastical
course ; but in contested presentations
they seldom go so
far
for, upon the first
delay or refusal of the bishop to
admit his clerk , the patron
may bring his action of quare
impedit against the bishop , for the temporal
injury done
to his
property , in
disturbing
him in his
presentation .
And , if the delay arises from
the
bishop
alone , as upon
pretence of incapacity , or the like , then he only is sued ;
but if there be another presentation
set up , then the pre-
tended patron and his clerk are also joined in the action ;
or it may be brought
against the patron and clerk , leaving
out the bishop ; or against the patron only . But it is most
advisable to bring it against all three : for if the bishop be
left out , and the suit be not determined till the six months
are past , the bishop is entitled to present by lapse ; for he
is not party to the suit ; but , if he be named , no lapse
can possibly accrue till the right is determined . If the
patron be left out , and the action
be brought
against the
bishop and the clerk only , the suit is of no effect , and will
abate ; for the right of the patron is the principal
question
in the cause (c). If the clerk be left out , and has received
institution
before the action brought
(as is sometimes the
case ), the
patron
by this suit
may recover his right of
patronage , but not the present turn ; for he cannot have
judgment to remove the clerk , unless he be made a de-
fendant , and party to the suit, to hear what he can allege
against it.
For which
reason it is the safer way to bring
the action against all three .
Quare impedit is now commenced by a writ of summons
issuing
out of the court of common
pleas, in the
same
manner and form as the writ of summons in an ordinary
action , and upon
such writ is indorsed
a notice that the
plaintiff intends
to declare in quare impedit (d).

JURISDICTION
OF SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF LAW.
A
and all other proceedings
and
costs
upon the writ , have
been made subject to the same rules and practice , as nearly
as may be, as the proceedings in an ordinary
action (e) , of
which a sketch will be given in our next
chapter ; and
therefore it seems unnecessary to insert at length in these
pages the practice and procedure in a suit such as treated
ofin accordance
with the antiquated form (f) . Thus much,
however , may properly be said , that the plaintiff in a quare
impedit must state his title , and prove at least one presen-
tation in himself, his
ancestors , or those under whom he
claims ; for he must recover by the strength
of his own
right , not by the weakness of the defendant : and he must
also show a disturbance before the action brought .
Upon
this the bishop and the clerk
may disclaim all title :
save
only , the one as ordinary , to admit and institute
; and the
other as presentee of the patron , who is left to defend his
own right (g) . And upon failure of the plaintiff in making
out title , the
defendant is put upon the proof of his , in
order to obtain judgment for himself, if needful .
But
if the right be found for the plaintiff , on the trial , three
further points are also to be inquired of :
1. If the church
be full , and , if full , then of whose presentation : for if it be
of the defendant's presentation , then the clerk is removable
by writ brought in due time .
2. Of what value the living
is

assess

an

PROCEEDINGS
IN THE

COURTS

AN
ACTION
AT LAW.
THE rights and obligations of which
our courts of law
take cognisance , and for the invasion or breach of which they
afford a remedy by action , having been treated of in other
parts of this work , we propose here to give some general
account of an action at law, and the proceedings in it.
beforetrial .
We must here accordingly
repeat (a) that actions have Proceedings
been from ancient times divided into three
classes ,-real ,
personal , and mixed .
Real actions are those brought for
the recovery of real property only ; mixed , for the recovery
of real
property ,
and damages for its being wrongfully
withholden
; while personal actions extend to all claims for
money due on contracts , or for damages
for breach of con-
tract , or injury
to person or property ,
and
also to the
recovery of specific goods and chattels , though not for the
recovery of land .
Personal
actions
are broadly
divided
into actions ex contractu and ex delicto , and they embrace
perhaps the
widest
range of those civil differences that
can become subjects of litigation in this country .
In this chapter we shall
speak of procedure
only , and
will treat of it in an ordinary
personal
action .
It may
here be premised that the very numerous and highly tech-
nical forms of real and mixed actions which
existed prior
to the 3 & 4 Will. 4 , c. 27, were by that Act all abolished
except four , viz ., writ of right of dower , dower
unde nihil
habet , quare impedit , and ejectment ; and by the Common
Law Procedure Act , 1860 , it was further
enacted (6) that
(a) Ante , pp. 126, 127.

no writ of right of dower , or writ of dower unde nihil habet,
and no plaint for freebench or dower (c) in the nature of
any
such writ , and no quare impedit
should be brought
after the commencement of that Act in any court whatso-
ever ; but where any such writ, action , or plaint would lie ,
either in a superior or in any other court , an action might
be commenced by writ of summons
issuing
out of the
court of common pleas , in the
same manner and form
as
the writ of summons in an ordinary
action ; and by s. 27
the writ ,
and all proceedings
thereupon
are to
be,
as
nearly as may be , the same as in ordinary
actions .
The
action of ejectment
is treated of in another
part of this
work (d).
Taking the
case , then , of an ordinary
personal
action ,
it may be first
observed
that the proceedings in it are so
regulated
throughout
that judgment
is given
against no
man without his having
been
heard , or through his own
default refusing to be heard after due notice of the grounds
of claim
against him.
The action is commenced by the
complainant
summoning
the defendant
to appear in the
action to answer a complaint
against him.
The appear-
ance required of him is not at this stage of the proceedings
an appearance in open court , but a formal entry in writing
at the proper office of the court made by the defendant or
his
attorney , which in effect
admits
that the defendant
has been duly summoned , and is ready to defend
himself
against any complaint
the plaintiff may bring against him
in the action .
The instrument by which he is thus sum-
moned is called a writ of summons , and may be issued at
the option of the plaintiff out of any one of the superior
courts of common law,-the queen's bench , the common
pleas , or the exchequer .

to mention
any form or cause of ac-
tion in the writ of summons (e), a statement of the grounds

the

A statement of the grounds of claim against the defen-

to obtaining
judgment
against him, it is however only in certain
cases.

provided
for ,-for
example in
cases that come
under the provisions of the 25th and 27th sections of the
Common Law Procedure Act , 1852 , relating
to special in-
dorsements of the particulars of debts or liquidated demands
on the writ of summons , where judgment
follows on the
writ without
any further
statement of the cause of action
on default of appearance ; also, in proceedings under the
summary
Bills
of Exchange
Act ,
1855 (f), where the
statement of the cause of action is on the writ , judgment
follows , unless the defendant appears after leave obtained
for that purpose in the manner provided by that Act .
Though the court issues the writ , it may be obtained as
a matter of course by any person who
seeks to commence
an action against
another .
It is open to any person who
conceives
he has a cause of action
against
another at his
own pleasure, and it may be added , at his own risk, to sue
out a writ of summons against him ; all that is necessary
is for the plaintiff or his
attorney to prepare the writ in
accordance with the
statutory
form , take it to the writ
office of the court in which the action is brought , and have
it impressed with the seal of the court , at the
same
time
leaving a præcipe , or memorandum of the writ with the
officer who files it and enters the date thereof
and other
particulars .
The forms of the writ of summons in personal
actions ,
and
certain
indorsements
to be made on it, the appear-
ance, and many other matters relating
to the
process by
which
an action

by s. 2 of

that follow next in succession to s. 33 inclusive (9) , taken
in connection with schedule (A. ) of the Act .
Among other
things it may be noticed that
the writ is entitled in the
queen's name , bears date the day it issues , is tested in
the name of the chief justice
or chief baron of the court ,
or in case of a vacancy in that of the senior judge ,
and
states the name of the plaintiff and the name and resi-
dence, or supposed residence of the defendant to whom it
is addressed, and certain indorsements
are required to be
made on it ( ).
The common indorsements
(i) on the writ
are the name and place of abode of the attorney who sues
it out , or the address
of the plaintiff if it be sued out by
him in person.
In all actions which
are brought
for the
payment of any debt , the amount of the debt and costs is
to be indorsed on the writ , and if they be paid within four
days from service of the writ the proceedings will be stayed .
This indorsement does not , like the special indorsement we
have already alluded
to , give a statement or particulars of
the grounds of action , but merely of the amount

(h) Sect . 20 of the
act is as fol-

at-
torney shall omit to insert in or in-
dorse
on any writ
or copy thereof
any of the matters required by this

the costs up to that time , in order to give the
defendant
an opportunity
of staying
further
proceedings
by paying
them (). If the
amount indorsed is not paid within the
four days the action may proceed as if the indorsement had
not been made.
The special indorsement is provided for by
s. 25 of the Procedure Act of 1852 in cases where the de-
fendant
resides within the jurisdiction of the court , and
the claim
is for a debt or liquidated
demand in money
with or without
interest , arising
on a contract
express or
implied (k).
In such and similar cases the plaintiff is at
liberty to make
upon the writ of
summons
and
copy
thereof
a special
indorsement
of the particulars
of the
claim in the form
contained in the schedule (A.) to that
Act , and the effect of this
section in connection with the
subsequent section (s . 27 ) of the Act , is
that final judg-
ment may be signed in default of appearance
, and execu-
tion may issue against
the defendant within eight days
after the last day for entering an appearance.
Section 25
also
contains
a provision
that it shall
be lawful for the
court or a judge , either
before or after final judgment , to
let in the defendant to defend upon
an application
sup-
ported by satisfactory affidavits accounting for non -appear-
ance , and disclosing
a defence
on the merits .
The essential preliminary -that
there must
be a state-
ment of the cause of action duly notified
to the defendant
before judgment
can be obtained against him, will be ex-
emplified by noticing
a little more in detail the difference
between the mode of proceeding on the writ specially in-
dorsed and the procedure on that which is not so , where
default is made in appearing .
On the writ specially
in-
dorsed with the statement of the grounds
of claim
or
cause of action , judgment may be signed at once for non-
appearance, on an affidavit
being filed of personal
service
of the writ of summons
or a judge's
order for
leave to
proceed, and a copy of the writ of summons ;

case of the writ not specially indorsed , on which
there is
no statement of the cause of action , there must not only
be such affidavit , and a copy of the writ filed , but also a
declaration , which is a written
statement of the
cause of
action , must
be filed , indorsed with a notice to plead in
eight days, and to sign judgment
by default at the expira-
tion ofthe time to plead so indorsed ; and in the event of
no plea being delivered , where the
cause of action
stated
in the declaration
is for any of the claims which might
have
been
inserted
in a special
indorsement ,
and the
amount claimed is indorsed on the writ of summons , final
judgment
may
be
signed
and
execution
issue for
an
amount
not exceeding the amount
indorsed on the writ ,
with interest and costs
as in the Act specified.
The
forms
of the ordinary writ of summons , and the
specially indorsed writ, and the writs for service out of the
jurisdiction,
though
in
other
respects
they
may differ,
have this feature in common , that
they require the defen-
dant to cause an appearance to be entered for him in the
court out of which the writ issues in the action at the suit
of the plaintiff
within
a certain
time
after
service of
the writ , and give him notice that in default of his doing
so , the
plaintiff
may
proceed to judgment and
execu-
tion (1).
The time within which an appearance is required
to be entered is, in the case of the writs for service within
the jurisdiction, a fixed period of eight days after the ser-
vice of the writ , inclusive of the day of such service ; but
in writs
for service out of the jurisdiction, the time for
appearance
is regulated by the
distance from England of
the
place where the defendant resides.
It may here be
observed with regard
to proceeding
to " judgment and
execution ," that in the
case of a defendant who is out of
the jurisdiction , " execution " can only issue against pro-
perty which he may have in this country .
The
original writ of summons is in force for six (m)

months (n) only from the day of its date.
Concurrent
writs (0) may , however , be issued , certain
prescribed for-
malities
being
complied
with ;
these
concurrent
writs
bearing the same date as the original writ , but being only
in force for the period during which the original writ is in
force .
The use of a concurrent writ
is to give a better
opportunity
of serving the defendant or defendants in the
action than a simple writ would afford .
For instance , the
ordinary writ of summons for service within the jurisdic-
tion may be served in any county , but if the defendant be
found to be residing
abroad ( p) , a concurrent
writ may
issue for service out of the jurisdiction
for the purpose of
reaching him there .
The
original
writ
must be
served
within six months
from the date unless it be renewed ,
as it may be with certain
formalities
prescribed by the
Act (9) before the expiration of the six months , and such
renewal may be repeated from time to time .
In this way
an action may be commenced and kept
alive
for
years ,
and when
service is ultimately
effected , be it sooner or
later , the commencement of the action against the defen-
dant is the original writ of summons , which
remains in
force ,
and
is
available
to prevent the operation of any
statute whereby
the time for the commencement of the
action may be limited , and for all other purposes from the
date of the issuing of the original writ of summons .
The
service of the writ of summons must , wherever it is prac-
ticable , be personal (r) (personal service being effected by
informing the defendant of the writ,
and
at the same
time

a copy of it to him ,

and
though
provisions
are
made for proceeding in the action where personal
service
cannot be effected , but the defendant
knows of the writ
and evades the service , yet this is matter of special appli-
cation to the court or a judge , and it is only on being
satisfied by affidavit
that reasonable
efforts
have
been
made to effect personal
service, and either that the writ
has come to the knowledge of the defendant , or that he
wilfully evades the service of the same, and has not ap-
peared thereto , that an order will be granted by the court
or a judge , that the plaintiff
be at liberty
to proceed
as if
personal service
had been
effected , subject

tions as to the court or judge may seem

The power
of
proceeding
by action
in this
country
against
a
defendant
out of the jurisdiction ,
was first
given
by the
Procedure
Act of
1852
(x) .
It
does
not
extend to a defendant , being a British subject , residing in
Scotland
or Ireland , and is limited
to those cases where
there is a cause of action which
arose within the jurisdic-
tion , or in respect of the breach of a contract made within
the jurisdiction
, and is carefully
guarded
throughout
by
provisions
directed
against
any unfair advantage being
taken of the defendant by reason of his absence
from this
country .
As well in an action against
a British subject
residing
out of the jurisdiction as in an action against
a
foreigner
so residing , where the defendant
has failed to
appear within the time limited
for that purpose , the plain-
tiff can only proceed
by leave of the court or a judge , who ,
upon being
satisfied
by affidavit
that there is a cause of
action which
arose within the jurisdiction , or in respect of
the breach of a contract made within the jurisdiction , and
that the writ was personally
served
upon the defendant , or
that reasonable efforts were made to effect
personal ser-
vice thereof upon the defendant , and that it came to his
knowledge , and either
that
the defendant wilfully neg-
lects to appear to such writ , or that he is living out of the
jurisdiction of the court in order to defeat and delay his
creditors , may direct , from time to time , that the plaintiff
shall be at liberty to proceed in the action in such manner ,
and subject to such conditions
as to such court or judge
may
seem
fit
,
having
regard
to
the time allowed for the
defendant
to
appear being
reasonable
,
and
to
the other
circumstances
of
the case
;
it
being also provided
and re-
quired
of
the
plaintiff that he prove the amount
of
the
debt
or
damages claimed by him
in
such action
,
either
before
a
jury
,
upon
a
writ
of
inquiry
,
or
before one
of
the
masters
of
the superior courts
,
in
the manner

or a judge may
direct , and the making
such proof is a
condition
precedent to his obtaining
judgment
(y) .
The
provisions in the Common Law Procedure
Act ,
1852 , for
meeting the
case of wilful
evasion of the service of the
writ of summons , and for
service
out of the jurisdiction ,
have taken the place of certain very technical proceedings
by distringas
to compel
an appearance, and outlawry
on
mesne
process , which have been
abolished
from
the time
of that Act (z) .
An absconding debtor may , however, still
be arrested under the stats.
1 & 2 Vict . c. 110 , and
14 &
15 Vict . c. 52 .
The
appearance to a writ of summons is made by de-
livering to the proper officer of the court a memorandum
in the form given by s . 31 of the Procedure Act of 1852 .
As regards appearance , it is noticeable that special pro-
visions are made by s. 33 of the above Act for proceedings
where only
some of several defendants
appear to a writ
specially
indorsed .
The plaintiff may either
sign judg-
ment against the defendants who have not appeared , and
issue execution against them , before declaring against the
defendants who
have appeared, in which case he will be
taken to have abandoned his action
against the latter , or
he may , before issuing
execution ,
declare against
those
who have appeared,
stating , by way of suggestion , the
judgment
against those defendants who have not appeared ,
in which case the judgment so obtained against the defen-
dant
or defendants
who have not appeared will operate
and take
effect in like manner as a judgment
by default
obtained
against
one or more of several defendants in an
action of debt before the commencement of the Act.

at the trial a joint contract by all the defendants in the
action (i. e. , both those who have and those who have not
appeared) , and if he fail to do so , the verdict at the trial
will be against him, and he cannot have execution
even
against those who have let judgment
go by default .
The
foregoing observations are made without
reference to the
exercise of the
power of amendment
which
may or may
not , under
the
circumstances
of the
particular
case
be
exercisable for curing a misjoinder of the parties .
With regard to the joinder of parties in actions we may
observe
as
follows :
The
non -joinder
or
misjoinder
of
plaintiffs
and the misjoinder of defendants used formerly ,
before the Common
Law Procedure
Act of 1852 ,
very
frequently
to give rise at the trial of a cause to objections
which
were fatal to proceedings on the part of the plain-
tiff, so that he entirely
lost
his action , and had his own
and the defendant's
costs
to pay after all the
expenses
had been incurred preparatory to the trial, and the main
expenses
of the trial itself.
Though
the same principles
must in general be applied now as formerly for determin-
ing who
ought
and who
ought
not to be joined
in an
action , yet for remedying the mischief
above
adverted to ,
powers of amendment
(before
or
at the trial)
of non-
joinder
and misjoinder
are provided by ss . 34 & 35 of the
Common Law Procedure Act , 1852 (b) , accompanied with
limitations
and conditions guarding
against injustice being
done to any party by reason of their exercise.
Before entering further on the course of proceeding
in
an action , the different
forms of personal
actions may be
shortly noticed .
We have
seen
that it is
no
longer
necessary to mention
any form of action
in the writ of
(b) And see the further
provisions
of the Com . Law Proc . Act,

bringing
actions in the
names of all the
persons in whom
the legal right may be supposed
to
exist ;
and

being
given for one or more of the plain-
tiffs by whom the action is brought

summons , and in the statements of causes of action given
by schedule (B. ) of the Act of
1852
as examples of the
mode of preparing
such statements no mention whatever
is made of any form of action , and this harmonises with
those provisions of the Act which allow of different causes
of action being joined
in the same . suit (c) without
refer-
ence to the forms of action to which they belong .
Formerly
it was matter of great importance , and sometimes of great
nicety , to select the form of action
applicable
to the par-
ticular
cause of action sued
on , and not to include in the
same action causes of action belonging
to different forms ;
and an error in that respect might have proved fatal to the
proceedings on grounds quite beside the real merits of the
case .
The remedial provisions of the Common Law Pro-
cedure Act , 1852 , have on that head practically
removed
any danger of an action being defeated
on grounds purely
(c) By the C. L. Proc . Act, 1852,
s. 41, " Causes of action , of what-
ever kind , provided
they be by and
against the same parties and in the
same rights , may be joined in the
same suit ;-but this shall not
ex-
tend to replevin
or ejectment
; and
where two or more of the causes of
action so joined are local , and
arise
in different counties , the venue may
be laid in either of such
counties ;
but the court or a judge
shall
have
power to prevent
the trial of diffe-
rent
causes of action
together , if
such
trial
would
be
inexpedient ,
and in
such
case such
court
or
judge may order separate records to
be made up, and
separate trials to
be had ."
The
above
provision
that
the
causes of action must be against the
same parties and in the same rights
goes to the character
in which the
plaintiff or defendant sues or is sued
-not to the form of action -for in-
stance, an executor or administrator
cannot sue in the same action for a
claim in his representative
capacity
jointly with one which is quite ir-
respective of it, and which he makes
in his own right, ex. gr., he cannot
join a claim
for
the price
of goods
sold bythe testator
or intestate with
a claim for the price of his own goods
sold by himself, neither
can he be
sued in the same action for money
lent to the testator
or intestate
and
for money
lent to himself.
There
is, in the same act, a special
clause
(s. 40) as to joinder
of claims by hus-
band
and wife with claims in right
of husband
for injury
done to the
latter.
Where
the injury
which
the wife
complained
of was
some
bodily injury , and a bill was incur-
red for medical attendance , the hus-
band
had to sue separately for the
expenses incurred , but now he need
no longer do so.

technical .
But though
forms
of action
are
no longer
a
part of the visible machinery
in the writ and pleadings ,
and are no longer allowed
to intervene
as an element of
mischief in the proceedings in an action , they
are still
retained
so far
as they are beneficial , and are frequently
referred to
in
arguments
relating
to
legal
wrongs
as
throwing
light
upon
the
question
whether
on a given
state of facts there
is any remedy or right of action
at
law.
The forms of the ordinary personal actions are assumpsit ,
debt,
covenant,
trespass,
case ,
trover ,
detinue ,
and
replevin .
Assumpsit
lies
for the breach of a contract
not under
seal ; it sounds in damages , that is , it is essentially
an
action for damages , but these may include
a liquidated
as
well as an unliquidated
demand .
Thus
assumpsit
might
be brought
simply for the price of goods sold , in
which
case
the
price
to
be paid
measures the damages to be
recovered ; or it might be brought
for breach of a war-
ranty where the damages
are necessarily left at large , and
must be assessed
on evidence of circumstances which show

Debt is an action to recover a liquidated
or certain sum
of money owing from one man to another
whether
on a
specialty (c) , or by simple
contract (d ) , or statute ( e), or
(c) A debt by specialty , or

a

of

strument

a covenant , and the like ; on failure
of which the bond becomes forfeited
and the debt becomes due in law.
(d ) A
debt by simple
contract
is where the contract
upon which
the obligation
arises
is neither
as-
certained
by matter
of record , nor
yet by deed or special
instrument ,
but by mere oral evidence , the most
simple
of any ;
or by writing un-
sealed, which is capable of a more
easy
proof ,
and
therefore
better ,
than a mere verbal promise .

record (ƒ) , and lies wherever there is
a direct and imme-
diate liability to pay .
The action of debt does not sound
in damages , the recovery of the debt, qua debt , being the
main
object of the action , though nominal
damages may
be given
for its detention-and sometimes damages
more
than
nominal
may in respect of such detention
be re-
covered ;
for
example , in those
cases
where
interest ,
though
not
reserved
in the contract
out of which the
debt
arose ,
is
by law
allowed .
It has
been
observed
that in debt the liability to pay must be immediate
and
direct , and on this head nice distinctions
prevailed .
It
was held , for
example , that
debt would
not
lie
on a
collateral
covenant to pay a sum of money on default of
another
person , but that it would
lie
on
an
absolute
covenant to pay a sum due from another person (g).
Dis-
tinctions
of this kind still
exist in theory , but can no
longer , as we have already seen , be made use of to prevent
the determination of the case on its real merits . In either
of the
above
instances the
question would
now simply
able by statute , debt
may be made
applicable
either
for the party
ag
grieved , or for the plaintiff in the
action , or for the
crown
and the
plaintiff.
Further,
an
action
for
damages may sometimes lie against
the
hundred
or
other
district in
which an offence occurred , with a
view
to enforcing
compensation
to
the plaintiff who
has been damni-
fied thereby .

(f) A debt of record is a sum of
money which appears to be due by
the evidence of a court
of record .
Thus, when any specific
sum is ad-
judged to be due from the defendant
to the plaintiff in an action
or suit
at law ; this is
a contract
of the
highest
nature ,
being
established
by the sentence
of a court of judi-
cature .
A debt
upon
recognisance
is also a sum of money , recognised
or acknowledged
to be due to the
crown
or a subject , in the presence
of some court or magistrate , with a
condition
that
such
acknowledg-
ment
shall
be void
upon
the ap-
pearance
of
the
party, his
good
behaviour ,
or
the like :
and this ,
like the old
statute -merchant
and
statute -staple , &c., if
forfeited
by
non -performance
of the condition ,
is also ranked
among the first and
principal
class of debts , viz., debts
of record ;
since
the
contract
on
which it is
founded is
witnessed
by the
highest
kind
of evidence ,
viz ., by matter of record .

be , has the
plaintiff stated
a good
cause
of action , no
matter
under what
form it ranges itself, entitling him to
recover ?
Covenant
lies
for breach of a covenant or agreement
under
seal .
The
action
sounds in damages ,
but , like
assumpsit , extends to
liquidated
as well as unliquidated
demands , and is a concurrent
remedy with the action of
debt for specific sums directly and immediately
payable
by the
covenantor
to the
covenantee
on
an
absolute
covenant to that effect.
Trespass , the nature
of which
has been already amply
exemplified , lies for an injury to person or property , where
such injury is
direct
and immediately
results
from
the
application of force .
The remedy in trespass
, however , is not confined to an
act of positive
violence , it extends to any wrongful
act
when force , in fact , is used , however slight it may be , or
however peaceably it may be exercised , provided the injury
result immediately
from it.
Case
is an
action
for
consequential
injury-that
is ,
injury arising
indirectly
and consequentially
from the act
complained of.
It was long since observed
(h) , by way of
illustrating the difference between trespass and case , that ,
" If a man throw a log into the highway , and in that act
it hits
me , I may maintain
trespass
,
because
it is an
immediate wrong ; but if, as it lies there , I tumble
over
it and receive an injury , I must bring an action upon the
case."
One or two instances in addition to those men-
tioned in preceding
pages may here be given illustrating
the nature and applicability
of this action .
Thus slander ,
whereby a person's character is injured , is the
subject of
an action on the
case , and
case would
be the remedy for
the wrongful
obstruction
of
a watercourse ,
where the
cause
of obstruction
was an erection
made on the
de-
fendant's
own land , so
as to indirectly
interfere with the

watercourse
on the plaintiff's
land .
Again , the
action
would be case where the defendant was sued
for an injury
inflicted
by the
careless
driving of his carriage by his
servant , the wrong complained of being the negligence of
the person whom he employed in the course of his employ-
ment , and the injury resulting
as a consequence from it.
Trover is a species of action on the case , and lies for the
wrongful
conversion of goods (i).
Detinue lies for the specific recovery of goods wrongfully
detained , and damages for their detention (k) .
Replevin
is an action attended with many peculiarities ,
which have already been treated of at length (7) , we will
here merely repeat that it is commonly resorted to where
goods have been wrongfully
taken under a distress , though
it has been held to apply to any unlawful
taking of goods
out of the possession of another (m).
After the defendant in the action has appeared
to the writ
formal pleadings preparatory to a trial commence.
These
pleadings
are alternate
statements , or counter allegations
in writing , relating
to the claim
on the one hand and the
defence on the other , and following
in succession , until
by means of them the questions to be decided between the
parties are brought
out in the form of issues, on which the
cause may be tried and decided.
The process
of pleading
is to compel
the parties to come to an issue of fact or of
law, and the rules of law directed
to the mode whereby
and the time within which these pleadings
or written
statements are to be made , irresistibly
lead the parties in
an action to raise the issues or questions to be decided
between them , unless , indeed , either party , at some pre-
liminary stage of the suit , chooses
to abandon his claim or
defence .
Formerly the system or science of special plead-
ing was one of great refinement ; its rise and progress have
been thus described (2) : " The manner of allegations

our courts may be
said to have
been
first
methodically
formed and cultivated
as a science in the reign of Edward
I.
From that time the judges
began systematically
to
prescribe and enforce certain rules of statement , of which
some had been established
at periods
considerably more
remote, and others apparently were then from time to time
first introduced . None of them seem to have been of legis-
lative
enactment ,
or to have had
any authority , except
usage or judicial regulation
; but from the perception of
their
wisdom
and utility , they acquired the character of
fixed and positive institutions , and grew up into an entire
and connected system of pleading ."
But though the sys-
tem of pleading
above
spoken of in terms of not unjust
eulogy was in some
respects
of great utility , and had been
a valuable auxiliary
in building
up and settling the law in
this country , yet it ran into such refinements and niceties ,
and was capable of being so much abused , for the purpose
of raising purely technical objections , that it was at length
deemed
expedient to effect
a complete change in its rules ,
and this was mainly
done by the Common Law Procedure
Act , 1852 , which , while it still retained what was useful
in pleading-viz ., the compelling
the parties in an action
to come to
issue, did
so by provisions which , to a great
extent , discarded
the refinements
and niceties
that had
prevailed , and were directed to matter of substance rather
than of form .
But though the more subtle rules of plead-
ing have been swept away , it is still only by controlling
the time and the manner of their allegations that the parties
in an action
are brought
to issue.
Under no system of
pleading could the parties be left at large without
control
to arrange the points of difference between themselves . If
they were so , specific issues would seldom be arrived at by
persons
in so hostile
a situation
as the plaintiff and the
defendant in a suit
at law.
The parties
are , however ,
under control , both as to the time and the manner of their
allegations , and are compelled by the system that prevails
in our courts of law so to plead that they must , sooner or


326

later , arrive
at
specific issues (n) .
Both the
manner
of
their allegations
and the time within which the parties are
to make them
are accordingly
regulated by law and the
practice of the
courts , and they
must
proceed in their
alternate
statements by certain
formal
stages , under the
cognisance and control of the court in which
the action
may be brought .
The plaintiff must , after the appearance
of the defendant
is entered , declare his
complaint .
To
this
declaration
of the plaintiff , the defendant , within a
certain time , unless he means to let judgment
go against
him by default , must plead . To this pleading the plaintiff
replies , and if either party unduly hesitates and delays to
plead , he may be ordered to do
so by notice (o), at the
peril of having judgment
signed against him, and
so the
parties proceed
in point of time .
Neither is the manner
of their allegations uncontrolled . Here steps
in the science
of special pleading , which
is part of the law, and by the
rules of which
the
parties
are constrained to limit and
point their allegations in such a way that , sooner or later ,
they arrive
inevitably
at specific issues , either of fact or
of law, at distinct
points
of dispute , whereby the cause
may be tried and decided .
The distinctive
names of the successive
steps in pleading
are
as follows :-The
statement
after appearance, of the
cause
or causes
of action
for which
the plaintiff
sues is
called the " declaration
;" the defendant's
allegations in
answer
to the declaration , the " plea ; " the plaintiff's
reply
to the
plea , the " replication " (p) .
To these
the
defendant
may rejoin , and the pleadings
may go beyond
this stage to surrejoinder , rebutter , surrebutter , &c. , accord-
ing to the exigencies of the
case , though
at the present
day issues of fact are generally arrived at by the replication.
or the rejoinder . If there are grounds for contending that

any one of these pleadings from the declaration downwards
is on the face of it substantially
defective, that is to say,
does not , on the facts as stated by it, present any real case
or any real answer to the pleading which it professes to
answer, such pleading
may be " demurred " (9 ) to, and
joinder in demurrer raises an issue of law, to be argued
before the judges .
A party, moreover,
may now
have
leave both to plead and demur to the same pleading (r) .
A leading alteration effected
in pleading by the Common
Law Procedure Act , 1852 , was its doing away with special
demurrers , and putting
in the place of them a more salu-
tary method of controlling
the statements of the parties .
Demurrers
were formerly divided into two classes , general
and special-general where the pleading demurred to was
defective in substance , special where the defect was one of
form only . If a party in his pleading infringed
any rule
as to the form of statement , however trivial or unimport-
ant such infringement
might be , he was
liable
at once to
be visited by a special demurrer
at the will of his
op-
ponent.
The main rules as to statement in pleading-for
example , those against uncertainty , argumentativeness , or
doubleness in
pleading-so far as they were applied
to
their
legitimate
objects , worked well and usefully
; but ,
unfortunately , the smallest infractions of any one of them ,
though not in the least impeding
the course of the cause ,
or in the least interfering
with a decision of it on the
merits , were perpetually made subjects of special demurrer ,
and , in addition to this , many fictitious
and needless
aver-
ments , which admitted of no denial , and on which nothing
turned , were required to be made, to satisfy some theory of
form only , which
had been established to be law.
Now,
the Common
Law Procedure Act , 1852 , retained general
(q) Demurrer , from the Latin de-
morari, to stay , the party who
de-
murs
objecting
to go any further ,
because
the
other
has
not
shown
sufficient
matter
against
him that
he is bound to answer .
(r) As to pleading
and demurring

s. 80.


328

demurrers , but put an end to special demurrers , substitut-
ing for them a controlling
power , vested in the court or
a
judge , to amend or strike out pleadings on the application
of the opposite party , if they were so framed as to prejudice ,
embarrass , or delay the fair trial of the action ; and as to
needless
and fictitious averments , the act swept them away
altogether .
We have been above speaking of those
general clauses
of the act relating
to all pleadings
at any stage of the
cause .
The act also contains
special provisions
relating
to particular
matters in pleading .
By the provisions
as
to the language
and
form
of
pleadings in general , the following
simplifications
amongst
others have been effected : statements which
need not
be
proved , such as the statement of time , quantity , quality, and
value , where these are immaterial , the statement of acts
of trespass having
been committed with force and arms ,
and against the peace of our lady the queen , the statement
of premises which
need not be proved , and all statements
of a like kind ,
are
to be omitted (s ).
Also either party
may object by demurrer to the pleading
of the
opposite
party that such pleading does not on the face of it set forth
sufficient
ground of action , defence , or reply , as the
case
may be ; and where issue is joined on such demurrer , the
court may proceed
to give judgment
according as the very
right of the
cause
and matter in law shall
appear unto
them
without
regarding
any
imperfection ,
omission ,
defect in
or lack of form , and
no judgment
shall be
arrested , stayed , or reversed for any such
imperfection ,
omission , defect in or lack of form (t).
No pleading shall be deemed
insufficient
for any defect
which could formerly have been taken by special demurrer
only (u).
If any pleading
be so framed as to prejudice , embarrass ,
or delay the fair trial of the action , the
opposite party
(s) C. L. Proc . Act , 1852, s. 49.
(t) S. 50.

329
may apply to the court or
a judge to strike out or amend
such
pleading ,
and the court
or
a judge
may
make
such order
respecting the same, and also respecting
the
costs of the application , as may seem
fit
(x
).
It should here be observed
that the Procedure Act of 1852
makes provision for the parties
to
an action raising questions
of
fact without any pleadings
,
if
they are agreed
as
to
the
question
or
questions
of
fact
to
be decided between
them
,
and this
is
to
be done after writ issued by order
of
a
judge
,
upon his being satisfied that the parties have
a
bona fide
interest
in
the decision
of
such question
or
questions
,
and
that the same
is
or
are fit
to
be tried
;
but
as
the basis of this
proceeding
is
the agreement
of
the litigant parties
as
to
what may be the question
or
questions
to
be
decided between
them
,
it
is
not
of
frequent occurrence
.
Provision
is also
made for the parties
in
an action by consent and order
of
a
judge
to
state any question
or
questions
of
law
in
a
special
case
for
the
opinion
of
the
court
without
any
pleadings
.
It
is
to
be observed
that
to
raise
a
question
of
law
in
a
special case the parties must agree
upon all the
facts
,
and
as
it
is
but seldom that the litigant parties can
do this
,
it
is
not uncommon for the
special
case
to
be
referred
to
some person
to
settle for the parties
,
he having
power to receive evidence and
to
determine
those facts
which
are
disputed
between them
(y
).
Provisions
are
likewise
contained
in
the Common
Law Procedure Act
,
1854
,
relating
to
compulsory
references
to
arbitration
by order
of
the court
or
a
judge
,
which have been found
most valuable
in
saving the time
of
the
courts
,
and re-
lieving the parties from unnecessary expense
(z).
An order
to
refer
,
though
it
may be made
at
a
subsequent stage
,
is
frequently
made before any pleading
in
the action
.
The
application
to
refer
is
open
to
either party
,
and the court
or
a
judge will make such order upon being satisfied that

the question in dispute involves wholly or in part matters
of mere account which cannot be conveniently
tried in the
ordinary
way.
The
time
within which
the parties
are compelled
to
proceed with their pleadings is governed by the provisions
of the Procedure Act of 1852 , and by the rules of practice
relating thereto ;
the general
principle
applicable
being
that either party can be forced on to take the next step in
pleading within a certain time , until issue joined , or must
abandon his claim or defence , as the
case may be.
The
plaintiff is deemed
out of court unless he declare within a
year
after the writ of summons
is
returnable , that
is ,
ipsofacto, without anything
being
done to force him
on
by the defendant ; but he may be compelled to declare at
an earlier
period , or submit
to
a judgment
against him
which puts an end to the action , and is called judgment of
non pros .
The plaintiff has the whole of the term next
after the appearance is
entered for declaring , but when
that
time
has expired , on four days ' notice being given
him , as prescribed by sect.
53 of the
Procedure
Act of
1852 , if he fail to declare within such period , judgment of
non pros may be signed against him unless
he
has
ob-
tained by judge's
order further time to declare.
A plain-
tiff may obtain further time to declare by order of the
court
or a judge on application
made for that
purpose , or
some order in the cause
may suspend the proceedings for
a time , and this
remark
applies
not only to declarations
but to all the subsequent pleadings
and to
each
party in
the cause, viz. , that the time may be extended expressly
or impliedly by order.
Application for time to plead and respecting very many
other
matters
incidental
to
the
proceedings
of
either
party in the cause are disposed of at judge's
chambers by
summons and order ; the
summons
is taken
out by the
party applying
and served on his
opponent , and in the
body of it requires him to attend before the judge to show
cause, ex. gr. " why the defendant
should
not
have a

week's
further
time to plead ," or
as the
case
may be.
These
summonses
are attended
at judge's
chambers
in
some
cases
before
a judge , in others before a master (a )
of one of the courts , and the order is drawn
up according
to the decision , which is usually indorsed
on the back of
the summons . In many cases the opposing party indorses
a consent
on the summons , in which
case
the
order is
drawn up without
attending
before the judge .
In order to force
on the opposite party (if he delay to
proceed) a notice must
now be given
requiring
him "to
declare, and reply , rejoin , or as the
case may be, within
four days , otherwise judgment " (b) .
Such notice is either
delivered separately or indorsed on the pleading
to which
the opposite party is required
to reply , rejoin , or otherwise .
The
regular
time
for
pleading in bar to the
action ,
where the defendant
is within the jurisdiction, is eight
days (c) , and in order to compel the defendant
to plead ,
a notice requiring
him to do so in eight days , " otherwise
judgment ," may , whether
the declaration
be delivered
or
filed , be indorsed on it, or may be separately delivered (d) .
A plea in abatement must be pleaded in four days .
There
are also rules
as to the time for pleading
after amend-
ment (e) ; where the amendment of any pleading is allowed
no new notice to plead thereto shall
be necessary
, but the
opposite party is bound to plead to the amended pleading
within the time specified in the original
notice to plead ,
or within
two
days
after
amendment ,
whichever
shall
last expire , unless
otherwise
ordered
by a court or judge ,
and in case the
amended
pleading
has
been
pleaded
to
before amendment
and is not pleaded to de novo within
two days after amendment
or within such
other time
as
may be allowed , the pleadings

shall
stand
and
be
considered
as
pleaded in answer
to
such amended pleading .
We have already seen that the plaintiff may have notice
given to him to reply , rejoin , or as the
case
may be , and
he must
do
so
on such notice
being
given him , unless
further
time
is
allowed
by judge's
order .
The
long
vacation , which includes
the time
between Aug.
10 and
Oct.
24 in
every year , is excepted from the
period
of
pleading .
As regards the
computation
of time-in all
cases in
which any particular
number of days not expressed to be
clear days is prescribed
by the
rules
or practice of the
court , the same are reckoned
exclusively
of the first day
and inclusively
of the last day, unless the last day shall
happen to fall on a Sunday , Christmas -day , Good Friday ,
or a day appointed
for
a public
fast
or thanksgiving
, in
which case the time is reckoned
exclusively of that day
also ;
the
days
between
Thursday
next
before
and the
Wednesday
next after Easter -day and Christmas -day and
the three following
days are
not reckoned or included in
any rules , notices , or other proceedings in general , except
notices of trial or notices of inquiry (ƒ).
In any cause in which
there have been no proceedings
for one year from the last proceeding
had ,
the
party ,
whether plaintiff or defendant , who
desires
to proceed , is
required
to give
a calendar
month's
notice to the other
party of his intention

however ,
the
pleadings
to
proceed , the

(as

in which the action
is
brought , and of the day and the

venue must
be stated in the margin , being
the county
where the action is to be tried .
A formal commencement
and a conclusion
are also prescribed for the declaration () .
The venue laid in the declaration is either transitory
or
local ; local where the
cause of action is of such a nature
that it could
only have arisen in a particular
place or
county ,
and
transitory
where it might have arisen
any-
where .
Thus , in an action for an injury to real property ,
the venue is local ; while
in an action for debt or breach.
of contract , which is
nullius loci ," and for an injury to
the person or personalty , it is transitory .
Such
is
the general
distinction
in
regard
to venue .
It should however be observed
that sometimes , though the
cause of action is fixed to no locality within the meaning
of the above
definition , the venue is nevertheless required
to be local , ex. gr. , where it is made so by statute . Where
the venue is transitory it may be laid in any county , sub-
ject to its being
changed by order of a judge
on special
grounds .
Where
local , it
must
be laid in the county
where the cause of action
arose , but the
court or a judge
may allow a suggestion to be entered for the trial of the
cause in a county
other than
that in which the venue is
laid.
After the formal commencement of the declaration , the
statement of the cause of action follows .
It is not , as one
unacquainted
with legal
proceedings
might
imagine , a
narrative of all the circumstances of the case out of which
the complaint
has arisen , but it is a statement of such
facts
only
as are essential to constitute
a cause of action
on the part of the plaintiff against
the
defendant .
In
pleading , the legal effect and operation of things is looked

at ; what is matter of evidence merely is reserved for the
trial, and all that is required in a declaration , therefore , is
that it should
state in an accurate and traversable (j)
manner
those facts which
constitute
the
cause of action
against the defendant .
This statement may be sometimes
made shortly
and in general terms with the aid of lan-
guage of legal import , and sometimes by a more extended
statement , but
should
always be made without
unneces-
sary detail or prolixity.
The following examples , to show the mode of declaring ,
may be adduced :—A merchant applies to a manufacturer
to supply him with cotton prints
;
a correspondence ensues
as to the price to be given for the goods , the quality of the
wares , the time during
which they are to be supplied , and
the period of credit to be allowed for payment .
The terms
of the
contract
are
at length
adjusted .
The goods are
sent
and received by the
merchant ,
and the
period of
credit has expired , but he fails to pay the price for them ,
and
an
action
is
commenced
against him.
Now the
cause of action
arising
out of
the
above
facts
would
be
briefly
stated in the
declaration
to be for " money
payable by the defendant to the plaintiff for goods sold
and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant ” ( k) .
this cause of action were denied , and the terms of the con-
tract were disputed , with a view to reducing
the amount
charged , or for any other
reason , the facts
and circum-
stances of the case , including
the
correspondence
, would
be proved at the trial , the
pleadings
presenting
in the
simplest
form the issue as to which
the evidence would
be given .
Again , a horse was sold at

or put in issue .
(k) The above belongs to a class
of counts called the common counts
or money
counts , of which several
examples are given in Schedule (B. )
to the Com . Law Proc . Act, 1852.
If

They used to be called
the " inde-
bitatus counts ," because they begun
by stating
that

defendant

the words ".money payable

substituted .

in the course of which the seller said that the horse was
sound , and quiet
to ride .
Now every affirmation
at the
time of the sale of a personal chattel is a warranty , pro-
vided it be so intended , and whether it was so intended or
not , in the
case
put , would be a question for the jury on
evidence of the circumstances
attending
the
sale , and of
what
then
took
place
between the parties ; the buyer ,
however , in suing the seller for breach of warranty , would
in his
declaration
simply
state
that the defendant by
warranting
a horse to be then
sound and quiet
to ride ,
sold the said horse to the plaintiff , yet the said horse was
not then sound and quiet to ride ," it being for the jury to
decide , if the
warranty
were
denied by
an
apt
plea ,
whether the statements made by the seller at the time of
the sale were intended as a warranty
or not .
Again , plaintiff
sues
defendant
for
not
loading
the
plaintiff's ship pursuant to a charter -party .
Such a case
might involve
many
details ,
yet
the
statement of the
cause of action
would
be
made in the following form ,
without any superfluous
narration :-" That the plaintiff
and defendant agreed by charter -party that the plaintiff's
ship , called the
' Ariel , ' should with all convenient
speed
sail to R. , or so near thereto as she
could
safely get , and
that the defendant should there load her with a full cargo
of tallow or other lawful
merchandise , which
she should
carry to H. , and there deliver , on payment of £-— per
ton , and that
the defendant
should be allowed ten days
for
loading , and ten for discharge , and ten
days for de-
murrage if required , at £—
per day, and that the plain-
tiff did all things
necessary on his part to entitle him to
have the agreed cargo loaded on board the
said ship at
R. , and that the time for doing
so had elapsed , yet the de-
fendant made default
in loading
the agreed cargo ;" the
terms set forth in the declaration corresponding with those
of the charter -party .

above
forms of declaration

for wrong , independent
of
contract .
In an
action
for
diverting
a watercourse from a mill , the declaration might
allege : " That the plaintiff was possessed
of a mill , and
by reason thereof was entitled
to the flow of a stream for
working the same , and the defendant , by cutting
the bank
of the said stream , diverted
the water thereof away from
the said mill ."
It is impossible
to read the
above
form
without
perceiving
that it is framed with the extremest
brevity , and so as to invite clear and simple issues
on the
main
points likely to arise in such an action ;
as for in-
stance , on the
pleas of not guilty , and
a denial of the
right asserted by the plaintiff, and , issues being joined
on
these pleas,
a mass of evidence, oral
and documentary ,
reserved for the occasion when it could be once for all
best investigated , viz . , on the trial of the cause , might be
forthcoming .
Statutory
forms ( ) such
as the
foregoing , which
are
models of clearness
and comprehensive
brevity , should
always be followed , as far as the particular
circumstances
of the case may admit . It is , indeed , expressly provided (m)
that they shall be sufficient , and may be used, with need-
ful modifications . Sometimes , however , it may be advisable
to plead at length , instead of using a more concise form .
Thus it is an old rule of pleading
that the legal operation
and effect of a written instrument
should
be
stated , but
there are cases in which it may be advisable to set out the
whole instrument in words and figures from the beginning
to the end ; for instance , a deed may , if a particular con-
struction is put upon it , give the plaintiff a cause of action
against the defendant , and the construction of any part of
the
deed
may depend on a nice
consideration
of all its
terms .
The plaintiff in such case may think proper to set
out the whole deed , whatever be its length , in his pleading ,
in order to bring it at once before the court , and thus give
the defendant an opportunity
of raising
the question by

(B. ).


AN

337
demurrer , whether on a true construction of the deed there
is a cause of action or is not .
The declaration must omit no allegation that is material
to the cause
of action .
Thus
a declaration
against
a de-
fendant for breach of a contract by him to do certain work
for the plaintiff in a careful and proper manner , would , if
the contract
were not under
seal , be bad in substance ,
unless it stated a consideration for the defendant's under-
taking .
One or two remedial
provisions
relating
to declarations
may here specially
be noticed .
A difficulty
in pleading
formerly existed in declaring on the breach of an executory
contract , from the necessity of stating the fulfilment or an
excuse for the non-fulfilment
of every condition precedent
to the defendant's obligation
to perform it.
Now, it was
often difficult to say whether
particular
stipulations
were
conditions
precedent or not , and especially where no stress
had
been laid upon them
as such between
the
parties .
In
declaring
for
breach of a contract
containing
many
clauses , and having
long
specifications
attached to it, it
was necessary to pick out of the contract every stipulation
that might be held to be a condition precedent, whether it
concerned an act to be done, an act to be omitted , or an
event to happen , and precisely and separately to aver the
performance of it, or an excuse
for its non -performance .
Hence
much
perplexity
was sometimes
caused , and , to
remedy the evil adverted to , it has been provided that " it
shall be lawful
for the plaintiff or defendant in any action
to aver performance of conditions
precedent generally , and
the opposite party shall not deny such averment generally ,
but shall specify in his pleading the condition or conditions
precedent , the
peformance of which
he intends
to con-
test " (n).
Again, formerly in an action for libel and slander , where
the words or matter
complained
of were actionable only
(n) C. L. Proc . Act, 1852, s. 57.
VOL . III.

with reference to extrinsic
circumstances , it was
necessary
to state such extrinsic
circumstances in the declaration by
way of prefatory
averment .
It was often a difficulty
to
know how much or how little to state of the circumstances ,
or in what way to put them , as a matter of pleading , to
support the inuendo or meaning
attached to the words or
matter
in a subsequent
part of the declaration . If the
prefatory averment did not support the meaning attached ,
with almost logical exactitude , the whole declaration might
have been held to be bad.
To remedy this
s . 61 ( 0) of the
Common Law Procedure Act , 1852 , has enacted that , " in
actions for libel and slander , the plaintiff shall be at liberty
to aver that the words or matter
complained of were used
in a defamatory
sense , specifying
such defamatory
sense
without
any prefatory
averment to show how such words.
or matter
were used in that
sense , and such averment
shall be put in issue by the denial of the alleged libel or
slander ; and where the words or matter set forth , with or
without
the alleged meaning , show a cause of action , the
declaration shall be sufficient ."
Inasmuch
as each of the money counts (p) is worded in
very general terms , and may include
several transactions.
(for instance , the count for " goods sold " may relate to
several sales of goods ) , it is
deemed
proper that the de-
fendant should be informed as to the items of the plaintiff's
claim , and the plaintiff, accordingly , is required to deliver
or file with every declaration (q) , unless the writ of sum-
mons has been specially indorsed , full particulars
of his
demand
under
such
claim (r) .

statutory provisions
in certain
other
cases
as to particu-
lars ; and particulars , also, may be obtained
by means of
a judge's
order, on special grounds , in cases where they
are not ordinarily given .
Though several causes of action may be conjoined in one
declaration , the court or a judge has power to strike out
or amend, on application
made for that purpose , counts
founded on the same cause , and thus to prevent a useless
and inconvenient repetition of the same grounds of claim ,
with
a difference of form merely .
Indeed , the rules of
Trinity Term ,
1853 , make
express
provision
against
the
unnecessary repetition , not only of counts , but of pleas
and
subsequent
pleadings .
Thus ,
reg.
1
directs
that
(except
as
afterwards
provided ) several
counts
on
the
same cause of action shall not be allowed , and any count
or counts used in violation of this rule may , on the appli-
cation of the party objecting , within a reasonable time , or
before an order made for time to plead, be struck out or
amended by the court or a judge , on reasonable terms .
Reg. 2 also provides that " several pleas , replications , or
subsequent pleadings , or several avowries or cognizances ( s)
founded on the same ground
of answer or defence , shall
not be allowed , provided
that ,
on application
made to
strike out any count , or objection
taken to the allowance
of
several pleas , replications , or
subsequent
pleadings ,
avowries , or cognizances , as being in violation of this rule ,
the court or judge may allow such of them , though founded
on the same
ground of answer or defence
as may appear
to be proper for determining
the real question in contro-
versy between the parties , on its merits , subject to reason-
able terms ."
Moreover , " when on the trial of a
cause
(no rule or order having been previously made as to costs)
there is more than
one count , plea , replication , or subse-
quent
pleading , avowry , or
cognizance , on
the
record

founded on the same
cause of action , or ground of answer
or defence , the judge
before whom the
cause is tried may
certify to that effect
on the
record , thereby making
the
party who has
so pleaded liable
for the
costs
thus
use-
lessly incurred (t) .
Pleas
are
either in abatement
or in bar ;
a
plea
in
abatement
does
not
profess to answer the claim
on
the
merits , but seeks
to abate the action
on the ground
of
some defect or informality
in its inception , which
disen-
titles
the plaintiff to
sue .
The only
plea in
abatement
much
known in practice is that of non -joinder of
co-
defendants . If such a plea were well founded , it formerly
had the effect of quashing the writ and declaration in the
particular
action .
It gave the names of those who ought
to have been joined
as defendants , and the plaintiff had to
commence a fresh
suit
against all who should
have
been
joined .
It was accordingly
said to give the
plaintiff
a
better
writ .
Now,
however ,
statutory
provisions
have
rendered it unnecessary to commence the action de noro
after
a successful
plea
of
non -joinder-the
writ
and
declaration
being
amendable by inserting
in them the
names of the defendants who ought to have been originally
joined (u).
The
plea in
abatement
has
to
be
verified
by affidavit , and must
state that the person
or persons
whose
non-joinder
is
pleaded
are
resident
within
the
jurisdiction
of the court , and the place of residence
must
be
stated
with
convenient
certainty
in
the
affidavit
verifying
the plea .
Pleas in bar are pleaded to the plaintiff's claim on the
action .
They
may
seek to
meet
the
cause
of
action
allowed in the declaration either by denial or by some other
(t) Rules Trin . T. 1853, reg. 3.
The C. L. Proc . Act, 1852, enacts
(s.
86), that all objections
to the
pleading
of several
pleas,
replica-
tions ,
or subsequent
pleadings ,
or
several
avowries or cognisances , on
the ground
that they are founded
on
the same ground
of answer or de-
fence, shall be heard upon the sum-
mons to plead several matters .

answer , showing
that
the plaintiff has no right to main-
tain the action against the defendant .
Pleas in bar are
broadly divided into pleas in denial and pleas in confession
and avoidance .
Such
a plea may deny or traverse one or
more of the material
allegations
in the declaration , or it
may admit
the
case
as there
stated , and bring forward
new matter
in
answer to it.
Let
us suppose that the
plaintiff, the drawer of a bill of exchange, declared against
the defendant
as acceptor of the bill .
A plea that he (the
defendant ) did
not
accept
the bill would
be a plea in
denial or traverse of the
acceptance as alleged .
A plea
that
before
action
the
defendant had satisfied and dis-
charged the plaintiff's claim
by payment would be a plea
in
confession
and
avoidance .
The
latter
plea
would
admit the bill to have been accepted
by the
defendant ,
and that a complete
cause
of action had accrued against
him , but would avoid it by matter
subsequent , viz ., pay-
ment in discharge .
It is
not , however ,
essential
to
a
plea in confession and avoidance that it should admit a
cause of action
to have
once
accrued .
If the plea admit
the prima facie
case
stated
in the declaration , it would
still be so designated , although the new matter
brought
forward by it should
go to show that there never was a
cause
of action
against the
defendant
in respect of the
matter
declared
on .
Thus , in
an
action
on
a bill
of
exchange , if the defendant pleaded that it was
given
for
an illegal consideration
(stated in the
plea), that would
confess the drawing
and
acceptance
, but show the bill to
have been invalid
ab initio , as between drawer
and ac-
ceptor .
In an action
for
diverting
a watercourse , were
the
defendant
to
plead
not
guilty
and
also
that the
defendant diverted the watercourse in the lawful exercise
of a prescriptive right at particular
times to irrigate
his
meadow, the first plea would be that form of denial called
the " general issue ," while
the
second
plea would
be in
justification
of the act complained
of, and show that no
cause of action had ever existed in
respect of it ; still it


342
PROCEEDINGS

would
admit
the
diversion
in point
of
fact ,
and
be
described
as
a plea in confession
and avoidance .
At
a
period now somewhat remote (u) , such justification
could
have been given in
evidence
under
the
plea of " not
guilty," or " the general issue."
With regard to the " general issue ," some explanation
may here be proper .
The term is still in use , though the
operation and effect of the plea was greatly limited by the
rules of Hil . Term , 4 Wm . 4 , and again by the rules
of
Trin .
Term ,
1853.
In form
the
general
issue
may
perhaps be described
as
a denial of such allegations
as
constitute
the
characteristic
or
leading
feature
of the
claim .
Thus , in " promises " it would be " non assumpsit ,"
in
case
and
trespass, " not
guilty," in
detinue , " non
detinet ." " Nil debet " was formerly the general issue in
debt , but is now no
longer
allowed (r).
The evidence
admissible
under the general issue , or in other words , the
defences
let in by it formerly
varied in extent in different
actions ; in the majority of cases , however , this
plea had
the
effect not
only of denying
the
facts
stated
in the
declaration , but of letting in evidence appropriate
to pleas
in confession and avoidance. It is needless
to particularise
with precision
what
was admissible
under
the
general
issue before the
rules
of Hil . Term , 4 Wm. 4,
as its
operation is now
regulated
by the rules of Trin . Term ,
1853 , from
which
the
following
propositions
with ex-
amples and illustrations
of them have been taken :-
1. In any action on simple contract (except as presently
specified) the plea of non assumpsit , or a plea traversing
the
contract
or
agreement
alleged
in
the
declaration ,
operates
only as a denial in fact of the express contract ,
promise , or agreement alleged in the declaration , or of the
matter of fact from which it may be implied
by law (y).
Ex. gr. In an action on a warranty
such plea will operate
(u) Namely , before the Rules , Hil.
Term , 4 Will. 4.
(x) Rules , Trin . T. 1853, reg. 11.
(y) Reg. 6.

343
as a denial of the fact of the sale and warranty
having
been given , but not of the breach ; and in an action on a
policy
of insurance
of the subscription
to the
alleged
policy
by the defendant , but not of the interest , of the
commencement of the risk, of the loss , or of the alleged
compliance with warranties (z).
In an action against
a
carrier
or other bailee for not
delivering
or not
safely
keeping
goods , or not returning
them
on request , and in
an action against an agent for not accounting , such plea
will operate as a denial of any express or implied
contract
to the effect alleged in the
declaration , but
not of the
breach .
To any cause of action to which the plea of " never was
indebted " is applicable (a) , and to any of a like nature ,
the plea of " non assumpsit " is now inadmissible , and the
plea of " never was indebted " operates
as
a denial
of
those
matters
of fact from
which
the
liability
of the
defendant arises ; ex. gr . , in an action for goods bargained
and sold , or sold and delivered , the plea will operate
as a
denial
of the
bargain
and
sale , or
sale
and delivery in
point of fact ; in an action for money had and received it
will operate
as a denial both of the receipt of the money
and of the
existence
of
those
facts
which
make
such
receipt
by the
defendant
a
receipt
to
the
use
of the
plaintiff (b).
In an action
upon
a bill of exchange
or promissory
note, the plea of " non assumpsit " and " never indebted "
is inadmissible .
In any such action , therefore , a plea in
denial
must
traverse
some
matter
of fact ;
ex. gr. , the
drawing , making , indorsing , accepting , presentment ,
or
notice of dishonour of the bill or note (c).
2. In every species of action on contract , all matters in
confession and avoidance , including
not only those by way
of discharge , but those which show the transaction
to be ,

credit , unseaworthiness
,
misrepresentation ,
concealment ,
deviation ,
and
various
other defences
must be pleaded (d).
3. In an action on a specialty or covenant , the plea of
" non est factum " operates as a denial of the execution of
the deed in point of fact only , and any other defence
must
be specially
pleaded, including
matters which
make the
deed absolutely
void
as well
as
those
which
make
it
voidable (e).
In such an action matter in confession and
avoidance must also be pleaded specially (ƒ) .
4. In an action for tort , the plea of not guilty operates
as
a denial
only of the breach of duty or wrongful
act
alleged to have been committed by the defendant , but not
of the facts stated in the
inducement , and no other de-
fence than such denial is admissible
under that plea ; all
other pleas in denial must take issue on some particular
matter of fact alleged in the declaration (g).
Ex .
Ex. gr., in
an action for a nuisance to the occupation of a house by
carrying
on an offensive trade , the plea of not guilty will
operate as a denial
only that the defendant carried on the
alleged
trade in such a way as to be a nuisance to the
occupation of the house, and will not operate as a denial
of the plaintiff's occupation of the house.
In an action
for obstructing
a right of way , such plea will operate as a
denial of the
obstruction
only , but not of the plaintiff's
right of way.
In an action for slander of the plaintiff in
his office , profession , or trade , the plea of not guilty will
operate in denial of speaking the words , of speaking them
maliciously , and in the defamatory
sense
imputed , and

with reference
to the plaintiff's office , profession , or trade ,
but it will not operate as a denial of the fact of the plain-
tiff holding
the office , or being of the profession or trade
alleged .
In an action for an
escape , the
plea of the
general
issue will
operate
as a denial of the neglect or
default of the sheriff or his
officers , but not of the debt ,
judgment, or preliminary
proceedings .
And in an action.
against a carrier , the
same
plea will operate as a denial
of the loss or damage , but not of the receipt of the goods
by the defendant
as a carrier for hire , or of the
purpose
for which they were
received
.
Thus
much
as to the
effect of the plea of not guilty
generally .
It may be proper to add that in an action for
trespass to land , this
plea
operates
as a denial
that the
defendant
committed
the
trespass
alleged in the
place
mentioned , but not as a denial of the plaintiff's
posses-
sion , or right of possession of that
place , which , if in-
tended to be
denied ,
must
be
traversed
specially (h) .
That
in an action for taking, damaging , or converting
the plaintiff's goods, the plea of not guilty operates
as a
denial
of the
defendant
having
committed
the
wrong
alleged by taking,
damaging ,
or converting
the goods
mentioned , but not of the plaintiff's property therein (¿).
And that in an action for detaining
goods , the plea of
non
detinet
operates
as
a denial of the detention of the
goods by the defendant , but not of the plaintiff's pro-
perty therein ; and no other defence
than such denial
is
admissible
under that plea (k).
A defendant sued in tort
is sometimes empowered by statute to plead the general
issue , and to give the special matter of defence in evidence
under it, and in any such case he is required to insert in
the margin of his plea a reference to the particular
enact-
ment
upon
which
he relies , otherwise
such plea will be
taken
not to have
been
pleaded
by virtue of any act of
parliament
;

memorandum

serted in the margin of the
issue and of the nisi prius
record ( ).
The nisi prius record is the record made upon
parch-
ment for the purpose of the trial , showing the pleadings
and issues joined , and delivered to the proper officer of the
court in which the cause
is to be tried .
5. In an action of tort, as in an action of contract , all
matters in confession
and avoidance
must
be
specially
pleaded (m ).
6. The last of the pleading
rules
to be here noticed ,
applies
to all
actions by and
against
the
assignee of a
bankrupt
or insolvent , or by an executor
or
adminis-
trator , or by a person authorised
by act of parliament
to
sue or be sued as a nominal
party , and directs
that the
character in which
the plaintiff or defendant is stated
on
the record to sue or be sued shall not in any such case be
considered as in issue unless specially denied (n).
In answer to the declaration , or other subsequent plead-
ing
of the plaintiff,
a
defendant
may ,
by leave
of
a
judge (0), plead as many several matters as he shall think
necessary for his
defence , upon an affidavit if required to
the effect that he is advised and believes that he has just
ground to traverse the several matters proposed to be tra-
versed by him, and that the several matters
sought to be
pleaded by him by way of confession
and
avoidance
are
respectively true in substance and in fact (p ).
In general ,
however , leave to plead several matters to the declaration
is allowed or disallowed by a judge on consideration of the
nature of the different
pleas
as appearing on the face of
them , no
affidavit

as

By sect . 84 of the Common Law Procedure Act , 1852 ,
the following pleas , or any two or more of them , may be
pleaded together as of course, without
leave of the court
or
a judge , viz. ,
a plea
denying
any
contract
or debt
alleged in the declaration ,
a plea of tender
as to part , a
plea of the statute of limitations

the

of, is the plaintiff's ,
leave
and
licence ,
son assault
demesne
, and
any
other pleas
which by rule or order may from time to time be added
to
the foregoing list.
Of the pleas above designated some few may be thought
to need a brief explanatory
notice . A plea of " the statute
of limitations " is applicable where the action has not been
brought within a certain time after accrual of the cause of
action , limited by statute ; for example , if the
action be
brought
on a simple
contract , such a plea would be that
the alleged cause of action did not accrue within six years
before suit ( ) ;
or, if on a specialty , not within twenty
years prior thereto (r).
The plea of "plene administravit "
is applicable where an executor or administrator
would set
up in answer to a claim against him that he has fully ad-
ministered
the
assets
of the testator
or intestate .
The
plea of " plene administravit
præter " applies
where this
defence
is relied
on by a personal
representative , that he
has administered
all but a certain
portion of the assets ,
the amount of which
he either
pays
into court or meets
by some outstanding
claim of a higher
nature than the
but there is a general
provision
ap-
plicable
both
to plaintiff
and
de-
fendant
that
the costs of any issue,
either
of fact
or law, shall follow
the finding or judgment
upon
such
issue .

plaintiff's .
The plea of son assault demesne is where the
defendant in an action for assault pleads that the plaintiff
first assaulted the
defendant , who thereupon
necessarily
committed the alleged assault in his own defence .
Payment into court is a plea of great practical import-
ance , and may be pleaded in any action except for assault ,
battery , false imprisonment , libel , slander , malicious arrest ,
malicious prosecution , or debauching the plaintiff's daugh-
ter or servant (s).
Various statutes specially
provide for
payment
into
court
in particular
cases ,
as for instance ,
under Lord Campbell's
Act ( 9 & 10 Vict . c. 93 ) , and 27
& 28 Vict . c. 95 , s. 2 , relating to actions for compensation
to the family of a person killed by accident .
Further,
a
plea of apology and payment into
court is allowed
under
6 & 7 Vict . c. 96, in certain actions for libel.
The Com-
mon Law Procedure Act , 1860 , s . 25 , also contains provi-
sions as to payment into court in actions on money bonds
and for detainer .
No other plea besides that of payment
into court
can , however , be pleaded with it to the
same
part of the declaration .
The plea of payment of money into court admits a cause
of action , and brings
the money into court in satisfaction
of the matter pleaded to.
The
practical
effect , however ,
of the plea of payment into court , as an admission , varies
very much with the nature and form of the declaration to
which it is pleaded .
For
example , to
a declaration for
breach of a contract , where the contract is specially
de-
clared on, it would
admit
the contract as stated, and the
breach to which it was pleaded ; but to a declaration
con-
taining the common
money counts ,
each of which
may
include several contracts under its general
terms , such as
money lent, goods sold , work done at different
times , the
plea of payment into court as to part of the money claimed
may be pleaded , and never indebted
to the residue ; the
effect of the admission by the former plea in such case not
(s) C. L. Proc . Act, 1852, s. 70.


AN ACTION

amounting
to more than that on some contract or other of
the kind mentioned in the declaration money is due to the
amount of the sum paid into court .
An indebitatus count ,
as we have
before
observed
(t), is not
necessarily
con-
fined to one contract , but may extend to an indefinite
number of contracts
between the parties
to the
action ;
and when , therefore , the defendant pays money into court
on such a count , he in effect says
to the defendant , I
admit that I owe you the sum paid
into
court upon some
contract which may be comprehended in your count , but
if you say I owe you
more
on any contract , prove that
contract .
So payment
of money into court to a declara-
tion upon
a special agreement , admits
the contract and
the breach , for since the declaration contains but one con-
tract , the payment into court must admit that contract by
which alone anything
is claimed to be due from the defen-
dant to the plaintiff (u).
So in an action of tort the declaration may be so framed
as to make a payment of money into
court an admission
of the particular
cause of action sued for, and also of the
breach .
The
payment of money into
court in
such an
action may, according
to the form of the declaration , be
subject either to the rule
applicable
to special contracts ,
or to the rule applicable to the general indebitatus counts ,
as above stated.
Application
to plead several matters is made by taking
out a summons before a judge at chambers , calling
on the
plaintiff to show cause why the defendant
should
not be
at liberty to plead
the several matters annexed , and an
abstract of the proposed plea is annexed to the summons .
The same method is pursued
in asking for leave to plead
or demur , and also as to the
subsequent pleadings where
several matters have to be replied , and so forth.

actions at law by the Common
Law Procedure Act , 1854.
By sect . 83 of that act, it is lawful for a defendant or the
plaintiff in replevin
in any
cause
in which , ifjudgment
were obtained , he would be entitled to relief against such
judgment
on equitable
grounds , to plead the facts which
entitle
him
to such relief by way of defence , and such
defence may accordingly
be received by way of plea , pro-
vided that it begin with the words " for defence on equi-
table
grounds ," or words to the like
effect .
Sect .
84
relates to grounds
of equitable
defence
arising after the
period
for pleading
has
elapsed .
Sect.
85
relates to
equitable replications , and sect. 86
provides
that in case
it shall appear that
any such equitable plea or equitable
replication
cannot be dealt with by a court of law, so
as
to do justice between the parties , the same may be struck
out , on reasonable terms .
As regards the construction of the above sections it is
now settled that the plea setting up a defence
on equitable
grounds must
state such
facts
as would
entitle
the de-
fendant to an unconditional
injunction
in equity , that is to
say, he must show such
a case as would induce a court of
equity
at
once
unconditionally
to restrain
the plaintiff
from
proceeding
at law.
The
object of the enactment
which gave effect
to equitable pleas in a court of law was
to enable a defendant instead of filing
a bill in equity to
restrain
the plaintiff from
proceeding
at law, at once to
plead the matter which would have entitled
him to equit-
able relief, as an answer to the action .
But one of the
earliest restrictions
imposed on the use of equitable pleas
by the courts of law was that , unless the effect of the plea
was to furnish a complete answer to the action
and ter-
minate the litigation
, it should not be allowed (v).
The replication
follows
the plea ; and at this
stage of
the proceedings
issue is very commonly
joined
between
the parties-either issues of law, of fact , or of both.
(v) Wakley v. Frogatt , 2 H. & C. 669.


AN ACTION
AT LAW.
351
An issue in law is arrived
at by joinder in demurrer ,
the demurrer stating simply that
the declaration " is bad
in substance ; " in the margin of his demurrer the plaintiff
has , however , to specify some substantial
matter
of law
intended to be argued , and if he omit to do so , or if the
ground stated be frivolous , the demurrer may be set aside .
Supposing
the demurrer
to stand , the joinder of demurrer
would be to the effect that the pleading
demurred to " is
good in substance ," and would complete the issue of law
to be tried by the court (x).
Joinder of issue of fact may be effected
by either party
pleading in answer to the plea or subsequent pleading
of
his
adversary
that
he joins
issue thereon (y) , and such
form of joinder of issue is to be deemed
to be a denial of
the substance of the plea or other subsequent pleading and
an issue thereon , and in all
cases
where the plaintiff's
pleading is in denial of the pleading
of the defendant or
some part of it, the plaintiff may add a joinder of issue for
the defendant .
A party is not , however , obliged in pro-
ceeding to issue
to deny the
whole
of his adversary's
pleading ;
he may , if he prefers it, traverse separately
any material allegation
in such pleading
(≈) .
We have before said that an issue of fact is commonly
arrived
at by the
time
the
replication
is
reached , the
plaintiff
joining
issue
on
the
pleas ;
but it
may
be
requisite
for the
plaintiff's
case (and the same remark
would
apply
to either
party
at any of the
subsequent
pleadings ), that he should reply in confession and avoid-
ance of the plea instead of joining issue ; and to a plea in
confession
and
avoidance
the defendant
would
have
to
rejoin , or the plaintiff might desire to join issue, or sepa-
rately
to traverse one or more material
allegations
in the
plea, and
also
to reply
in
confession
and avoidance , in
which
case he would
have to obtain
leave of a judge for
that purpose .

reply to several matters in the following
case : suppose an
action to be brought
for goods sold and delivered by the
plaintiff to the defendant , and the defendant
to plead that
at the time of making
the
contract
he was
an infant
within the age of 21
years , and suppose the defendant at
the time of the action brought to be of age, and that it is
doubtful
whether he was not so at the time of making the
contract , such question might be raised by the plaintiff's
joining issue on the plea.
But the plaintiff may also have
grounds
for contending
that if the
defendant were
an
infant at the time of the contract , the goods supplied were
necessaries
for the defendant
suitable to his then estate,
degree , and condition , and in such
case he would reply
in confession and
avoidance of the plea
that
they were
such necessaries
(a) .
Again , there may have been
before
action some correspondence between
the plaintiff and the
defendant after the defendant came of age, and it may be
a question on such correspondence whether
the defendant
has not ratified
the contract , in which
case
the plaintiff
would wish to plead also that the defendant
after he had
attained
his full
age of 21 years and before action , by a
writing made and signed by him , ratified
and confirmed
the said contract .
These replications
containing
distinct
grounds of answer to the defendant's plea , would
no doubt
be allowed almost as of course
on the plaintiff taking
out
a summons
calling
on the
defendant
to
show cause why
he should not be at liberty to reply the several matters
specified in the abstract
annexed to the summons , and
such abstract might
be in this form :
1. Joinder of issue ;
2. That the goods were necessaries
;
3.
Ratification
of the
contract by the defendant after he came of age.

progress of a cause

to the discovery and
inspection
of documents and
the delivery of written
interrogatories .
A power to order
inspection
of documents
was sometimes
exercised by a
court of law before the
passing
of the statute
14 & 15
Vict.
c.
99 ,
but
by
s .
6 of that
act it was extended
to all
cases in which
equity would
order
a discovery , it
being thereby provided
that the court or a judge might ,
on application
made for
such purpose by either of the
litigants , in an action
or other
legal proceeding , compel
the opposite party to allow to the
applicant
an inspection
of all
documents in his
custody
or under
his
control
relating to the action .
Such power being
exerciseable in
all cases in which , previous to the passing of that act, a
discovery might have been obtained by filing a bill , or by
any other proceeding in a court of equity at the instance
of the
party
making
the
application .
The
provisions
referred to , it must
be
observed , do
not give
power to
compel discovery , but are confined
to inspection merely ;
they were, however , shortly
followed
by those contained
in
sect .

of the
Common

Act ,

enacting that , upon the application of either party to any
cause

proceeding
in any of the superior
courts , upon an affidavit by such party of his belief (b) that
any document to the production of which he is entitled for
the purpose of discovery or otherwise is in the possession
of the opposite party , the court or a judge may order that
the party
against
whom
such application is made , or if
such party is a body corporate , that some officer thereof
shall
state on affidavit what documents are in his or their
possession or power relating
to the matters in dispute , or
what
he knows
as to the custody of them , and whether ,
and if so , on what grounds , the production

to,
and thereupon
the court
or judge may
make
such
further order as shall be just .
The above enactments being directed to the compelling
of inspection of documents upon the grounds which would
move a court of equity to order it, we may add that
the
right of a plaintiff in equity is limited , first , to a discovery
confined to questions in the
cause , i.e. of such material
documents as relate to the proof of his
(the plaintiff's )
case on the trial , and does
not extend to the discovery of
the manner in which the defendant's
case is to be esta-
blished , or to evidence which
relates
exclusively
to his
case .
The party applying , therefore , to a court of law for
an order to inspect , who is in the same situation
as a
plaintiff in equity , must show , first , what
is the nature of
the suit , and the question to be tried in it ; and it seems
also that he should depose , in his affidavit , to his having
just ground to maintain
or defend it : secondly , the affi-
davit ought to state, with sufficient distinctness , the reason
of the application , and the nature of the documents , so
that it may appear that an inspection of the documents is
asked for the purpose of enabling the applicant to support
his own case , not to find a flaw in that of his opponent ;
and so that the opponent may admit
or deny the posses-
sion of them .
To this affidavit the opponent may answer ,
by swearing that he has no such documents , or that they
relate exclusively
to his own
case , or that he is , for some
sufficient reason, privileged
from producing
them ; or he
may submit
to show parts , covering
the remainder , on
affidavit
that the
part
concealed
does
not in any way
relate to the plaintiff's case (c).
As
ancillary
to
the
procedure
by
action
must
be
mentioned the statutory provisions
concerning interroga-
tories (d ). A litigant party may now be entitled , by order
of the court or a judge , to deliver to the opposite party or

his attorney (provided such party , if not a body corporate ,
would be liable
to be called and
examined
as a witness
upon such matter ) , interrogatories
in writing upon
any
matter as to which
discovery may be sought , and require
such party , or, in the case of a body corporate , any of the
officers of such body corporate , within ten days to answer
the questions put by affidavit , to be sworn and filed in the
ordinary way (e).
The application
for leave to deliver in-
terrogatories is usually disposed of on summons
before a
judge
at chambers , who , on production
of the proposed
interrogatories when the summons is heard , determines in
the first instance whether
they are such as ought to be
allowed or not .
The courts have a general discretion
as to the allowance
of interrogatories , though they will be guided in exercising
it bythe principles
on which discovery is allowed in equity .
Much doubt has however existed as to whether interroga-
tories can be put the
answers to which might tend to
criminate
the
party
interrogated .
The only
intelligible
rule upon the subject deducible from the cases seems to
be, that when the interrogatories
are bonâ fide framed for
the purpose of discovery , and are relevant to the matter
in issue, they may
be allowed , although
the
answers to
them may , if answered in one way , tend to criminate the
party
answering ,
leaving
to
such
party
the
option
of
refusing to answer upon that ground .
But where such
interrogatories
are sought to be put , the court or the judge
at chambers will require
a stronger
case
to be made out
for allowing
them
than is ordinarily
requisite , and such
interrogatories will
not be allowed
on the common
affi-
davit only , but some special
circumstances
must be laid
before the judge to induce him to order them (f) .

a cause on issues of fact (f). If there is an issue of law , it is
set down for argument at the request of either party , and
the demurrer book containing
the demurrer , the joinder in
demurrer , and the pleadings to which
they relate , has to
be made up and
delivered to the judges
as prescribed by
the rules of practice (g) , and the
case then
comes
on for
argument in due course before the court .
In the case of
issues of fact , the plaintiff makes up " The Issue ," as it is
termed , in the form (h) given by the practice rules , which
states
the issuing
and date of the writ of summons , and
contains a copy of all the pleadings , with their dates , con-
cluding
thus : " Therefore
let a jury come."
If there
are issues of law as well
as of fact , they
also are copied
into the " Issue " as well as the other pleadings , as the
jury may have to
assess
damages upon them.

The Nisi Prius Record is a transcript of all the pleadings ,
in fact
a copy of the " Issue ,"
made on parchment
( 1) ,
for the purposes of the trial, and delivered
to the proper
officer of the court in which the cause is to be tried .
When the trial is impending , the parties prepare and
arrange their proofs , oral and documentary , which , as the
law of
evidence
is
extensive
and
difficult ,
often
need
anxious consideration .
The ordinary
process
by which the
attendance of a witness
is
secured
is called a writ of sub-
pœna ;
or, when the witness
has documents that he is
required to bring with him , a subpoena duces tecum .
Some-
times the examination of a witness in a certain emergency ,
for example illness , or his having
to leave the
country ,
or being resident abroad , is taken before the trial under
the provisions of statutes directed
to that object (m), and
these depositions are read at the trial should he be unable
to attend .
Notice
to admit and produce documents is also
usually given , according as they may be in the possession
of the respective parties .
Where a document
is in the
possession of the party seeking
to put it in evidence , he
usually gives his adversary notice in a certain prescribed
form to admit it (n ) : this is done to
save
costs , if the
document
be admitted , or to throw the
costs of proof on
his
adversary , in
case
of his refusing
or neglecting
to
admit it.
Should
a document which
the party seeks
to
put in evidence be in the possession of his adversary , the
party needing it must give his adversary notice to produce
it , in order to let in secondary evidence of its contents at
the trial, if he then refuses to produce it.
Our law most
properly requires the document itself to be produced , un-
less there are sufficient
grounds for receiving
evidence of
its contents aliunde ,-as , for instance , refusal by one of
c. 22 ; 6 & 7 Vict . c. 82 ; 22 Vict .
c. 20.

the parties , in whose possession
it is , to produce the docu-
ment after notice to produce it .
We may add that the parties
to an action , except for
breach of promise of marriage , or for
a penalty
or for-
feiture
under
any law relating
to the
customs
or land
revenue, are competent and in most cases compellable
to
give evidence in the cause (o).
Supposing the nisi prius record to have been delivered
and the cause
entered , it will be called
on for trial ac-
cording to the position which it may occupy in the list ;
and the associate
or officer of the court who performs that
duty will proceed to empannel the jury from the jurors in
attendance .
It may be premised
that a copy of the jury
panel
signed by the sheriff
is annexed to the nisi prius
record at the
assizes .
The jury process
was greatly sim-
plified
by the provisions
of the
Common Law Procedure
Act , 1852.
In ancient
times , when
an issue in fact was
raised between the parties
to an action at law, the trial
took place in term time at the bar of the court itself.
It
was also required that the issue should
be tried by a jury
of the county in which
the cause of action
arose , and the
writs went to the sheriff to bring the jurors from thence to
Westminster
.
The stat . 13 Edw .
1 , c. 30 gave justices of
assize who tried real actions in the various counties power
to hear
and determine
other issues besides those in real
actions , and the writs then ran to the sheriff
to have the
jurors at Westminster
, nisi prius , " unless before " that
time the justices
of assize came
to the place where the
cause was intended
to be tried
at
a certain time , and as
this
was
practically
always
the
case , it was for
such
time and place that the jury were in fact summoned , and
then
and
there
the
cause
was tried .
Hence
arose
the
term " nisi prius
nisi prius "
as
applied
to the
ordinary
mode of
trying causes
as distinguished
from trials at bar ; other
statutes followed
relating
to this
process, and until the
(0) 6 & 7 Vict . c. 85 ; 14 & 15 Vict . c. 99 ; 16 & 17 Vict . c. 83 ; 17 &
18 Vict . c. 122.

passing of the Common Law Procedure Act , 1852 , various
writs to the sheriff , containing
more or less reference to
the ancient
practice , were in use ; but by that Act theso
writs , viz. , of venire facias juratores , distringas juratores ,
and
habeas
corpora
juratorum
,
and
the
entry
jurata
ponitur in respectu
were
rendered no longer necessary(p ) ,
and the jury are now summoned for the trial of issues
at
the assizes by the sheriff pursuant
to a precept from the
judges
of assize, and for the trial of causes
in
London
and Middlesex
pursuant to a precept under the hand of a
judge of any superior court.
The Act also contains pro-
visions by which
either plaintiff or defendant may apply
to obtain
a special jury — that
is, a jury
drawn
from
a
higher class than an ordinary
or common jury .
The cause being called on , the jurors , twelve in number ,
are sworn (9) ; and it is at this
particular
juncture
that
either party may exercise a right of challenge , which is of
two kinds — a challenge
to the array or to the poll .
The
former occurs where exception is taken to the principle
on
or means by which
the jury has
been
procured , as where
the sheriff has not chosen the jurors impartially ; challenge
to the poll occurs where exception
is taken
to individual.

of the four following
grounds :

of the jurors be an alien
or an infant, or have not the
qualifying
estate ; 3. propter
affectum
or partiality
; and
4. propter
delictum , on account of crime .
The qualifi-
cations of jurors , and the exemptions from serving in that
capacity (r), are mainly
regulated by 6 Geo. 4 , c. 50.

rate or inhabited
house duty in Middlesex
on a value of
not less than
301. , or in any other county on a value of not
less than 20%. , or who occupy a house containing
not less
than fifteen windows , are qualified and liable to serve. In
London
a juror must be a householder , or the occupier of
a shop, warehouse , counting - house , chambers , or office for
the purpose of trade or commerce within the said city , and
have lands , tenements , or personal estate
of the value of
100 %.
The persons exempted from serving are principally
as
follows :
peers , judges ,
clergymen ,
Roman
Catholic
priests , and dissenting
ministers , serjeants and barristers
at law, doctors and advocates of the civil law, attorneys ,
solicitors , proctors ; members of the College of Physicians ,
or College of Surgeons in London , Edinburgh , or Dublin ;
certificated
apothecaries , officers
in the navy or army
on
full
pay ,
licensed
pilots ,
household
servants
of her
majesty , officers of customs and excise ; sheriff's
officers ,
high constables, and parish clerks .
Persons described in the jury list as esquires , or of higher
degree , or as bankers or merchants , are qualified and liable
to serve on special juries , subject , of course , to the exemp-
tions from serving which are of general application .
The jury having
been sworn , the junior counsel for the
plaintiff
states
shortly
the nature of the pleadings , and
the
issues
of fact
which
the jury
are
to
try.
This is
termed " opening the pleadings ."
After this , the leading
counsel for that party to the cause who has the right to
begin states with more or less
of detail the circumstances
out of which
the claim
arises , or
on which
the defence
rests .
The right to begin , involving
as it does in most
cases the right to reply , is regarded as a valuable privilege ,
and is frequently in cases where it is at all doubtful
made
the subject of a contest at the outset of a trial , in which
case the presiding
judge
has to determine
the question
before the trial can proceed .
The
party
on whom
the
burthen of proof rests is in general entitled to begin , and
usually the burthen of proof in the first instance is on him

361
who affirms , and not on him who denies .
One method of
determining
the right to begin is by ascertaining
against
whom the verdict would
be
entered if no evidence were
offered on either side : the party against whom the verdict
would in such case be entered
would be entitled
to begin .
It may be, however , that , though
the affirmative
of the
issue or issues joined in the cause lies on the defendant ,
yet the plaintiff is entitled
to begin , ex. gr. , where the
plaintiff claims unliquidated
or unascertained damages
, he
is the party to begin .
Again , where there is no plea in
denial of any part of the declaration , but the damages
are
left at large , and it is for the plaintiff in the opening of
his
case to show what they are , he is to begin .
Thus , in
an action
against an employer for the wrongful
dismissal
of the plaintiff from his service , where the defendant does
not
deny
either
the employment
or
the
dismissal , but
pleads only a justification
of the dismissal on the ground
of the misconduct of the plaintiff, the affirmative of the
issue joined on such plea lies on the defendant ; neverthe-
less he has not in such case the right to begin , because
the plaintiff must in the first instance give evidence
of the
damage which
he has sustained .
With regard to the speeches
of counsel , each
side is
allowed to address the jury , setting forth the nature of the
claim or defence , and after the evidence in support of the
claim
or
defence
is
concluded ,
to make another
speech
summing up the evidence given (r). If the defendant call
witnesses , the plaintiff
does
not
sum up his
own
evi-
dence at the
end of his (the plaintiff's ) case in the first
instance , but
after
the
defendant's
evidence has
been
given
and summed up , the plaintiff
discusses the
case
and evidence in what is called the speech in reply .
The
evidence
and
the
speeches
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiff and defendant being
concluded , the judge sums
up the evidence on both sides, commenting upon it as he
(r) C. L. Proc . Act, 1854, s. 18.

proceeds, and directs the jury as to what are the disputed
facts they have
to determine , giving
them
at the
same
time
such
directions
as
may be
needed
concerning
the
law.
Thus, in an action against an infant within the age
of twenty -one years for goods sold and delivered in which
issue has been joined
as to whether
the goods supplied
were
necessaries
, the judge
would
state to the jury the
legal meaning of the word " necessaries
," and having thus
defined the law,
leave
them to determine
whether the
particular
goods
were
necessaries or not (s).
Again , in
an action for the price of goods sold
or for money lent ,
the defence might
be founded on the Statute of Limitations
(21 Jac.
1 , c. 16 ) , and issue having
been joined
on such
plea , the plaintiff might rely on an acknowledgment
in
writing under
Lord Tenterden's
Act (9 Geo. 4 , c. 14) to
take the
case
out of the
statute .
Assuming that
the
original
cause
of action
did
not
accrue within
the
six
years limited
by the statute of James I. , and the written
document to have been proved , it would
be for the judge to
direct
the jury as matter of law that it was or was not a
sufficient
acknowledgment
to
take the
case
out of the
statute (t).
Not only has the judge
to determine the right to begin ,
if disputed , but from first to last during the progress of a
cause his is the controlling
power which guides the legal
conduct of the
case , and directs it to its proper conclu-
sion (u). Who has the right to begin ; on whom the burthen
of proof rests ; what is material in the issues
to be tried ;
what of the evidence tendered is admissible , and what is
not ; and all directions and definitions of the law necessary
to enable the jury to deal with the issues, or to properly
estimate the damages ; in short , all questions of law as

distinguished
from questions of fact are for the judge .
It
is true , also, that long
experience and a matured judg-
ment will often enable him to point out to the jury , greatly
to their advantage , the bearing
and weight
of different
parts of the evidence
on matters
purely of fact , and even
to present his own view of the general
result of the evi-
dence
on the
merits of the
case , but this is never done
without his at the same time
explaining
to the jury that
the questions of fact are entirely for their
determination ,
the judge's views being given only in aid of their discharge
of that duty .
After the summing up of the judge , the jury give the
verdict , which is usually a general verdict , for the plaintiff
or defendant , upon the several issues.
Sometimes , how-
ever , the verdict
is a special
one , finding certain facts , so
that the court in banco may afterwards determine the legal
effect of such finding .
Further , it sometimes happens that
the trial
comes
to a close without
the verdict of a jury
being given .
The defendant's counsel may submit to the
judge that there is no question for the jury , that the plain-
tiff has not made out a prima facie case .
If the judge is
of that opinion , he intimates
that the plaintiff should be
non-suited , that is, be adjudged to have abandoned his
action .
The effect of a nonsuit is to put an end to the
particular
action and to cast upon the plaintiff the defen-
dant's costs
as well as his own , but it leaves him at liberty
to bring a fresh
action for the
same
cause
on a future
occasion , should
he be so advised .
Now as abandonment
is a voluntary
act, a plaintiff cannot be nonsuited against
his will , but inasmuch
as , if he persist in having the case
brought to the jury , under the direction of the judge , the
verdict will most
likely be against him, and would for
ever exclude him, supposing the judge's
direction to be
right , from bringing another action
for the same cause ,
he in general assents , in the case put , to be nonsuited . If
the judge insists on nonsuiting
a plaintiff against his will ,
or misdirects the jury , should the case be left to them , his

Proceedings

ruling is open to be reviewed , and a new trial may be had.
It does doubtless
occasionally happen that
a cause being
called
on , and the jury sworn , the plaintiff is nonsuited
simply
because
he
fails
to appear , and
thus , in
fact ,
abandons his case .
Frequently
, also , after the
cause
has
been entered , and the trial is about to take place , and even
after the cause is called on , but before the jury is sworn ,
if the plaintiff, finding that , through
the absence
of wit-
nesses
or for
other reasons, he is not ready to proceed ,
withdraws
the record ; the
consequence
of which
is , that
he has to pay the defendant's
costs of the day , but may
re-enter the cause for trial .
Other
instances
may be put
of the trial coming to a close
without
a verdict
on the
merits . A juror may be withdrawn
by consent ; this sub-
stantially
puts
an end to the
action , because
the court
would
interpose
to stay proceedings where , after such
a
step taken by consent of both parties , either side attempted
to bring it on again .
Or the judge
may discharge the
jury from giving a verdict where he finds there is no pro-
bability that
they will agree .
This leaves the
case open
to be brought on again for trial before another jury .
Or
the cause may be referred
to arbitration
; in such case a
formal verdict for the plaintiff is usually taken by consent ,
subject to the reference , the arbitrator
having power given
him to direct that a verdict shall be entered for the plain-
tiff or the defendant , or a nonsuit
be
entered
, as he shall
think
proper .
There is a common form for an order of
reference at nisi prius, containing
many stipulations
which
have
been
found
to be useful ,
and which
are usually
adopted by the parties .
Sometimes the order of reference
is by consent extended beyond the determination
of the
cause
itself, to all
matters
in
difference
between the
parties .
Where , however , the cause is tried out , and the verdict
given in the usual way , the litigation does not always end
thereby.
In very many cases questions arise at Nisi Prius
which call for consideration by the courts at Westminster ,


AN
ACTION
AT LAW.
365
after the trial is over, before final judgment
either on one
side or the other can be obtained . If, for example , there
are grounds
for contending
that
the judge at Nisi Prius
has mistaken the principle of law applicable to the case in
submitting
the facts to the jury , or has erroneously ad-
mitted or neglected evidence given
or proffered by either
of the parties , his ruling
may be
reviewed , either
on a
motion for a new trial , which is made in the court in which
the action was brought , or by a bill of exceptions tendered
at the trial by the party dissatisfied with the ruling .
By
this latter course
the case is at once
taken
to the court of
error .
The statute 13 Ed .
1 , c. 31 , first enabled the par-
ties to take the opinion of a court of error on the ruling of
a judge at Nisi Prius, and provided
that the party dis-
satisfied with his ruling might tender to the judge a bill
of exceptions , setting forth the exceptions taken , to which
the judge is bound to affix his seal .
The bill of exceptions
is then annexed to , and becomes
part of, the record .
The
court
of error
gives judgment
upon
the
whole
record ,
affirming
or reversing the ruling of the judge ; and if the
ruling be reversed a trial de novo is awarded, and the case
is again tried .
Error in law properly
so called
lies
for
errors apparent on the record , and those only , and it was
not till recently that means were provided , in addition
to
the power of tendering
a bill of exceptions , and taking the
ruling of the judge directly
and
at
once
to the court of
error , of appealing to the court of error against the decision
of the court in which the action was brought , on an appli-
cation for a new trial , or for leave to enter a verdict or a
nonsuit
on a point
reserved.
This power was given by
the
Common
Law Procedure Acts , and now in any case
of a rule to enter a verdict or nonsuit upon a point reserved
at the trial , if the rule
( v) to show cause
be refused , or
(v) A rule to show cause is com-
monly termed a rule nisi , because it
becomes absolute , " nisi" " unless "
cause is shown .
On
cause being
shown , the court
either
discharge
the rule
or
make it
absolute ,
as
they may think fit.

granted and then discharged , or made absolute , the party
decided against may appeal (x). And in any case of a motion
for a new trial
upon the ground
that the judge has not
ruled according to law, if the rule to show cause be refused ,
or, if granted , be then discharged
or made absolute , the
party decided against may appeal , provided any one of the
judges dissent from the rule being refused , or , when granted ,
being discharged or made absolute , as the case may be ; or,
provided the court in its discretion think
fit
that an appeal
should be allowed
;
provided
,
however
,
further
,
that where
the application for
a
new trial
is
upon matter
of
discretion
only
,
as
on the ground that the verdict
was against the
weight
of
evidence
or
otherwise
,
no such appeal
shall
be
allowed
.
The
court
of
error
,
the
exchequer chamber
,
and the house
of
lords
,
are
courts
of
appeal for the pur-
poses ofthe act
.
An instance
may
be given
in
which
leave might be
moved for
to
enter
a
verdict
or
a
nonsuit
on
a
point
reserved
.
Suppose
it
to
be clearly established on the facts
proved during the progress
of
a
trial
,
that the liability
or
non

liability
of
the defendant depends
on the construction
and legal effect
of
a
written
instrument
proved
to
have
been executed by him
;
the fact
of
the execution would be
matter for the jury
,
its
construction
and legal effect for
the judge
.
In
such
case
the
course might
be
for the
judge
to
give his opinion
on
the point
,
and the verdict
would be entered

has been taken by surprise . A new trial is not granted on
the ground
that
the verdict is against the weight of evi-
dence where the amount of damages or matter in dispute
is less than 20 %. , and there is no right in question beyond
the right to recover damages .
Neither
is it granted unless
it appear that the jury have come to a wrong conclusion
on the facts before them .
There must be at least a strong
preponderance of the
evidence
against
their
finding to
induce the court to interfere , it being the province of the
jury , not of the court , to appreciate the evidence given at
the trial .
These observations
as to a verdict against evi-
dence will apply
to the
motion
for
a new trial
on the
ground
that the damages are excessive (y) , the
amount
of damages to which the party is entitled being peculiarly
within the province of a jury .
Should the court think that
the damages
awarded are somewhat excessive
, it may inti-
mate that the rule will be made absolute unless the plaintiff
submits to accept a reduction then suggested , and such an
intimation
is usually
acted
on to save
further
litigation
and
expense.
As
an instance of misconduct
of a jury
affording
ground
for
a new trial , may be mentioned the
case of their drawing
lots for the determination
of their
verdict .
A new trial
on the ground
of surprise is only
granted
under very special circumstances , as
where the
party applying
for it has, through
some fraudulent
trick
on the part of his adversary , or in some other way , without
fault of his own , been wholly surprised by the evidence
given , and had no opportunity
of meeting it at the trial.
The usual time (2) at which
execution may issue where
the verdict is not disturbed
and judgment follows thereon ,
is fourteen
days from the verdict , unless the judge who
tries the

without terms .
Before , however , giving an account
of
execution , some
other proceedings
besides
those
already
noticed , that may intervene
before
final judgment is ob-
tained , may properly be mentioned .
It
First , then , as to entering judgment
non obstante veredicto ,
and motion in arrest of judgment .
Where the defendant
has succeeded
at the trial , and obtained
a verdict in his
favour , on a plea which
confesses
the cause of action , but
does
not show any sufficient
answer to it, the court will
give judgment for the plaintiff " non
obstante
veredicto ,
" notwithstanding
the verdict ."
So when on the face of
the record it appears that the plaintiff has no right to
recover, judgment
may be arrested on motion made by the
defendant for that
purpose ; but
these
applications
after
trial are
at the present
day comparatively
unusual .
seldom now happens that substantial
defects
on the face
of the pleadings are passed
over without demurrer , it being
open to the parties to plead and demur at the same time.
Moreover , on motion in arrest of judgment , or for judg-
ment non obstante
veredicto , by reason of the non -averment
of some
alleged material fact or facts of material
allega-
tion or other cause , the party whose pleading is alleged or
adjudged to be therein defective may , by leave of the court ,
suggest the existence of the omitted fact or facts , or other
matter which , if true , would
remedy the alleged defects :
and such suggestion
may be pleaded to by the opposite
party within eight days after notice thereof , or such further
time
as the court
or
a judge
may allow, proceedings for
trial of any issues
joined
upon such pleadings
being the
same as in ordinary
actions (a) , and judgment
follows the
result of the suggestion .
There is this further
check also
against
a party lying by for the purpose of taking advan-
tage after verdict
of defects
in the pleadings :
that the
costs of abortive issues , upon which his adversary has suc-
ceeded at the trial , are thrown upon him, it being expressly
(a) Com . Law. Proc . Act, 1852, ss. 143, 144.


AN

369
provided (b) that upon an arrest of judgment , or judgment
non obstante
veredicto , the court shall adjudge to the party
against whom such judgment
is given the costs occasioned
by the trial of any issues of fact arising out of the plead-
ings for defect of which such judgment
is given , and upon
which such party shall have succeeded .
With regard to time ,
a motion for
a new trial , or to
enter a verdict or nonsuit , motion in arrest of judgment ,
or for judgment non obstante
veredicto , cannot be made
after the expiration of four days from the day of trial , nor
in any
case
after the expiration of the term , if the
cause
were
tried in term , nor after the expiration
of the first
four days of the ensuing term if the
cause
were tried out
of term , unless entered
in a list of postponed
motions by
leave of the court (c).
Error lies , after final judgment
has been obtained , to
reverse
a judgment
on the ground
of some defect in the
proceeding , which renders it erroneous.
There is error in
fact and error in law, the former relating
only to the
case
where some fact not appearing on the record invalidates
the judgment on grounds of a technical
character , as for
instance , that the defendant , being an infant , appeared
by
attorney .
The grounds , however , on which
error in fact
may be brought
are few and of rare occurrence .
Error in
law is where , on the face of the record , it appears that the
judgment
was given
on insufficient
grounds , as that the
declaration
is insufficient in law to maintain
the action ,
and that judgment
ought to have been given for the defen-
dant instead of the plaintiff .
Error in law may , and not
unfrequently
does , follow upon
demurrer .
A
pleading
having
been demurred
to, and issue of law joined , and
judgment given , the unsuccessful party seeking to reverse
the judgment
of the
court
proceeds
in error with that
object .
Error lies on the judgment on a special verdict ,

and it also may be brought on a judgment
upon a special
case (d) in the same manner
as upon a judgment upon a
special verdict , unless the parties
agree
to the contrary ;
and the court of error may either affirm the judgment
, or
give the same judgment
as ought to have been given by
the court below , the said court of error being
required to
draw any inference of fact from the facts
stated in such
special case , which the court where the question was origi-
nally decided ought to have drawn (e).
No judgment
can
be reversed in error unless error be commenced within six
years after such judgment was signed or entered of record ,
except
where the
person entitled
to bring
error is at the
time such title accrues within the age of twenty - one years ,
feme covert , non compos
mentis ,
or beyond
the
seas , in
either of such cases extended time being given for action
in the
superior
courts .
The writ of error is no longer
necessary
or used
for
bringing
error ; the proceeding to
error is a step in the cause (ƒ) .
Error in fact has to be substantiated by affidavit , and is
brought in the court where the judgment
is given .
Error
in law is matter for argument
before the court of error .
Upon a suggestion (g) of error in law alleged and denied ,
the
cause is set down for argument , and the judgment
roll is without
any writ or return
brought by the master
into the court of error in the exchequer chamber , before
the justices , or the justices
and barons , as the
case may
be, of the other two superior
courts of common law, on

proceedings in error may be carried from
the exchequer
chamber
to the
high
court
of
Parliament
,
and
the
court of error
then hears and determines the case .
The
proceedings in error are regulated by provisions (?) of the
Common Law Procedure Act , 1852 , and the practice rules
of Hil . Term , 1853 .
Where
some ground of defence
against
proceeding on
the judgment
has
arisen
after judgment , this
may
be
made the subject of a writ of auditâ
querelâ, by which
a
defendant
seeks
relief from the
court by not having
the judgment
enforced against him.
No writ of auditâ
quereld,
however ,
can
be issued
without
leave of the
court
or
a judge (k) ,
and the use of this writ has in
modern
times
been in a
great
measure
superseded
by
application
on motion
to the court , on which , on sufficient
grounds , summary relief is granted .
Equitable
defences
arising after lapse of the period
during which they could
be pleaded may be set up by way of auditâ querelâ (1).
Final judgment
in the action
having
been
signed , exe-
cution
may
issue.
The ordinary
writs of execution , by
which
the
recovery of money (m) is enforced on a judg-
ment , are those of fieri facias , elegit , and capias ad satis-
faciendum ; they issue out of the court in which the record
is, and
are
directed to the sheriff of the county in which
the execution is to be had (n) .
The writ offieri facias (0)
commands the sheriff that he cause to be made out of the
goods and chattels of the judgment
debtor in his bailiwick
the amount
of
such judgment ,
together
with
interest
thereon at the rate of 47. per cent. from the day on which

judgment
was entered
up .
Not only what
are ordinarily
termed
goods
and chattels
may , with the exception of
wearing
apparel ,
be taken
under
this writ ,
but
leases
and terms of years , also money (p) , bank -notes , cheques ,
bills of exchange,
promissory
notes,
bonds ,
specialties ,
or other
securities
for
money belonging
to the person
against
whose
effects
it
has
been
sued
out ;
growing
crops (q) may also in certain
cases , and with some qua-
lification ,
be taken
under
it.
The time within
which
writs of execution
ordinarily
(r) bind
the goods is from
the time of their
delivery to the
sheriff to be executed ,
but persons acquiring title to goods
bona fide , and for
a
valuable
consideration , before the actual
seizure
under
the writ, and
without
notice
of the writ ,
are
protected
against the execution (s).
The
proceeding
on interpleader
may here be noticed .
By it relief and protection
are
afforded
to sheriffs
and
other officers when placed in a difficulty , arising
out of
the execution of process against
goods
and chattels , by
reason of claims
made to such
goods and
chattels by
assignees of bankrupts
and other persons , not being the
parties
against whom
such
process
was
issued.
Where
the sheriff
has
acted
bond fide and impartially
in the dis-
charge of his duties , and there is
a dispute
between
the
execution creditor on the one hand , and a stranger to the
action on the other , making
a claim to any goods or chat-
tels , taken or intended to be taken in execution under any
process , or to the
proceeds
or value thereof, they may be
called upon to appear before the court or
a judge , and
either to maintain
or relinquish
their respective claims or
try the same between themselves , one mode of doing which
is by proceeding
to trial under the order of the court on
(p) 1 & 2 Vict . c. 112, s. 12 ; and
see also ib. as to charging
stock in
the
funds
or shares in companies ,
by order
of a judge , though
they
cannot be taken in execution under
the writ.

an issue made up on the question of property , for deter-
mining to whom the goods belong .
Or the parties to an
interpleader may by consent have the merits of their claims
disposed of in a summary manner by the court or a judge ,
or that may be done even without
consent, at the request
of either party , wherever from the smallness of the amount
in dispute or the value of the goods
seized it appears to the
court or a judge right to order so .
The issue was formerly
termed " a feigned
issue," because it used to state that
a
wager had been laid between the two parties
respectively
maintaining
the affirmative and negative of the proposition
in dispute , but the act to amend the law concerning games
and
wagers , introduced
a simple
form
of issue
stating
merely that
one party affirmed
and the other denied the
fact to be put in issue (t).
It was probably deemed incon-
sistent that a form
founded on a supposed
wager should
be used to raise the issue, when by that statute no action
at law could have been maintained on such a wager had it
been a real instead of a fictitious
transaction .
Neverthe-
less , the use of the old form , though by practice supplanted
by the new one , is not positively interdicted by the statute
just referred to.
It may further be mentioned that relief by way of inter-
pleader could formerly only be obtained by a suit in equity ,
and it was the act
1 & 2 Will. 4 , c. 58 , commonly called
the Interpleader
Act , that first enabled courts of law to
give relief against adverse claims made upon persons having
no interest in the subject of such claims .
It extends not
only as we have mentioned
to the relief of sheriffs
and
other officers , but
to persons generally , when
sued at law
for the recovery of money or goods wherein they have no
interest (u).

suing
out the execution
is said to have chosen or elected
to
have that remedy
instead of the proceeding
by fieri
facias.
By the writ of
elegit the sheriff is commanded
that he cause to
be delivered to the judgment creditor by
a reasonable price
and extent the goods and chattels of
the judgment debtor (except his oxen and beasts of the
plough ) , and also such lands , tenements , rectories , tithes ,
rents , and hereditaments , including
lands or hereditaments
of copyhold
or customary
tenure ,
as the said judgment
debtor or any person in trust for him was seised or pos-
sessed
of on the day on which judgment (x) was entered
up , or at any time afterwards , or over which he on that
day had any disposing power which he might (without the
assent of any other person ) exercise for his own benefit to
hold the said goods and chattels , also to hold the said lands ,
tenements , rents , tithes , rectories , and hereditaments
re-
spectively , according to the nature
and tenure thereof , to
him and to his assigns , until the amount
due under the
execution be levied .
The sheriff's duty under this writ is
to impannel
a jury to inquire of the goods
and chattels of
the debtor , and to appraise them , and also to inquire
as
to his lands and their value , and the goods (if any) are to
be delivered to the execution creditor ; and if the value of
the goods is insufficient
to satisfy the execution , the legal
possession
or right of entry to the lands is delivered to the
execution creditor .
The writ
of capias
ad
satisfaciendum

the
sheriff to take the body of the judgment debtor , and him
safely keep , so that he may have his body to satisfy the
judgment
creditor

terest at
41. per cent . from the day on which judgment
was entered up .
The defendant
cannot be taken on a ca.
sa. in an action for the recovery of a debt wherein the sum
recovered does
not
exceed
20%. , exclusive of the
costs
of
such judgment .
We may here notice that by the Common
Law Proce-
dure Act , 1854 (y) , a new process of execution was given ,
in addition to the above , in actions in the superior courts ,
by the attachment of debts due to the judgment
debtor .
A judge may now make
an order that
debts owing
or
accruing from a third person to the judgment
debtor shall
be attached to answer the judgment
debt.
The third per-
son, or garnishee (2) , as he is termed , has full opportunity
given him under the provisions of the act for showing cause
against an order on him to pay such debt to the judgment
creditor , and his liability , if disputed , is tried in
a suit
instituted by the judgment
creditor against such garnishee ,
as prescribed by the act.
During the lives of the parties to a judgment
, execution
may issue at any time within six years from the recovery
of the judgment , without
a revival of the judgment . After
that period , or after a change by death or otherwise of the
parties entitled or liable to execution , before execution can
issue upon it, it must be revived by writ or with leave of
the court or a judge by suggestion (a).
Such is the ordinary
course
of an action at law as re-
modelled

Procedure
Acts and by the
Rules
of
Pleading

(b) In connection
with the fore-
going account of modern procedure ,
and
by way
of
contrast
with
it ,
some
notice
is here
appended
of
the
ancient
trial by wager
of bat-
tle , which was
abolished
by stat .
59 Geo . 3, c. 46.
This
method
of
deciding
a civil controversy
seems
to have owed its origin to the mili-
tary spirit of our ancestors , joined
to a superstitious
frame of mind :
it being in the nature of an appeal
to Providence , under
an apprehen-

sion
and hope
(however
presump-
tuous
and
unwarrantable
)
that
heaven
would give
the victory to
him who
had
the right.
The de-
cision
of suits by this
appeal
to
the God of battles
is by some said
to
have
been
invented
by the
Burgundi,
one
of the
northern
or
German
clans
who
planted
themselves
in
Gaul .
Yet it does
not
seem to
have
been
merely
a
local
custom
of this
or that par-
ticular
tribe ,
but to
have
been
the
common
usage
of
all
those
warlike
races
from
the
earliest
times
(Seld . of
Duels ,
c. 5).
It
may
also be inferred , from a pas-
sage in Velleius
Paterculus
(lib . 2,
c.
118), that the Germans , when
first they became known to the Ro-
mans , were wont to decide contests
of right by the sword :
for when
Quintilius
Varus
endeavoured
to
introduce
among them the Roman
laws
and
method
of trial , it was
looked
upon (says the historian ) as
a " novitas incognitæ disciplinæ , ut
solita armis decerni jure
termina-
rentur."
This trial
was
introduced
into
England
among other
Norman
cus-
toms
by William
the
Conqueror
;
but was only used in three
cases,
one military, one criminal , and the
third civil .
The first in the court-
martial , or
court
of chivalry and
honour
(Co. Litt. 261) ; the
second
in appeals of felony
(as to which
vide post, vol. iv. ) ; and the third ,
upon issue joined
in a writ of right,
the last
and
most
solemn
decision
of real property
(ante, p . 271) . One
pretext for allowing
it, upon these
final
writs of
right, was for the
sake of such
claimants
as
might
have the true right, but yet by the
death of witnesses ,
or other defect
of evidence , be unable
to
prove it
to a jury.
The last trial by battle waged in
the court of common
pleas at West-
minster (though there was afterwards
(Rushw . Coll. vol . ii. pt.2 , fol . 112 ;
19 Rym.322 ) one in the court of chi-
valry in 1631, and
another
in the
county
palatine
of Durham
(Cro .
Car . 512) in 1638) was in the thir-
teenth year of queen Elizabeth , A.D.
1571, as reported by sir James
Dyer
(Dyer, 301) : and was held in Tot-
hill Fields , Westminster
,
non sine
magnâ juris -consultorum
perturba-
tione ,"
says
sir
Henry
Spelman
(Gloss .
102),
who
was
himself
a
witness
of the
ceremony .
The
form , as appears
from the authors
before cited , was as follows
:-
66
When the
tenant
in
a writ of
right
pleaded
the
general
issue ,
viz., that
he
had
more
right
to
hold , than the demandant
had to
recover ; and offered to prove it by
the
body
of his champion , which
tender
was
accepted
by the
de-
mandant ; the
tenant
in the first
place produced his champion , who ,
by throwing
down
his glove
as a
gage or pledge , thus waged
or sti-
pulated
battle
with the champion
of the demandant
; who , by taking
up the gage or glove , stipulated
on
his
part
to
accept
the
challenge .
The
reason why it was waged by
champions , and not by the
parties
themselves , in
civil
actions ,
was
because, if any
party to the
suit
died , the
suit
must
have
abated ,
and
therefore
no judgment could
have
been given
for
the lands in
question , if either
of the parties
were slain in battle
(Co. Litt. 294 ;
Diversité
des
Courts ,
304) :
and
also that no person might claim an
exemption
from this trial, as was

377
allowed
in
criminal
cases,
where
the
battle
was
waged in
person
(post, vol . iv.).
A piece of ground
was then in
due time
set
out ,
of sixty
feet
square, enclosed with lists , and on
one side a court was erected for the
judges
of the
court
of
common
pleas, who attended
there in their
scarlet
robes ; and
also
a bar was
prepared
for the learned
serjeants
at law.
When the court sat, which
was properly
by sunrising , procla-
mation
was
made for the
parties
and their champions , who were in-
troduced by two knights, and were
dressed, each in a coat of armour ,
with red sandals , barelegged from
the
knee
downwards , bareheaded ,
and with bare arms to the elbows .
The
weapons
allowed
them were
only batons , or staves of an ell long ,
and a four-cornered
leather target ;
so that death very seldom occurred
in this civil
combat .
When the
champions ,
thus
armed with
ba-
tons ,
had arrived
within the lists
or place of combat , the
champion
of the tenant
took
his
adversary
by the hand , and made
oath that
the
tenements
in dispute
were not
the right of the demandant
; and
the
champion
of
the
demandant ,
then taking
the other by the hand ,
swore
in the
same
manner
that
they
were
each
champion
thus
professing
himself
to be thoroughly
persuaded of the truth of the cause
he
fought
for.
Next,
an
oath
against
sorcery
and
enchantment
had to be taken by both
the cham-
pions , in this or a similar form :
" Hear this,
ye
justices , that I
have this day neither
eat, drank,
nor
have
upon
me,
neither
bone ,
stone, ne grass ; nor any enchant-
ment , sorcery , or witchcraft , where-
by the law of God
may be abased,
or the law of the devil
exalted .
So
help me God and his saints ."
The battle was then begun , and the
combatants were bound to fight till
the stars appeared in the
evening ;
and , if the champion of the
tenant
could defend himself till the
stars
appeared , the tenant
prevailed
in
his cause ; for it was sufficient
for
him to
maintain
his
ground , and
make it a drawn
battle , he being
already in
possession .
But if the
victory
declared
itself
for
either
party , for him was judgment
finally
given .
This victory might
have
arisen
from
the
death of either
of
the
champions ,
which ,
however ,
rarely
happened ; the whole
cere-
mony , to say the truth, bearing a
near resemblance
to
certain
rural
athletic
diversions ,
which
were
probably
derived
from this
origi-
nal.
Or victory was
obtained , if
either
champion
proved
recreant ,
that
is ,
yielded ,
and
pronounced
the
horrible
word
" craven ,"
a
word
of disgrace
and
obloquy , ra-
ther
than
of
any
determinate
meaning .
But
a horrible
word it
indeed
was
to
the
vanquished
champion
since , as a punishment
to him for forfeiting
the land ' of
his principal by pronouncing
that
shameful word , he was condemned ,
as a recreant ,
amittere liberam
le-
gem, that is, to become infamous ,
and
not
be accounted
liber
et le-
galis
homo ;
being
supposed
by
the
event to be
proved
forsworn ,
and therefore
never to be put upon
a jury , or admitted
as a witness in
any cause.
Such was the form
of a trial by
battle ;
a trial which the
tenant ,
or defendant in a writ of right, had
it in his
election
to demand ; and

which was the only decision of such
writ of right after the Conquest , till
Henry II. by consent of parliament
introduced
the
grand
assize,
a pe-
culiar
species of trial by jury , in
concurrence
therewith
; giving the
tenant his choice of either
the
one
or the other .
The establishment
of this alternative , Glanvil (lib . ii.
c.
7,) chief justice
to Henry II.,
considered
as
a
most
noble
im-
provement of the law.
When compared
with a method
of
decision
so barbarous
as that
above described , the eulogies
often
and
lavishly
passed
on
our
trial
by jury would
scarcely seem to be
overstrained .
CHAPTER XIII.
INJURIES
PROCEEDING
FROM ,
OR
AFFECTING
THE
CROWN .
HAVING in preceding
chapters considered the injuries ,
or private wrongs , that may be offered by one subject to
another , and how they may be remedied , we proceed
to
inquire
as to the mode of redressing
those injuries
to
which the crown itself is a party : such injuries
are either
where the crown is the aggressor , or else is the sufferer ;
and these are usually remedied by peculiar forms of pro-
cess , appropriated to the royal prerogative .
We will here
consider the
manner : I. Of redressing
those wrongs
or
injuries which
a subject may suffer from the crown ; and ,
II. Of redressing those which the crown may receive
from
a subject .
wrongs in-
the crown.
I. That " the king can do no wrong ," is a necessary and Redressof
fundamental
principle of the English constitution : mean- ficted by
ing only, as was formerly
observed
(a) , that
in the first
place, whatever
may be amiss in the conduct of public
affairs is not chargeable personally on the sovereign ; and ,
secondly , that the prerogative of the crown
extends not
to do any injury ; for , being created
for the benefit of the
people, it cannot be exerted to their prejudice (b) .
When-
ever therefore it happens , that , through
misinformation
,
or inadvertence , the crown has been induced to invade the
private rights of any of its subjects , though no action will
lie against the sovereign (c) , yet the law has furnished
the

subject with a decent and respectful
mode of removing
that invasion , by informing him of the true state of the
matter in dispute ; which will then be put in a regular
train for adjudication
and adjustment .
The distance between the crown and the subject is such ,
that a personal injury can seldom proceed immediately and
directly from the sovereign to any private
man ;
and , as
it can so seldom happen , the law in decency supposes
that
it never will or can happen at all ;
because
it feels itself
incapable
of furnishing any
adequate
remedy for such
wrong , without infringing the dignity and destroying the
sovereignty of the royal person , by setting up some supe-
rior power with authority
to call him to account .
The
inconvenience
therefore of a mischief
that is barely pos-
sible , is (as Mr. Locke has observed
(d ) ) well recompensed
by the peace of the public and security of the government ,
in the person of the chief magistrate
being set out of the
reach of coercion .
And upon this principle, the sovereign cannot be made
answerable for the misconduct
or negligence
of his ser-
vants (e).
Injuries to the rights of property can scarcely
be committed
by the crown without
the intervention
of
its
officers ;
and for them the law in matters
of right
entertains
no respect or
delicacy , but furnishes
various
methods of detecting
the
errors or misconduct
of those
agents by whom
the sovereign
has
been deceived, and
induced to do a temporary injustice (ƒ) .
The
common law methods of obtaining
possession or
restitution
from the crown , of either real or personal pro-
perty , are ,
1. By petition
de droit , or petition
of right :
which is said to owe its origin to king Edward I. (g) .
2. By monstrans de droit , manifestation
or plea of right .
The former is of use where the sovereign is in full pos-

session of any hereditaments or chattels , and the petitioner
suggests such a right as controverts the title of the crown ,
grounded on facts disclosed in the petition itself ; in which
case he must be careful
to state truly the whole title of
the
crown , otherwise
the
petition
shall
abate (h) :
and
then , upon this answer being indorsed or underwritten
by
the sovereign , soit droit fait al partie
(let right be done to
the party ) , a commission will issue to inquire of the truth
of this
suggestion ( ) :
after the
return
of
which , the
attorney -general may plead in bar ;
and the merits will
be determined upon issue or demurrer , as in suits between
subject and subject .
Thus , if a disseisor of lands , which
are holden
of the crown , dies
seised
without
any heir ,
whereby the crown is primâ facie entitled
to the lands ,
and gets possession of them ; now the disseisee may have
remedy by petition
of right, suggesting
the title of the
crown , and his own
superior right (k).
But where the
right of the party ,
as well
as the right of the crown ,
appears
upon record , there the party shall have monstrans
de droit , which is putting in a claim of right grounded on
facts already acknowledged
and established , and praying
the judgment
of the court , whether
upon those facts the
crown
or the subject has the right.
As if, in the case
before supposed
, the whole
special matter is found by an
inquest of office (as well the disseisin , as the dying with-
out any heir) , the party grieved shall have monstrans de
droit at the common law ().
The
remedy by
monstrans
was
much
enlarged
and
rendered almost universal by several
statutes , particularly
36
Edw.
3 ,
c.
17 , and
2 & 3 Edw.
6 ,
c.
8 (m) , which
also allowed inquisitions
of office to be traversed or denied ,
wherever the right of a subject was concerned , except in
a very few cases (n).

upon it the right

be finally determined
against
the crown , the judgment is, quod

and by
such

the
crown
is
immediately

Although it is still
competent
to a
subject
seeking
redress as against the crown to proceed according
to the
course
above
indicated (q ) , he will probably
be
advised
rather to avail himself of the simpler
and more effective
process
provided by the recent statute 23 & 24 Vict . c. 34 ,
relating
to petitions of right , and re-modelling
the prac-
tice therewith
connected
.
A petition of right , addressed
to the sovereign , may now , if the suppliant
think
fit
,
be
entitled
in
any superior court
of
common law
or
equity
in
which the subject

matter
of
such petition
,
or
any material
part thereof
,
would
have been cognizable
if
the same had
been
a
matter
in
dispute between subject and subject
,
and
,
if
entitled
in
a
court
of
common law
,
the petition
must
state in the margin
a
venue
(r)
showing where the trial
thereon
is
to
be
.
The petition
must set forth with con-
venient certainty the facts entitling the suppliant
to
relief
,
and
must
be signed
by the suppliant
,
his counsel
,
or
attorney
(s).
It
is
to
be
left with the home secretary
,
order that the
same
may be submitted

or in such other court as the lord -chancellor may direct (u).
The time for answering , pleading , or demurring
to the
petition , on behalf of the crown , is the said
period
of
twenty -eight
days after
the
same has been left at the
office of the solicitor to the treasury , or such further
time
as may be allowed (x).
If the petition of right be presented for the recovery of
real or personal property , or any right in or to the same ,
which has been granted away or disposed of by the crown ,
a copy of such petition , allowance , and fiat , as aforesaid ,
must be served
upon , or left at the place of abode of, the
person in the possession , occupation , or enjoyment of such
property or right , indorsed with a notice requiring him to
appear thereto within eight
days , and to plead or answer
thereto in the court in which the
same is prosecuted
within fourteen days
after
service : and the party thus
served must , within the time
so limited , if he intend to
contest the petition , enter an appearance to the same , and

in such notice , or such further time as may be allowed (y).
The petition
may , under the provisions
of the recent

With regard to other matters , the inquests of office still

occasions
;
not only in regard to lands , but also to goods and chat-

exchequer by the attorney -general , is a method of suit for
recovering money or other chattels , or for obtaining
satis-
faction in damages for a personal wrong committed in the
lands or to other possessions of the crown (s) .
It differs
from
an information
filed in the court of queen's bench ,
of which we shall treat in the next Volume , for this is in-
stituted to redress a private wrong , by which the property
of the crown is affected
; that is calculated to punish
some
public
wrong committed
by the
defendant .
An infor-
mation in the
exchequer is grounded
on no writ under
seal , but merely on the intimation
of the attorney -general ,
who " gives the court to understand
and be informed of "
the matter in question : upon which
the party is put to
answer , and trial is had , as in a suit between subject and
subject.
The most usual
informations
are
those for in-
trusion and for debt : intrusion , for any trespass
committed
on the lands of the crown , as by entering thereon without
title, holding
over after a lease is determined , taking the
profits , cutting
down timber , or the like ; and debt , upon
any contract for money due to the crown , or for a forfeiture
so due upon the breach of a penal statute .
The procedure
by information
is used to recover a forfeiture , occasioned
by transgressing
a law enacted for the establishment
and
support of the
revenue : enactments which regard
mere
matters of police
and public convenience , being usually
left to be
inforced
by common
informers , in qui tam
actions .
There is also an information
in rem, when goods
are supposed to have become
the property of the crown ,
and no man appears to claim
them , and to dispute
its
title, as anciently in the
cases of treasure -trove , wrecks ,
waifs , and estrays , seized
by the king's officer for his use .
Upon such seizure an information
was usually filed in the

a proclamation
was made for
the owner (if any ) to come in and claim
the

; and
at the same time there issued
a commission
of appraise-

return
of which , and a second
proclamation

claimant
appeared , the goods were supposed derelict , and
condemned

And when , in
later times , forfeitures of the goods themselves , as well as
personal penalties on the parties , were inflicted
by act of
parliament
for
transgressions
against
the laws
of the
customs and excise , similar process
was adopted in order
to secure such forfeited
goods for the public use , though
the offender himself had escaped
the reach of justice .

5. The ancient writ of quo warranto was in the
nature 5. Quo
of a writ of right for the crown , against him who claimed
or usurped
any office , franchise , or
liberty , to
inquire by
what
authority
he
supported
his
claim , in
order
to
determine the right (u).
It lay also in case of non -user
or long neglect of a franchise , or mis -user or abuse of it ;
being a writ which commanded the defendant to show by
what warrant he exercised such a franchise , having
never
had any grant of it, or having
forfeited it by neglect or
abuse .
This writ was originally returnable
before
the
king's justices
at Westminster
(x) ; but afterwards
only
before the justices in eyre , by virtue of the statutes of quo
warranto , 6 Edw . 1 , c. 1 , and 18 Edw . 1, st. 2 (y) ; but when
those justices
had given
place
to
the king's temporary
commissioners
of assize ,
the judges
on the several cir-
cuits , this statutory
provision lost
its
effect

and writs
of

brought

into the king's hands , to be granted
out again to whom-
soever
he should please ; or , if it were not
such a fran-

was merely judgment of ouster , to turn out the party who
had usurped it (a).
The judgment on a writ of quo warranto (being in the
nature of a writ of right ) was final and conclusive
even
against the crown (6) .

law was in general defined
to be, " a rule of civil conduct ,

what

Hence
there-

objects of our law are
the establishment of rights , and the prohibition
of wrongs .
And this
occasioned
the distribution
of these

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS
Wrongs are
private or
public.
The redress
for a private
parties
blished , and under
the latter we are now to consider the
wrongs , including torts and breaches of contract , that are
forbidden , and redressed by the laws of England.
Wrongs are divisible
into two sorts or species
; private
wrongs , and public wrongs .
A private wrong
is an in-
fringement
or privation
of
some
private
or
civil right
belonging
to an individual
, and may be termed
a civil
injury
a public wrong
is a breach and violation of some
public right and duty , which affects
the whole community
;
and is distinguished
by the harsher appellation of a crime .
To investigate
the first of these
species
of wrongs , with
the remedies
appropriate thereto , will be our employment
in
the
present
Book ;
and the
other
species
will be
reserved till the next or concluding
Volume .
The more effectually to accomplish the redress of private
wrong is by injuries , courts of justice
are instituted
in every civilized
themselves, society, in order to protect the weak from the insults of
of law, orby the
stronger , by expounding
and enforcing
those
laws ,
tion.
by which rights
are defined, and wrongs prohibited .
This
by operation
suit or ac-
remedy is therefore
principally
to be sought by applica-
tion to these courts of justice
; that is , by civil suit
or
action .
For which
reason our chief employment in this
Volume will be to consider the redress of private wrongs ,
by suit or action
in
court .
But
as
there
are
certain.
injuries of such a nature , that some of them furnish
and
others require a more
speedy
remedy , than can
be had by
the ordinary forms of justice , there is allowed in any such
case
an extrajudicial
or
eccentrical kind of remedy ; of
which I shall
first treat , before considering
the
several
remedies by suit and action : and , to that
end, shall dis-
tribute the
redress of private wrongs
into
three several
species : first, that which is obtained by the mere act of
the parties
themselves ; secondly , that which
is effected
by the mere act and operation of law ; and, thirdly , that
which
arises from
suit , action , or
other
proceeding in
court , and consists in a conjunction of the other two , the
act of the parties
co-operating with the act of law.

For
if
the party him-
self
,
or
any one thus
related
to
him
,
be
forcibly
attacked
in
person
or
property
,
it
is
lawful for him
to
repel force
by force
;
and the breach
of
the peace
,
which happens
,
is
chargeable upon him only who began the affray
(e).
The law
,
in
this case
,
respects
the passions
of
the human
mind
;
and
(
when external
violence
is
offered
to
a
man
himself
,
or
one
to
whom
he bears
so
near
a
connexion
)
makes
it
lawful in him to
do himself
that
immediate
justice
,
to
which
he
is
prompted
by nature
,
and which
no
prudential
motives
are
strong
enough
to
restrain
.
The
future process
of
law may be by no means an
adequate
remedy for
an
injury accompanied with force
;
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
,
to
what
wanton
lengths
of
rapine
or
cruelty an outrage
of
this sort might
be
carried

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE WRONGS
2. Recap-
tion.
ceed the bounds of mere defence and prevention ; for then
the defender would himself become
an aggressor .
2.
Recaption or reprisal
is another species of remedy by
the mere act of the party
injured .
This happens , when
any one has deprived another
of his property in goods
or
chattels
personal , or wrongfully detains
one's wife , child ,
or servant : in which
case the owner of the goods , the
husband , parent , or master , may lawfully claim and retake
such property
or person , wherever
found ;
so it be not
in
a riotous
manner , or attended with a breach of the
peace ( ).
The
reason for which is obvious ;
since the
owner may have this
only
opportunity
of doing himself
justice
his goods might be afterwards
conveyed
away or
destroyed ; and his wife , child , or servant ,
concealed
or
carried out of his
reach ; if he had no
speedier remedy
than the ordinary
process of law.
If therefore
where
personal
property
has
been
forcibly taken
its
rightful
owner can so contrive as to regain
possession of it , with-
out violence or terror , the law favours and will justify his
proceeding ( ).
But as the
public
peace
must
be con-
sidered rather than any one man's right of property
; and
as , if individuals
were
once allowed to use private force as
a remedy for private injuries , all social justice must cease ,
the strong
would
give law to the weak , and every man
would revert to a state of nature ; for these reasons
it is
provided , that this
natural
right of recaption shall never
be exerted , where such exertion
must
occasion
strife and
bodily contention , or endanger the
peace of society .
If,
for instance , my horse is taken away, and I find him on a
common , at a fair, or at a public inn, I may lawfully seize

3. As recaption is a remedy given
to the party himself, 3. Re-entry
for an injury to his personal property , so , a remedy of the
same
kind for an injury to real
property is sometimes
permitted by entry on lands and tenements , when another
person without
any right has taken
or retains possession
thereof .
This
depends in some measure on like reasons
with the former
; and like that too must be peaceable and
without force or violence which might endanger the public
peace .
There
is
some nicety
required
in
defining
and
distinguishing
circumstances
in which
such entry might
be lawful or otherwise ;
and
especially in determining
whether notice should
be given
before re-entry and evic-
tion to the person who is wrongfully in possession (k).

species
of remedy by the mere act of the 4. Abate-
party injured , is the abatement , or removal of a nuisance . nuisance.
What
a nuisance
is , we shall find a more proper
place
hereafter to inquire .
At present we may
observe
gene-
rally , that whatsoever unlawfully annoys or does damage
to another , is a nuisance
; and such nuisance
may some-
times be abated, that
is , taken
away or removed , by the
party aggrieved thereby , so
as he commits
no riot in the
doing of it ( ).
If a wall is erected
so near to my house
that it stops my ancient lights, which is a private nuisance ,
I may enter my neighbour's
land , and peaceably pull it
down .
Likewise if a bar
or gate be wrongfully
erected
across
the public
highway , which
is a common nuisance ,
any of the queen's subjects passing that way may , if neces-
sary for the exercise of that right , cut it down and destroy

it (m) .
And the reason why the law allows this private
and summary method of doing one's self justice , is because
injuries of this kind , which obstruct
or annoy such things
as are of daily convenience and use , require an immediate
remedy ; and
cannot wait for the slow progress
of the
ordinary forms of justice .
Before proceeding to abate
a nuisance , a notice
to
re-
move it is sometimes requisite (n) .
5. A fifth case , in which the law allows a man to be his
own avenger, or to minister
redress
to himself , is that of
distress , whether
for
rent in arrear or damage feasant ,
which has been noticed in our preceding volume .
6. The seizing of a heriot when
due on the death of a
tenant is another species
of self-remedy , likewise already
noticed (0).
II.
Such being the several remedies which
may be had
by the mere act of the party injured , those will next
be
mentioned which arise from the joint act of all the parties .
1.
Accord and satisfaction
as between the party injuring
and the party injured , will bar an action for such injury .
If a man contract to build a house or deliver a horse , and
fail in it; for this breach of contract the sufferer may have
his remedy by action ; but if he accept a sum of money ,
or other thing ,
as a satisfaction , this
may operate
as
a
redress of his grievance , and entirely take away his right

serves
that
such "occasions
are
very few," and "' might
constantly
lead to breaches of the peace ; for if
a man has a right to remove a gate
placed
across the land

he would
have a right to do it even
though

owner

there

him.

to
add , that another person be

The

is
called an award.
And , if the award stands, the question
is thereby as fully determined , and the right, which was in
contest, transferred or settled , as it could have been by the
agreement of the parties
or the judgment
of a court of
justice .
The right to real property , however , could not for-
merly have thus passed by a mere award (t) : which subtilty
had its rise from
feudal
principles
; for if this had
been
permitted , the land might have
been
aliened
collusively
without
the
consent of the superior .
But an arbitrator
may now award a conveyance or a release
of land ; and it
will be a breach of the arbitration -bond to refuse compli-
ance (u).
For though originally the submission
to arbi-
tration used to be by word or in writing , yet both of these
being revocable in their nature , it became
a common prac-
tice for the parties to enter into mutual
bonds , with
con-
ditions to stand to the
award of the arbitrators

lature has by several
statutes sanctioned the use of arbitra-
tions as well in controversies depending in court , as in those
where no action has been brought .
By 9 & 10 Will . 3 , c.
15 , it was enacted , that all merchants and others , desirous
of ending any controversy , suit , or quarrel (for which there
is no
other
remedy but by personal
action
or
suit
in
equity ), may agree , that their
submission
of the suit to
arbitration
or
umpirage
shall be made a rule of court ,
and may insert such agreement in their submission , or in
the condition of the arbitration -bond (a) : which agreement
being proved upon oath by one of the witnesses
thereto ,
the court
shall make
a rule
that such
submission
and
award shall be conclusive ; and , after such rule made, the
parties disobeying the award shall be liable to be punished ,
as for a contempt of the court ; unless
such award be set
aside for corruption
or other misbehaviour
in the arbitra-
tors or umpire (y) , proved on oath to the court , within one
term
after the
award is made.
Under this statute , the
superior courts interfered
to set aside awards when par-
tially or illegally
made ;
or to
enforce
their
execution ,
when legal , by process
of contempt .
By the
above
statute , however , of 9
& 10 Will.
3 , a
parol submission could not be made a rule of court , and the
remedy by arbitration
still remained defective ; for a party
might at any time before the award was made, or after it
was made, but before the
agreement was made
a rule of
court , revoke his submission , a power which was frequently
exercised where
one of the parties
had by some means
ascertained that
the arbitrator was unfavourably
disposed
towards him.
Besides this , an arbitrator
had no power to
compel the
attendance of a witness , or to administer
an
oath to him ; and therefore if a witness on either side was

unwilling to give evidence, it was not
safe to consent to
an arbitration , and the evidence being given without
the
sanction of an oath , the proceeding by arbitration
was less
satisfactory than that
before
a jury .
It was accordingly
deemed expedient
yet further
to extend and improve
the
remedy by arbitration , and several provisions contained in
the statute 3 & 4 Will . 4 , c. 42 , were directed to this ob-
ject.
By sect. 39 , it was provided that if the submission
contained an agreement that it should
be made a rule of
court , it should
not be revocable without
leave of the
court or a judge .
By sect . 40 , the court or a judge was
empowered to command the attendance
and examination
of any person, or the production
of any document ; and
sect . 41 enabled the arbitrators
or
umpire
to administer
an oath, and has subjected a witness wilfully giving false
evidence
, in the matter of an arbitration , to the penalties
of perjury .
Other
material
improvements
have been made in the
law of arbitrations , by the statute 17 & 18 Vict . c. 125 , as
well by amending the
pre -existing
law upon
this
sub-
ject (≈) , as by enabling the court or a judge to compel a
reference to arbitration
either before or at the time of trial ,
where the matter in dispute consists , wholly or in part , of
items
of mere
account ,
which
cannot
conveniently
be
tried (a) .
Under the provisions first alluded to , an action
commenced by one of the parties to the reference
after all
have agreed
thereto may be stayed (b) , where the parties
cannot concur in the appointment of an arbitrator , he may
be appointed upon summons by a judge (c) ; where the re-
ference is to two arbitrators , and one party fails
to appoint ,
the other party may appoint an arbitrator
to act alone (d) ,

CHAPTER XIV.
THE
COURT
FOR
DIVORCE
AND
MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES .
THIS Court , which was constituted
by the stat . 20 & 21
Vict . c. 85 , was by that act made a court of record , and
given
exclusive jurisdiction in all causes , suits , and mat-
ters matrimonial
in England , except in respect of mar-
riage licences .
It holds
its
sittings
at Westminster
, and
numbers amongst
its
judges
,
in
addition
to
the judge
of
the court of probate
(a)
sitting
as
judge ordinary
,
the lord
chancellor
and all the judges
of
the
courts of queen's
bench
,
common pleas
,
and exchequer
.
As the court now under our notice
is
of
recent origin
,
and
as
the relief granted by
it
was never previously granted
by any tribunal
in
the kingdom
,
it
may not
be
improper
to
recur shortly
to
the state of the law
as
it
here existed
before its constitution
.
In the very early ages
of
this country
,
a
polygamy
of
a
very
curious
description
appears
to
have
existed
.
A
colony of some ten
or
twelve
men took
each
of
them
a
woman
,
and
these
men
and women
lived
together
in
common
.
The
children
born
of
this
promiscuous
con-
nection were common
to
the whole
company
,
and were
supported
by the
common lot
.
On the introduction
of
Christianity
,
the
fathers
of
the
church
naturally
turned
their attention
to
this promiscuous
state
of
life
,
and
pro-
mulgated certain rules setting forth the degrees
of
affinity
within
which
it
was
forbidden
for
persons
to
marry
.
These rules
,
in
themselves
salutary and just
,

wards extended to an exaggerated degree in a manner
to
which I shall shortly advert .
And so much so , that
as
early as the reign
of Edward the Confessor , considerable
complaints
appear to have been made of the clergy , who
introduced certain restrictions of marriage which for social
causes it was found necessary to discourage (b) .
Thus matters continued , the clergy , and then the eccle-
siastical
courts ,
arrogating
to
themselves
the decision
of all matters
relating
to marriage ,
and proceeding , on
the ground
that marriage was a sacrament
ordained by
the Saviour , to argue that being a sacrament it must be
held to be indissoluble .
And , indeed , the indissolubility
of the marriage contract was upheld by the law of England
from the earliest time of which we have record .
But, in-
asmuch as it could not be contended that the commission
of adultery , in itself the most flagrant and incontestable
breach of the marriage
vow ,
was
compatible
with the
cohabitation of man and wife , it was found
necessary to
adopt some means to punish the offender, and to relieve
the innocent party from the ties and obligations
of a con-
tract , already rendered unilateral
by the transgression
of
the other.
And the courts accordingly were in the habit
of decreeing a separation on the ground of adultery , such
separation giving to each party the rights of celibacy , ex-
cepting that of contracting
a new marriage .
But adultery
was found to be not the only cause which rendered cohabi-
tation impracticable -cruelty , and some other causes
soon
appeared to the courts to be just
and proper
reasons for
allowing
the
separation of man
and wife .
And such
relief was accordingly
granted , upon the principle
that it
would be alike
cruel and unjust
to compel by force the
maintenance
of a
contract ,
entered
into
perhaps with
mutual
affection
and desire , but
now virtually rescinded
by mutual
hatred and disgust .
But men
having
gained this right of separation , and

FOR
DIVORCE
partial rescission of their marriage contract , began to look
forward to these separations with a view to effecting other
and more cherished ties .
And to meet this
growing
de-
sire on the part of the
population , the
ecclesiastical law
extended to an extreme limit those
degrees
of consan-
guinity and affinity within which it was declared unlawful
that matrimony
should be contracted .
And not only was
it held that relations
of the blood to the sixth or the
seventh
degree
were
incapable
of
contracting
matri-
mony , but
that if
either party to the
marriage had
been pre-contracted
to
another , the marriage
was void-
able ; and eventually it was declared that if it happened
to any man to have carnal
connection with a woman , the
same
relations
in regard to affinity were thereby created
between them as if an actual marriage had taken place .
Upon these grounds
of pre -contract , affinity
and
carnal
knowledge , the ecclesiastical law , still upholding
the doc-
trine of the sacramental indissolubility of marriage , ex-
tended matrimonial
disability
far beyond the law of God ,
and declaring
such marriages
to have been null and void
ab initio , separated the parties "pro salute animarum ,”
lest they should
endanger their
souls by living in a state
of known
sin .
A state of things which rendered the
position of society most insecure , few men being able clearly
to know whether
a marriage which
had brought wealth ,
happiness , and
children
might not in a moment
be set
aside for a cause unknown to either party at the time of
the contract .
Thus matters continued till the time of the Reformation
,
when the view of the reformers , including Cranmer , was,
that a more extended system of divorce should be allowed ;
and that
a second marriage
should
be permitted
after a
divorce for adultery .
Proceeding
upon this view , an act
was passed
3 & 4 Edward 6, c.
11
(A.D. 1549) , enabling
the king
to
appoint
sixteen ecclesiastics , and the same
number of laymen , to order and to compile such laws eccle-
siastical , as should be thought
convenient .
Such commis-

AND
MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES .
395
sion was accordingly appointed to consider and report upon
the subject ; and
a report was drawn
up and published
under the title Reformatio
Legum
Ecclesiasticarum .
But
the king dying
before it could
be
submitted
to his
ap-
proval , this digest , though in itself
a most
authoritative
and valuable work , never received the sanction and impri-
matur of the law.
It was, however , one of the doctrines
of the Reformation , that marriage , though in itself a holy
and desirable
state , was not to be considered
as
a sacra-
ment ; and it was then for a short time held by the eccle-
siastical tribunals , that inasmuch
as marriage
had
ceased
to be regarded
as a sacrament , and as the indissolubility
of marriage was
a character that it received as a sacra-
ment , marriage being now simply
a civil contract , entered
into with the incident of a religious
ceremony, it no longer
retained the element of indissolubility
.
And accordingly
one or two persons , as we
read, were
divorced
à vinculo
matrimonii , by sentence
of an
ecclesiastical
court .
The
question , however , of the power of such courts to dissolve
marriage
was
soon settled by the
case
of Sir J. Fol-
jambe (c), which
came before the star chamber , in the 44th
year of queen
Elizabeth , A.D.
1601 , and decided that the
marriage contract retained all the incidents
of the sacra-
ment , though it no longer existed as a sacrament itself.
But inasmuch
as it is a fundamental doctrine of our law
that no wrong exists without
a remedy , and as the greatest
wrong which can be inflicted upon a man by the profligacy
or seduction of his wife was, in fact , unredressed by sen-
tence of an ecclesiastical tribunal , which , though it released
him from cohabitation with , and from support of his guilty
wife , entailed upon him an involuntary
celibacy during her
natural life, it was not long
before means
were devised to
remedy this evil .
And
as it was clear that
no judicial
authority
in the realm
had jurisdiction to make such a
decree
as would enable a man or a woman to marry again ,
recourse was had to the supreme power of the state—the

THE COURT
FOR

Lord Lough-
borough's
orders.
king , lords , and commons in Parliament assembled-to
legislate
upon the particular
circumstances
of the
case ,
and for an exceptional
injury, to supply
an exceptional
remedy .
The earliest applications
made to Parliament for such
relief as the ordinary
Courts
of the realm
were unable
to
grant ,
were
founded
on very
special
circumstances .
Thus in the
case of Mr. Lewknor (St. Tr . vol . xiii . p.
1308) , a bill was obtained , not dissolving
the marriage
so
as to enable the parties
to marry again , but
simply
bas-
tardizing
such children
as were born of the wife while she
lived in open adultery
; such adultery having been proved
before
the
Ecclesiastical
Court .
In
lord
Roos's
case
(Macqueen's
Practice
of the
House
of Lords , p . 551 ) , a
bill was passed
" to enable lord
Roos to marry again ,”
he having
been separated from his wife by reason of her
adultery , and it being politically desirable to continue the
succession from him.
In the countess of Macclesfield's
case (id. p. 574 ) , the aid of the legislature
was invoked in
consequence
of the scandalous and flagrant
circumstances
of the case . And in the duke of Norfolk's case , A.D. 1694 ,
the question of indissolubility
was raised again .
The cases cited and some others became
precedents , and
in 1701
a bill having been obtained to dissolve a marriage
and enable the petitioner
to marry again , applications for
special legislation
became
more numerous . Still , however ,
no steps were taken to reduce the practice of Parliament
to any consistency , or to regulate its procedure , and give
it somewhat more the
character of a judicial than
of a
legislative
tribunal, until
the year
1798 , when
certain
resolutions
were
passed ,
known
as lord
Loughborough's
Orders .
By these orders , no petition could be presented to the
House , unless an official
copy of the proceedings , and of
a definitive
sentence
of divorce , a mensâ
et thoro , in the
ecclesiastical
courts , was delivered on oath at the bar of
the house at the
same
time .
On the second reading of

the bill, the
petitioner
was
required
to
attend for the
purpose of being examined , if the house should think
fit
,
as
to
any collusion
touching the adultery
,
or
the bill for
divorce
,
or
touching
the proceedings
in
the ecclesiastical
court
,
or
in
any action
at
law
;
and also
as
to whether the
wife
at
the time
of
the adultery was living with
or
under
the protection and authority
of
the husband
.
In 1809
a
further
order was made
,
that no divorce bill
should
be received without
a
clause prohibiting
the offend-
ing
parties
from intermarrying
.
This
clause
,
however
,
though thus
insisted
on by the lords
,
was always thrown
out by the commons
;
and no instance
exists of
a
bill
containing
such
a
provision
becoming law
,
except
in
one
or
two
cases
where the marriage
,
if
it
had taken
place
,
would
have been
void
,
by reason
of
the consanguinity
of
the parties
.
And
in
1831
,
it
was ordered by the house
,
that when
a
trial had been had
at
Nisi Prius
,
to
which the
petitioner had been
a
party
,
no bill for divorce should
be
read
a
second
time till the judge before whom the trial
or
inquiry had taken place
,
had transmitted
a
report
of
such
proceeding
to
be laid on the table
of
the house
.
in the eccle-
court
.
The proceedings
in
the ecclesiastical
court were com- Proceedings
menced by
a
citation
,
and both parties
being
before the siastical
court
,
a
statement
of
the
petitioner's
case
,
termed
an
allegation
,
was
prepared
and
filed
in
the
cause
.
This
allegation
,
in
several
paragraphs
or
articles
,
set out
at
length
all the facts upon which
the petitioner
relied for
his decree
,
and which
he was
in
a
position
to
support by
the testimony
of
witnesses
.
A
copy of this
allegation
was delivered
to
the respondent
,
together with the names
of the witnesses
to
be
produced
,
and
a
note
of
the articles
on which each was
to
be examined
.
A
day was then fixed
for the examination
of witnesses
,
and an examiner
was
appointed for the purpose
.
The
examiner
,
who was for
this purpose an officer
of
the court
,
having
made himself
acquainted with the circumstances
of
the case from perusal
of
the facts stated
in
the allegation
,
proceeded
to
examine


398
THE
COURT
FOR

the witnesses brought before him.
Such examination being
concluded on behalf of the petitioner , and the deposition
of each witness having been taken in the form of a narra-
tive , the examiner
proceeded
to
cross-examine
him on
behalf of the respondent upon interrogatories
supplied to
him for that purpose .
The
evidence for the respondent
was then
given in the same way , upon a responsive alle-
gation ; and being taken down by the examiner , was sealed
up and retained by him till an order for publication
was
made, when the court
appointed
a day for the trial , and
counsel were heard , and judgment
was given , subject to
an ultimate
appeal to the Privy Council .
A definitive
sentence
of divorce , a mensâ
et thoro , being
thus
obtained , the petitioner
proceeded
to lay his
case
before the house of lords , in accordance with the standing
orders before adverted to , and subject to his
proving the
case , he obtained
a bill divorcing
him from the bonds of
matrimony , and allowing
him to marry again .
The pro
visions
of the bill , which was very short , were generally
these :
1.
The
marriage was dissolved .
2.
The husband
was empowered to
marry
again .
3. He was given
the
rights of a husband
as to any property of an after - taken
wife .
4. The divorced wife was deprived of any right she
might have as his widow .
5. Her after-acquired property
was secured
to her as against the husband from whom she
was divorced .
In the case of the wife obtaining
the bill ,
similar provisions were made in her favour .
In the place of this cumbrous and protracted machinery ,
there is now provided in the Court for Divorce and Matri-
monial Causes a short and casy remedy , and one open to
all classes , from its simplicity
of character and moderation.
of expense.
But though the court has been thus instituted
to hear
and decide
on such cases , nothing
can deprive the legisla-
ture of its inherent power of passing bills of divorce ; and

The relief granted by the Court for Divorce

The Court

a restitution
of conjugal
rights
in cases of desertion ; it
grants
a judicial separation in cases of adultery , cruelty , or
desertion for two years and upwards
;
a dissolution
of the
marriage in cases of adultery at the prayer of the husband ,
and in cases of adultery aggravated with certain other of-
fences at the suit of the wife ; and it declares a nullity of
the marriage in cases where the marriage appears
to be in-
valid , either by reason of some informality
in the celebra-
tion , or of some incapacity , either legal or physical , in one or
other of the contracting
parties ; it also has a power which
seems , however , to have fallen into disuse , of pronouncing
a decree in a suit of jactitation
of marriage , declaring there
to be no marriage ,
and
admonishing
the
defendant
to
cease from boasting of the alleged marriage ; and it has a
power , shared by certain inferior
tribunals , of granting
an
order protecting
a wife's earnings from her husband
and
his creditors
in
cases
where the wife has been

By the 16th section of the above-mentioned act (20 & 21
Vict. c. 85 ) , the court has power to grant a judicial sepa-
ration , which is substituted for the divorce a mensa
et thoro,
on the ground
of adultery , cruelty , or desertion for two
years and upwards ; the latter
being a ground
of separa-
tion not previously
recognised by the ecclesiastical courts .
A separation on the ground of cruelty may be granted
at the petition of either husband
or wife ; but in order to
justify such
decree , there must
be , in the language of an
eminent judge (ƒ) , " either
actual
violence
committed ,
attended with damage to life , limb , or health , or a reason-
able apprehension of such violence ."
Desertion , to be
a ground
of separation , must
be a
desertion without
cause for two years and upwards , and be
contrary to the will and without
the consent of the party
deserted .
And it has been held , upon the construction of
this
section , that the right accrues to the offended party
on the expiration
of the two
years ,
so that a bona fide
offer of a return
to cohabitation
made after that period
does not determine the desertion so
as to disentitle
the
aggrieved party to the relief prayed (g) .

Effect of the
The
effect of a decree of judicial separation , when ob-
decree.
tained , is set out in the 25th and 26th sections of the 20
& 21 Vict . c. 85, and sects . 7 and 8 of the
21
& 22 Vict .
c. 108 , from which it appears that from the date of the
sentence
and whilst the separation
continues , the wife
is
to be considered as a feme sole with respect to property of
every description
which
she may acquire
or which may
come to or devolve upon her , or to which
she has or shall
become
entitled
as executrix , administratrix
, or trustee ,
since
the sentence
of separation , or to which she is pos-
sessed
or entitled for an estate in remainder or reversion
at the date of the decree ; and such property may be dis-
posed of by her in all
respects
as a feme sole , and on her
decease the same will , in
case
she dies intestate , go
as
the
same would
have
gone if her
husband
had
been
then dead ; provided , that if she again
cohabits with her
husband , all
such
property
as
she may be
entitled
to
when
such cohabitation
takes place will be held to her
separate
use , subject , however , to any agreement in writ-
ing made between herself and her
husband whilst sepa-
rate .
She is also , whilst so separated , considered
as
a
feme sole for the purposes of contract , and wrongs
and
injuries , and suing and being sued in any civil proceeding ;
and
her
husband
is
not
liable
in
respect of any en-
gagement
or contract
she may have entered into , or for
any wrongful
act or omission by her , or for any costs she
may
incur
as plaintiff
or
defendant ;
but where upon
any such judicial
separation
alimony
has been
decreed
or ordered to be paid
to the wife , and the same has not
been duly paid by the husband , he will be liable for neces-
saries supplied for her use.
The only purpose
for which apparently
she retains her
status
as wife is in the exercise of any joint power given
to herself and her husband , which
she is not prevented , by
the operation of the decree , from joining with him in giving
effect to (h).

Mainte-

Such
decree
of separation may , however , at any time
be reversed upon the ground
that it was obtained in the
absence
of the
party
affected by it, and upon its being
further shown , where desertion was the ground of the decree ,
that there was reasonable ground for the desertion alleged .
Until such reversal however , the decree
is valid and effec-
tual for the protection
of any person or corporation who
shall
deal with the wife ; and no discharge , variation , or
reversal of the decree will prejudice or affect any rights or
remedies which
any person would
have had in case the
same had not been
so
reversed
, varied , or discharged in
respect of any debts , contracts , or acts of the wife incur-
red , entered into , or done between the times of the making
such decree
and
its discharge , variation , or
reversal (¿) .
And all persons and corporations
who , relying
on such de-
cree, make
payments to, or deal with, the wife , are pro-
tected by such order , though it be at the time actually
reversed or varied , unless at the
time
of such payment
or other dealing with the wife such persons or corporations
had notice of the reversal or variation of the decree (k),
Incident to the granting of a decree
of judicial separa-
tion is the power of the court to make orders for the future
maintenance of thewife and for the custody and maintenance
of the children .
The ecclesiastical courts acting upon the
principle
that
all
property
is
primâ facie vested
in
the
husband
,
and that the wife
is
entitled
to
be supported ac-
cording
to
the means
of
her husband during
the pendency
of the suit
,
and treating her during such suit
as
an
innocent
party
,
whether prosecuting
or
defending
,
allotted her ali-
mony pendente
lite
,
varying
very considerably
in
amount
according
to
the position
of
the parties
and the circum-
stances of the case
.
This
equitable
principle
has been
adopted by the court for divorce
,
and with
a
view
to
the
convenience
of
having the practice
in
these cases
as
far
as
possible

allow the wife , by way of alimony pendente
lite, one -fifth
of the joint incomes of the husband
and wife .
On the
termination of the suit , if in favour of the wife , the prac-
tice usually is to allot her from a quarter to one-third of
the joint incomes by way of permanent alimony , the hus-
band being at liberty , in the event of his income diminish-
ing , to move for a decrease of the allotment , and the wife ,
on the other hand , being at liberty, if necessary , to move
for a proportionate
increase .
In every case , also, in which the court makes any decree
or order for alimony , it may direct
the same to be paid
either to the wife herself
or to any trustee on her behalf ,
to be approved by the court , and may impose
any terms
or restrictions which it may deem expedient , and may from
time to time
appoint
a new trustee , if for any reason it
appears
to the court expedient so to do ( 1) .
mainte-
children.
In regard to the children of the marriage the court has Custodyand
vested in it by the 35th section of the 20 & 21 Vict. c. 85 , nance of the
a power exceeding that exercised
by the courts of law or
equity , for by it the
court is empowered to make
such
interim
and
final
orders with
respect
to the
custody ,
maintenance , and
education of the children of the mar-
riage
as it
may deem just and proper ,
and may , if it
thinks
fit
,
direct proceedings
to
be taken
for placing the
children
under
the protection
of
the
court of chancery
.
In
carrying
out the provisions
of
this
section the court
recognises the common law right
of
the
father
to
the
custody of his children
,
and
,
unless for very good reasons
,
does not interfere with such custody
.
During the pen-
dency
of
the suit
,
both parties are usually allowed reason-
able access
to
the children
,
in
whose custody soever
they
may be
;
and
in
the result their
custody
,
if

not prejudicial
to the interests of the children themselves .
In the case of a mother who is proved guilty of adultery ,
she is usually debarred from
such
access , though
it has
not been the practice to treat
the
offending
father with
the
same rigour.
And where it has appeared that the
party succeeding in the suit is not the person to whom it
would be for the interests of the children themselves that
their
custody
should
be
entrusted ,
some third
persons
willing to undertake
their
care
and approved of by the
court have been
appointed
their guardians , and an allow-
ance made to them for their support (m).
The most important function of the court is, however , in
the granting
of decrees
of dissolution of marriage .
And
for this purpose
any husband
may present
a petition
to
the court , praying
that his marriage may be dissolved , on
the ground
that his wife has since the celebration thereof
been
guilty of adultery
;
and
any
wife
may present
a
petition
praying
that her marriage
may be dissolved , on
the ground that since the celebration thereof her husband
has been guilty of incestuous adultery , or of bigamy with
adultery , or of rape ,
or of sodomy
or bestiality , or
of
adultery
coupled with
such
cruelty
as without
adultery
would
have entitled
her to a divorce à mensâ
et thoro , or
of adultery
coupled
with
desertion
without reasonable
excuse ,
for
two years or upwards ;
incestuous
adultery
being
taken
to mean adultery
committed
by a husband
with a woman with whom if his wife were dead he could
not lawfully
contract
marriage
by reason of her being
within the prohibited
degrees
of consanguinity
or affinity ,
including, therefore , adultery with the wife's
sister ; and
bigamy
being
taken to mean
marriage

any
person ,

Upon any such petition it becomes
the duty of the court ,
following in this respect the practice of the houses of parlia-
ment , to satisfy itself, so far as it reasonably can , not only
as to the facts alleged , but also whether
or no the peti-
tioner has been in any manner
accessory
to or conniving
at the adultery , or has condoned the same , and also to in-
quire into any counter -charge which may be made against
the petitioner (o).
In
case the court , on the
evidence
in relation
to any
such petition , is not
satisfied
that
the alleged
adultery
has been committed ,
or
finds
that
the
petitioner
has
during the marriage been accessory
to or conniving
at the
adultery of the other party to the
marriage , or
has
con-
doned the adultery complained
of, or that the petition
is
presented or prosecuted in collusion
with either of the
respondents , then and in any of the said cases the court
is bound to dismiss the petition (p).
If, however , it is satisfied on the evidence that the case
of the petitioner has been
proved , and does not find that
the
petitioner
has
been in any manner
accessory
to or
conniving
at the
adultery
of
the
other
party
to
the
marriage , or has condoned the adultery complained
of, or
that the petition
is presented or prosecuted in collusion
with either of the respondents , then the
court is bound
to
pronounce
a
decree
declaring
such
marriage
to be
dissolved .
It
is ,
however,
expressly
provided
that
the
court shall
not be bound to pronounce
such
decree
if it
shall
find
that
the
petitioner
has during
the
marriage
been
guilty
of
adultery ,
or if
the
petitioner
shall ,
in the opinion of the court , have been guilty of unrea-
sonable delay in presenting
or prosecuting
such petition ,
or of cruelty
towards
the
other party to the
marriage ,

deserted
or wilfully

herself from the other

plained

wilful
neglect
or
misconduct
as
has
conduced
to
the
adultery (q).
With regard , therefore , to the position
of a husband ,
he is entitled
to have his marriage dissolved on account
of the adultery of his wife , provided
his own conduct has
not been such
as
to bring him within the
prohibitory
clauses of the Act .
With regard to the wife's
position , it is
only necessary
to remark that the bigamy with adultery contemplated by
the
statute has
been
construed
to mean adultery
com-
mitted with the person with whom the bigamy has been
committed (r).
It will be observed
that there are two distinct
classes of
bars to the applicant's
right to have a dissolution
of mar-
riage , of which one class are peremptory bars , binding
the
court to dismiss the petition , and the other
addressed
to
the discretion
of the court , to be exercised according to
the circumstances of each particular
case .
Thus, accord-
ing to the 30th section , a failure of proof , the petitioner's
connivance
at , or
condonation
of, the
adultery ,
or
the
presenting
or prosecuting
of the suit in collusion
with
either
of the
other
parties to it ,
compel the court
to
dismiss
the suit ;
while
under
the
31st
section ,
the
adultery
of the
petitioner ,
or his
or her unreasonable
delay
in
presenting
or
prosecuting
the
petition
,
or
cruelty , desertion , or wilful
neglect and misconduct
con-
ducing to the adultery complained of, are only so far bars
to the suit that
the court
is not bound to pronounce
a
decree of dissolution if it finds any of such offences
to be
established .
The discretion , however , which is thus vested
in the court is a judicial and not an arbitrary
discretion ,
and as such , certain
rules
have been
laid
down by the
judges of the court for their
guidance in the exercise of
this discretion .
Thus , as to the adultery of the petitioner ,
some special circumstances
must
appear so as to bring it

within the discretionary
clause, either that it was com-
mitted in ignorance of the existence of the respondent , or
where the petitioner
bond fide though wrongfully believed
that his marriage
had been dissolved , or where
the adul-
tery complained of had occurred many years ago, and was
known to and condoned by the wife (s).
As to the un-
reasonable delay , it must
be of such a nature as to make
it appear that the
petitioner was insensible to the injury
of which he complains (t).
And misconduct
conducing to
the adultery must
amount to a breach of some marital
duty , and be of such a character
that it might fairly be
contemplated by the petitioner
as likely to lead

Before the passing

was no party to the suit in the eccle- party to the
siastical court , nor was he represented before the parlia-

Bill into their

Act , the petitioner
is bound to make the alleged adulterer
a

to

petition ,
unless ,
upon
special
grounds
to be allowed by the court , he is excused
from
doing so, and being thus a party to the suit , the court has
the power to make such order upon him as to payment of
the whole or any part of the costs of the proceedings as it
may think fit (x) .
The court has power also, in the case
of a wife's
petition , to make the woman with whom
the
husband is alleged to have committed
adultery

fully consent to or acquiesce
in the solemnisation
of such
marriage by any
person
not
being in holy orders ,
the
marriage of such persons shall be null
and void
to all
intents and purposes whatsoever .
The 8th section of the same act declares that when the
parents
or guardians , or one of them , of a minor openly
and publicly declare, or cause to be declared , in the church
or chapel where the banns
are published , at the time of
such publication ,
his
or
her
or their
dissent
to
such
marriage , such publication
of banns
shall
be absolutely
void .
First , then , with regard to undue publication
of banns .
In these cases both parties
must
be
aware of the undue
publication ,
or of the non-publication , of the banns
at
some time before the celebration of the marriage (x) : so
that when an undue publication
takes place , but is known
only to one of the parties until after the marriage , such
undue publication
does not work a nullity (y) .
The great object in these
cases is to obtain
publicity ,
and to give to those persons interested an opportunity
, if
they think
fit
,
of
objecting
to
the
marriage
.
And for
this reason
,
a
publication
of
banns
in
a
man's
name of
reputation
,
though
not
of
birth
,
may
,
under
some cir-
cumstances
,
be valid

So ,
also ,
in the
case of
an illegitimate
person , the
use of the
name
of the

in
addition
to that of the puta-
tive
father
by which
the party was generally

In a marriage by licence the identity of the parties using
Marriage by
the licence is the important
point to establish , in contra-
distinction
to a marriage by banns , where the due publi-
cation is the material consideration (d) .
And so much so ,
that
when
the
name of one of the parties
is wrongly
inserted in the licence , though
for the express
purpose of
concealment , the marriage had by virtue of such licence is
not invalidated (e) .
Neither
will
the fact of the licence
being granted
by a person not duly authorised
to
do so
invalidate
a marriage
had by virtue
of it, unless
both
parties at the time of the marriage
know of the incom-
petency of the party so granting
it (ƒ) .
When both parties consent to or acquiesce in the solem-
nization of matrimony
by a person not in holy orders , or
where a minor is married
contrary to the express dissent
of parent
or guardian ,
openly
and publicly declared
at
the time of the publication
of banns in the place where
such banns are published , a marriage
celebrated by such
person, or after
such declaration
of dissent , is null
and
void .
Save
as above, the want of consent , in the
case of a
minor , does not affect the validity of the marriage (g) .

THE
COURT
FOR
DIVORCE
Physical in-
capacity.
Protecting
order.
The
court can also, subject to an appeal to the house
of lords (h) ,
decree
a nullity of marriage , by reason of
the physical
incapacity
of either of the parties .
When
such incapacity is in the nature of congenital malformation ,
proof of such fact is sufficient without any specified period
ofcohabitation to found the decree . When there is no such
impediment , the court requires evidence
of a sufficiently
long cohabitation without
consummation of the marriage ,
to satisfy it that such non-consummation arises from some
defect of a permanent
and incurable
nature .
The eccle-
siastical courts formerly required
a triennial
cohabitation
in such cases ; latterly, however , the rule
has been
much
relaxed , the admissibility
of the parties
themselves
as
witnesses in these suits rendering
such strict
precaution
no longer
necessary
.
A wife deserted by her husband
may at any time after
such desertion , if resident within the metropolitan
district ,
apply to a police magistrate , or if resident in the country
to justices in petty sessions , or in either case to the divorce
court , for an order to protect any money or property she
may acquire by her
own lawful
industry ,
and property
which she may become possessed
of, after such desertion ,
against her husband or his creditors , or any person claim-
ing under him ; and such magistrate
or justices
or court ,
if satisfied of the fact of such desertion , and that the same
was without
reasonable cause , and that the wife is main-
taining herself by her own industry or property , may make
and give to the wife an order protecting
her earnings and
property acquired since the commencement of such deser-
tion ,
from
her
husband
and
all creditors
and
persons
claiming
under him.
Such
earnings
and property then
belong to the wife as if she were a feme
sole , and if the
husband or any creditor of or person claiming
under the
husband
seizes
or continues to hold any property of the
wife
after notice of any such order , he is liable , at the

suit of the wife
(which she is empowered by the statute to
bring) , to restore the specific property , and also for a sum
equal to double the value of the property so seized or held
after such notice .
During the continuance of such order
the wife
is, and is deemed
to have been,
during
such
desertion of her , in the like position
in all respects, with
regard to property
and contracts , and suing
and being
sued, as she would be if she obtained a decree of judicial
separation (i).
And the order , in addition
to protecting
property acquired by her own lawful industry , or of which
she may
become possessed
after the desertion , protects
such also as she may become entitled to as executrix , ad-
ministratrix,
or trustee , after the commencement of the
desertion (k) ;
and
also
any
property
to
which
she
is
entitled
in
remainder
or
reversion
at
the
date of the
desertion (1) .
Every order must state the time at which the desertion ,
in consequence
of which the order is made, commenced ;
and such statement is conclusive as regards third persons
dealing with the wife (m).
All persons and corporations
who , in
reliance
on such
order , make
payments
to,
or
permit
transfers
or acts to be done by the wife , being
protected by the order , though
such
order be actually
discharged
or
reversed
at
the time
of the
payment ,
transfer , &c.
provided that at the time of their dealing
with the
wife
such persons
acted without
notice of the
reversal or discharge (n) .
The order , if made by a police magistrate
or by justices
at petty sessions
, must , within ten days of the making,
be entered with the registrar
of the
county
court within
whose jurisdiction
the wife is living (o) .
This
proviso ,
however , is
directory , and
not
imperative
;

is valid , though the order may not have
been
registered
within the time specified (p).
Having thus treated of the relief which
the court has
the power
to grant , it
becomes
necessary
to
inquire
shortly
into its ordinary
course of procedure.
With re-
gard to all suits and proceedings , other than
proceedings
for dissolving
a marriage , the court is bound
to
act
and
to give relief upon the principles
and rules which
in
its
opinion are
as
nearly
as
possible conformable
to
the prin-
ciples and rules on which the ecclesiastical courts formerly
acted
,
and gave relief
in
such suits
,
subject
,
however
,
to
certain
alterations
in
the procedure
directed
by the act
constituting
the court
,
and controlled
by the rules
and
orders
made by virtue
of
the
powers
conferred
on
the
judge ordinary
.
The procedure
of
the court
is
by petition
and
answer
,
the petition
setting out shortly
in
paragraphs
the peti-
tioner's
case
,
and concluding with
a
prayer for such relief
as
is
sought
;
and the
answer setting
out
in
paragraphs
the answer
to
the charges
made by the
petitioner
,
and
any
counter
charges
which
may be
necessary for the
respondent
to
make
,
either for the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
dismissal
of
the
petition
,
or
for
obtaining
relief
for
injuries
under which
he
or
she
is
supposed
to
suffer
.
The
petitioner
has then the
same
right
of
pleading
in
reply
,
and the respondent
of
re
-
joining
as
now exists
in
common law pleadings
.
And the same right of pleading
applies
to
a
co
-
respondent
or
other person made
a
party
to
the suit
.
The petition and the answer
,
where the latter
contains
anything
more than
a
traverse
of
the
matter
alleged
in
the petition
,
are
supported
by an affidavit
of
the party
verifying
the contents
.
The
pleadings
being
concluded
,
the
judge
directs
the
mode
in
which the
case
is
to
be tried
.
In
cases
of

,

of
the
parties
may claim

questions of fact tried by a jury ; and for this purpose the
court has a similar
power of summoning juries to that
possessed
by the common law courts .
Subject
to
any
order
which
the
judge
may
make ,
the
witnesses ,
in
all proceedings
before the
court where their attendance
can be had , must be sworn and examined
orally in open
court . The court may , however , give liberty
to the parties
to verify
their
cases in whole
or in part
by affidavit ,
subject
to the liability of the
deponent in
every such
affidavit
to be
cross -examined
by or
on behalf
of the
opposite party orally in open court .
Trials upon affidavit ,
however , are very rarely
permitted
except in case of a
petition
for a dissolution
of marriage
on the ground
of
bigamy , where the respondent has been already tried and
convicted of the bigamy
which
is the foundation
of the
suit.
And in cases where the marriage
has taken place
abroad , and the validity
of the marriage is not one of the
questions in the suit , the court usually permits such mar-
riage , and the identity
of the parties
to it, to be proved
by affidavit .
In proceedings
other
than
those for a dissolution
of
marriage , it is lawful for
the
court , but not obligatory
upon it , to direct the truth of any question of fact arising
in the suit
to be tried before itself, or before any of the
judges ofthe court , by the verdict of a special or a common
jury (q).
The court may also direct
an issue to be tried
in any court of law, either before a judge of assize , or at
the sittings in London
or Middlesex , as is now done by
the court of chancery ; and the rules of evidence observed
in the superior courts of common law at Westminster
are
applicable to and observed
on the trial of all questions of
fact in the court .

THE
COURT
FOR
DIVORCE
the
husband
or
wife
of
such
party ,
is
a
competent
witness
in the
suit ;
thus
excluding
the evidence of all
parties to a suit for
a dissolution
of marriage , or for
a
judicial separation where adultery
is charged in the pe-
tition.
But when a wife became entitled
to
a dissolu-
tion of her marriage
on proving
her husband's
adultery ,
coupled with either his desertion
or his cruelty towards
her ; and it was clear that the
only person
who
could
give
satisfactory
evidence of such
cruelty
and of such
desertion would in most instances be the wife herself , the
22
& 23 Vict . c . 61 , s .
6 , made
the
husband
and wife
respectively competent
and compellable
to give evidence
of or relating
strictly
to such cruelty or desertion , on
any
petition
presented
by a wife
for
a
dissolution
of her
marriage by reason of her husband's
adultery , coupled
with
cruelty
or
desertion .
A
previous
modification
of
the
above-mentioned
acts was also
effected
by the 43rd
sect. of the 20 & 21 Vict . c. 85, by which the court may ,
if it think
fit
,
order the attendance
of
the petitioner
,
and
may examine him
or
her
,
or
permit
him
or
her
to
be
examined
or

examined
on
oath upon the hearing
of
the petition
.
No such petitioner
is,
however
,
bound
to
answer any questions tending

By the 20
&
21
Vict .
c.
77 ,
called " The Court of Jurisdic-
Probate Act , 1857 ," all the jurisdiction and authority of
the
ecclesiastical
courts , in respect of the
granting
and
revocation of probates of wills and letters of administra-
tion in England , was taken from such courts and granted
to a court holding
its
sittings
in London , and called the
court of probate .
This court
is
presided over by a judge
who
ranks
with
the judges
of the
superior
courts of
common law , and as Judge Ordinary of the Divorce Court
has precedence in his Court next after
the
Lord
Chief
Baron , and who . is assisted in his duties
by four regis-
trars and a secretary, in addition to the other usual officers
of
a
court .
The
court
exercises jurisdiction
over the
granting
of probates and letters of administration
, and
determines
all
questions
relating
to
matters
in testa-
mentary
cases ,
and
its
business
usually
consists in
pronouncing
upon
the
validity of wills
and
codicils ,
and deciding , in cases of intestacy , upon the person to
whom the administration
of the deceased's
estate is to be
committed .
Formerly this
function
was
exercised by
different
courts
throughout
the
country , those
of the
several
dioceses
having
power
to
grant
probate
and
administration
when a person died having
goods within
their jurisdiction .
But questions of difficulty
and expense
frequently
arose as to which of the courts had the right
of making
such
grant
and
receiving
the
fees
payable
thereon , the right depending
mainly
upon the question
of whether
the
deceased
person
had
personal
estate , or


424
THE
COURT
OF

Proof of
wills .
what was then called bona notabilia within the jurisdiction
of the particular
court .
Now, however , such questions no
longer
arise , for the court at Westminster
, by means of
its
different
registries
in
London
and
throughout
the
country , has jurisdiction to grant probate
and letters of
administration
in all
cases
where
a person
has
died
leaving
personal
estate
in this country .
By the insti-
tution
of this court
a state of things , also, which
was
anomalous and discreditable
to the legal procedure of the
country
has been rectified , for the
probate of a will , as
granted by the ecclesiastical court , was only binding upon
the personal estate of the testator , and was not conclusive
in regard to his real estate
; and this , although the testator
might by such will
have
appointed
an
executor ,
and
formally have devised his lands
to the person for whose
benefit he intended them .
And , accordingly , it was not an
uncommon
occurrence for the same will disposing of the
real and the personal
estate
of the testator , to be held a
valid will when contested
in the ecclesiastical courts on the
question of the administration
of the personalty , and to
be declared an invalid will when
contested
in an action
of ejectment brought by the heir -at-law for the recovery
of the lands so devised by the testator from the
person
to whom
he
had
devised them .
Now, however ,
where
proceedings
are
taken
to dispute
the validity of
a will ,
or for the purpose of proving it in solemn form of law,
where
the will
affects
the real
estate , the
heir -at-law ,
devisees , and other persons having
or pretending
interest
in the real estate
affected
by the will , are made parties to
the suit , and are bound by the decree pronounced in it.
A will may be proved by the executor , if an executor is
appointed in the will , at his
option , either in common
form-in which
case the probate may at any time after-
wards be called in and disputed-or in solemn form , when
he is compelled to cite the next -of-kin , and other persons
adversely affected by the will , after which it cannot
at
any future
time
be disputed by the persons so cited , or


THE COURT
OF
PROBATE .
425
by persons claiming
under
or through
them .
Similarly ,
it may be proved by the
residuary
legatee , in
case
no
executor
is
appointed ,
and if no
residuary
legatee
is
named , then by the next -of-kin or by a legatee.
Where
an
executor
is
appointed
in
a will ,
and
he
declines
or takes no step towards
proving it, he may be
cited by the persons
interested
under
the will to show
cause why he should not take probate : and if, upon such
citation , he either renounces probate , or does not appear,
then
his right
in
respect
of his
executorship
entirely
ceases , and the representation of the testator , or the ad-
ministration
of his
effects , will go in such manner as if
he had not been appointed executor (a) .
In speaking of a will, the term "will " must be taken
to include one or more codicils , because
a man's will may
consist not only of that portion of his testamentary papers
which
is
commonly
called
his will , but of any number
of testamentary papers , not inconsistent with each other,
from the whole of which , taken together , his intentions
are to be drawn ;
and all that
is
necessary to
entitle
papers to probate
as
a will , apart from
the
question of
due execution , is that
they should
have been written
in
the lifetime of the deceased , and contain
his final wishes
as to the
disposition
of his
estate
after
his
death .
But in citing an executor
to
take
probate of a will ,
there being a will and one or more codicils , it is compe-
tent to a party to contest the validity of one or more of
the codicils , without
necessarily contesting the validity of
the whole of the will.
And the same rule applies
to
cases
where
no
executor
is
appointed , but
where
the
residuary
legatee, or some
other person , is applying
for
a grant of administration
with the will annexed .

In cases of intestacy , the court has the power , formerly

which , however , is
usually
exercised
in
favour
of the
widow .
In the case of the death of a married
woman ,
her husband
is
entitled
to the
administration
of her
effects , unless
she has duly made a will by virtue of a
power or otherwise
during
the coverture , which the hus-
band is not in
a position
to dispute , and provided
she
was not protected by an order under the
Divorce Act , or
by a decree
for a judicial separation , or by a divorce a
mensa
et thoro ; in either of which events her next-of-kin
would be entitled to take out administration
in preference
to the husband . If the intestate leaves
no wife , adminis-
tration
is granted
to the
next -of-kin , according to their
degree , or to the persons entitled
in
distribution
, or , in
default
of any
such persons taking out
administration
,
then to a creditor .
The business of the court is divided
into the common
form
business
and
contentious
business :
the
common
form
business , including
the granting
of probates and
administrations
, where there is no contention
as to the
right thereto
or when the right having
been contested
has been determined , and the contentious
business re-
lating to such
matters
as
come
into
litigation .
The
common form
business , which
is usually brought
before
the
court
by motion
and
affidavit , in
relation
to the
granting
of probates , disposes of such questions
as how
much
of
a
man's
testamentary
papers
are
entitled
to
probate ,
as to whether , upon an admitted state of facts ,
the execution is of such a nature as to be in conformity
with the requirements
of the Wills
Act ,-as to whether
obliterations , alterations , interlineations
, or erasures
ap-
pearing upon the
face
of a will are entitled
to probate
-in reference to contingent
or
conditional
wills ,
as to
whether
or not the contingency or the condition
referred
to in the will has happened,-with
a view
to the proof
of the contents of a lost will ,
whether
the will
was
lost
under
such
circumstances
as

that it was revoked ,-as to whether or not

to

questions
of law
or
practice

also ,
to the testamentary

tion of documents , and this happens in cases where a man
in making
his will refers to some
other document then in
existence ,
and
directs
his
property
to
be
distributed ,
either wholly or partially , according to the terms of that
document .
This mostly happens in cases where a testator
refers to his
marriage
settlements , or to former wills , or
lists of plate or valuables
which
he wishes to be distri-
buted in a particular
way when the instrument
or docu-
ment
so
referred
to
becomes
part
of the will ;
but
the reference
in the will to incorporate
such paper with
it must be clear and distinct , so
as to preclude the possi-
bility of any mistake in the identity of the paper ; and the
paper itself must
be one already in existence , though it
need not be in the possession or even under the control of
the deceased .
With regard to obliterations , alterations , interlineations
, oblitera
and
erasures , a will may be entitled
to probate with or
without them , according to whether
or not they existed
on the will
at the time of the
execution ; and the pre-
sumption of law, in the event of there being no evidence
one way or the other , will be that the will at the time of
its execution
by the
testator did not contain

assent, or it may be made by her
to carry her

and the court , in
determining
whether
or
not
such will is
entitled
to
probate , will
not
go minutely
into the question , but will
only
require to be satisfied
that the testatrix
had a power
reserved

entitled to separate
estate , and will , if so satisfied , grant
probate to her executor , leaving it to the court of chan-
cery, as the court of construction , to say what portion of
her
estate , if any , will pass under
such will .
In this
case the husband , though he may not be entitled
to take
probate of his wife's will, may
administer to such of her
effects
as do not pass under the will .
In cases , also , where a question
arises on the construc-
tion of
a will , and where the actual
appearance of the
paper may be supposed to be of assistance to the court of
construction ,
as , for
instance , where
a question
arises.
whether
a person has signed a paper under
such circum-
stances
as to lose his
legacy as
a legatee , the court will
sometimes grant probate infac simile.
The 24
& 25 Vict . c.
144 , contains
a very important
enactment with regard to the wills of British
subjects
made out of the United Kingdom .
It is declared by that
act, " that every will and other testamentary instrument
made out of the United Kingdom by a British
subject ,
whatever
may be the domicile of such person at the time
of making the
same , or at the time of his or her
death ,
shall , as regards personal estate , be held to be well executed
for the purpose of being admitted in England to probate ,
and in Scotland to confirmation , ifthe same be made ac-
cording to the form required either by the law of the place
where the same was made, or by the law of the place where
such person was domiciled when the same was made, or by
the law then in force in that part of her Majesty's dominions
where he had his domicile of origin " (b) ; and no will , or
other testamentary instrument , will be held to be revoked ,
or to have become invalid , nor will the construction thereof
be altered by reason of any subsequent change of domicile
of the person making
the same (c).

the widow or next of kin of the deceased , on their giving
the usual
administration
bond , and of granting certain
special administrations
to meet the requirements
of dif-
ferent
cases .
As , for instance , administration
ad colli-
genda bona is granted in cases where there is some pressing
urgency for getting in the estate of the testator , and where
damage to the
estate would
accrue
by waiting
the
usual
time
for obtaining
a grant of administration
; but this
is
a grant which is only made under very special circum-
stances , and without
any peculiar regard to the interest of
the party who applies
for it .
Also grants
de bonis
non
administratis , where
an
executor
or administrator
dies
leaving
part
of the
deceased's
goods
unadministered ,
and
this
is
usually
made
to those
persons who
would
have
been
entitled
to the
administration
in the
first
instance .
Also

when

the appointment
fails ;
also administration

lite,
and other limited
and special administrations

to
meet the requirements
of particular
cases .
The
court
has
also very full
powers under
the
73rd
section of The Court of Probate Act , 1857 , where a person
has died intestate , or leaving
a will , but no executor will-
ing to take probate , or where the executor is out of the
United Kingdom , and it appears to the court to be neces-
sary
or convenient
by reason of the
insolvency of the
estate of the deceased , or other special circumstances , to
appoint
some person to be administrator
other than the
person who would
otherwise
have been
entitled
to the
grant to appoint
any person it shall think
fit
,
upon his
giving such security
as
the
court
shall direct

This
is
a

provision which was introduced
for the first time by the
legislature
in the Court of Probate
Act ,
1857 , and has
been found
to be
attended with the
greatest
possible
convenience in
the
administration
of the
property
of
deceased
persons.
The
court also makes grants of probate or of adminis-
tration
in cases where there is no direct
evidence
of the
death of the party whose estate it is sought to administer .
As , for instance , when a man has sailed on a voyage , and
nothing has since been heard of the ship or crew , or after
an unexplained
absence
for
seven years, the court acting
on the principles
of the common law will presume him to
be dead, and permit the executor or administrator
to swear
that he died on or after the day upon which
he was last
heard of.
Also , in the case of two or more persons dying
at the same
time, when it is impossible
to prove which
survived
the other , e. g. , a husband
and wife dying
in a
shipwreck
or a massacre , the
court will grant adminis-
tration
to the husband
as
a widower , allowing
the
ad-
ministrator
to swear that there was no reason to believe
that the wife survived her husband .
The business of proving
a will or codicil is commenced
business.-
by the entry of a caveat, or by the issuing
of a citation ,
and the defendant having appeared to the citation , or in
answer to the warning of the caveat, the contentious pro-
ceedings are said to have commenced .
The first
step in
these proceedings
is for each party to file his affidavit
of
scripts , and bring into court all the testamentary papers
of the
deceased
in his
custody , or
under
his control ,
and
at the
same
time to make
affidavit
that
no
other
testamentary
papers of the
deceased
have come to his
hands ,
possession ,
or
knowledge ,
before
or
since
the
death of the
testator . If there
are
any
testamentary
papers
in
the
hands
of
persons
not parties
to
the
suit , which it is necessary or
desirable to have brought
into court , the judge
has power
to issue a subpœna to
such third
persons
commanding
them to bring
such


THE
COURT
OF

431
papers into the registry , and in the event of their
non-
compliance with the terms of such
subpoena , to enforce
their
obedience
by attachment .
The scripts having
been
filed , the party propounding
the will files his declaration ,
to which the other party pleads , and issue is joined .
This
having been done, the court directs the trial either before
itself alone , or by a special or common jury , or where the
property , if real estate , is situate in the country , or where
the
expense
of bringing the witnesses up to town would
be considerable , then before a judge of assize ; and where
the personalty is under 2007. , and the realty under 3007. ,
the suit may be determined in
the
county
court .
The
court has also power to grant a discovery of documents ,
to issue orders and commissions for the examination
of
witnesses , and to make such other orders in reference
to
the trial of its suits as are made by the courts of common
law and equity .
The
questions
for
determination
in
a
probate
suit ,
independent of the question of the
right of the party
to
contest the validity of the will, resolve themselves
usually into
questions
of the
execution
of the will
according
to the
requirements
of the Wills Act , of the
testamentary capacity of the
deceased , and of his know-
ledge and approval of the contents of his will , affirmative
proof of which
issues
lies upon the party propounding
the
will.
Also whether
the will
has been wholly
or in part
obtained
by undue influence , or by fraud , or whether
the
will has been wholly or in part
revoked by the testator ,
affirmative proof of which
issues lies upon the party op-
posing
the will , and these issues are
tried by the
same
rules of evidence
as are observed
in the courts of common
law.
The heir -at-law, when the will affects the real estate ,
having been made
a party to the proceedings , is entitled , if
he thinks fit , to appear and plead , and take part in the
proceedings ; and similarly the next of kin , and persons
who have obtained
leave
to intervene in the
suit , as in-
terested
under former wills
or otherwise , may , subject to

Administra-
tion.
any order of the court
as to costs , also appear and take
part in the proceedings , their actual share in the trial of
the issues joined in the suit being regulated by the discre-
tion of the presiding judge.
The different issues in the suit having been disposed of,
the
court
pronounces
either for or against the will , and
exercises
its
discretion
as
to the condemnation
of the
several parties in the costs of the suit.
The next of kin ,
however , of a deceased , are entitled
upon giving notice
that they merely insist on the will being proved in solemn
form of law, and only intend
to cross -examine
the wit-
nesses produced in support of the will , to put the executor
upon such proof of the will , without
the liability of being
themselves condemned in costs .
The court has power to grant new trials of jury causes
and rehearing of non-jury causes , and any party dissatisfied
with the judgment
of the court may appeal to the house
of lords
as of right from
a final decree , and by leave of
the judge from interlocutory
decrees
or orders .
Where the right to administration
is contested in an in-
terest suit, the parties propound their different interests by
declaration and plea , and their right is determined by the
court as in a probate suit ; but where there is no dispute as
to the relationship
or the interest of the party , and where
the only question is to which of several applicants
the ad-
ministration
is to be granted , the practice
usually is for
one party to file what
is termed
an act
on petition , to
which
the other party files an answer , the averments of
which
are supported
by affidavit , and the matter is dis-
posed of by the judge on the consideration
of such peti-
tion and answer and affidavits .
As an incident to the trial of both probate and adminis-
tration
suits , the judge has power to appoint an adminis-
trator
pendente
lite
to deal with the personalty ,
and
a
receiver to deal with the real
estate , and has the
same
power to enforce its various
decrees
and orders as is now
possessed
by the court of chancery .


THE
COURT

433
Where, however , a question of legitimacy
or of pedigree
is to be determined , then
the process usually
is for
the
party to declare as next -of-kin , and set out his pedigree ,
and the case is tried in a somewhat similar
manner to an
action of ejectment , where the heir-at-law has to make
out his title to the
estate .
Questions of interest
also
frequently
arise
as incidents
to
a suit for the obtaining
or revoking of probate , because
every person appearing to
oppose
the
executor ,
or
other
person
who
is
seeking
probate of a will or administration
with a will
annexed
,
has to set out in his appearance the character in which he
appears, and the interest which
he affects to take in the
estate of the testator ; and it is competent
to such
exe-
cutor or other person to dispute
his right to appear in
such capacity , and call upon him to state in a declaration
the actual interest which he so takes .
This declaration is
then pleaded to , and the proceedings
take the form of an
interest suit .

Jurisdic-
tion .
CHAPTER XVI .
THE
HIGH
COURT
OF ADMIRALTY .
THE
high court of admiralty
is a court of very great
antiquity , tracing
back at least as far as the time of Ed-
ward III. , and it formerly
entertained not only civil suits ,
but it also had an extensive criminal jurisdiction .
The
latter , however , so far as it relates to crimes committed at
sea , is now exercised by the commissioners of the central
criminal court , or by judges
of
assize ,
as
the
circum-
stances
may require ; and the civil jurisdiction has of late
years been greatly modified and extended so as to bring it
more into accordance with the requirements
of the times .
It exercises a jurisdiction equitable
as well as legal , and
has
a similar power of enforcing
its decrees
and
orders
to that possessed by courts of common law.
It has , also ,
power to make and issue such rules , and give such direc-
tions for the trial of suits , as may from time to time be
necessary for that purpose .
By the
24 Vict . c.
10 , the
high court of admiralty
is constituted a court of record
for all intents
and purposes , and has power to proceed
either in rem or in personam :
in personam by calling
upon the masters or owners of vessels
to show cause why
they should
not
appear and defend the
suits
instituted
against
them ;
and in rem by arrest of the ship itself,
which is only released
upon bail being
given to the full
amount of the claim and costs likely to be incurred in the
suit .
The
court
formerly ,
also ,
under
certain
circum-
stances , proceeded
by arrest of the person of the defendant .
This
process, however, seems of late years to have fallen


THE
HIGH
COURT
OF ADMIRALTY .
435
into disuse .
The Admiralty Court Act of
1861
(24 Vict .
c. 10) has considerably extended and improved the proce-
dure and practice of the court , and by virtue of that act,
and also by the original jurisdiction
possessed
by the court ,
it can now try nearly all maritime
questions which
arise
in reference to British and foreign ships .
The suits usually
entertained by the court are for the
purpose of enforcing
bottomry or respondentia bonds ; to
obtain salvage awards ; to enforce
the payment of money
due for necessaries
supplied to a ship , or for wages due to
the master or crew , or for towage or pilotage services
; to
recover damages
in cases of collision , and of damage done
by any ship ; also in cases of damage to goods , or in re-
spect of breaches of contract , where the owners of the vessel
are domiciled
abroad .
The court also entertains questions
of prize and booty of war , but it exercises
this jurisdiction
by virtue of a warrant
issued for that purpose , giving it
special jurisdiction in that behalf.
dentia and
bonds.
With regard to respondentia
and bottomry bonds , the Respon-
master of a ship has a right to give one or more bonds , in bottomry
the nature of mortgages , upon his ship for such amount
as may be necessary to enable the vessel to proceed on
its journey
and
to
complete
its
voyage .
These
bonds.
constitute
a liability , which attaches to the ship , notwith-
standing it may be sold by the owner and the money re-
ceived by him without
any notice to the purchaser of such
bond .
The same rule applies to the case of a respondentia
bond ; the difference
between
that and a bottomry being ,
that whilst in bottomry the master pledges the ship and
freight
as well
as
the cargo, in respondentia
the cargo
alone
is
pledged .
In
enforcing
these
bonds
the last
is given precedence
over those previously
executed ;
and
the
court
takes
into
consideration
the
circumstances
under
which the
loan
was
effected ,
and, provided
the
bond itself is of such a nature
as to lead it to believe
that
there has been
no fraud
in its inception ,
and that
it represents
a
bona fide transaction , enforces
the bond ,

notwithstanding
the usual formalities
of a bond of that
nature have not been complied with .
The 3 & 4 Vict. c. 65 , s . 6 , gives the court jurisdiction
to decide all claims and demands whatsoever in the nature
of salvage for services rendered to or damage received by
any ship or sea -going vessel, or in the nature of towage ,
Salvage
claims
are usually enforced in the first instance
by an arrest of the
vessel , if the vessel can be arrested
by the salvors who
make the claim ;
and the court , in
making its award , considers whether the salvage has had
reference to the preservation of life , or of the ship , or of
the cargo , and makes such award as it thinks proper , acting
upon the principle , that the preservation of life is entitled
to a higher reward than the salvage of ship or cargo.
The same section gives the court power to decide and
enforce claims in the nature of towage , or for necessaries
supplied to any foreign
ship
or
sea -going vessel.
This
provision is extended by the 5th section of the Admiralty
Court Act , 1861 , by which
it is declared , that the Court
of Admiralty shall
have jurisdiction
over
any claims for
necessaries
supplied to any ship elsewhere
than in the port
to which the ship belongs , unless it is shown to the satis-
faction of the court that at the time of the institution of
the cause any owner or part owner of the ship is domiciled
in England or Wales , provided , however , that
unless the
plaintiff recover

It has , also, Questions

The powers
exercised by the high court
of admiralty
have recently , by the 31 & 32 Vict . c.
71 , been
conferred
on
certain
county
courts , by virtue
of which
they are
entitled
to try claims for salvage where the property saved
does not exceed 1000l. , or where the amount claimed does
not exceed
300 %. ; claims for towage, necessaries
, or wages
where the amount claimed does not
exceed
1507.; claims
for damage to cargo , or for damage by collision
where
the amount
claimed
does
not
exceed
3007.
They
have
also jurisdiction
(by the
32
&
33
Vict .
c.
51 ) to try
and determine
any claim
arising
out of any agreement
made in relation to the hire of any ship or in relation
to
the
carriage
of goods in any ship , and
also
as to any
claim in tort in respect of goods carried in any ship , pro-
vided the amount
claimed
does
not
exceed
3007.
This
proviso , however , does not prevent the parties from trying
all
such suits
in the
county
court , although
the
claim
exceeds
the
amount
above
limited , if they agree
in
writing that such
county
court (being
a
county
court
having
admiralty
jurisdiction
) shall
have jurisdiction to
try the case .
The judge of the county court may also (by section 5 of
the last -mentioned
act ), at the request of either party , be
assisted by two mercantile
assessors .
An appeal from any final decree , or order of the county
court , in an admiralty
case , or by permission of the judge
of the county court , from any interlocutory
decree or order
therein , lies
to
the high court of admiralty , subject
to
security for costs being given .
No appeal , however , lies
from any decree
or order of the high court of admiralty
made on appeal from the county court , except by the express
permission
of the judge of the high court of admiralty ,
and no appeal lies unless the amount decreed
or ordered
to be due exceeds the sum of 501.
The practice of the Court of Admiralty is regulated by

which
parties
are entitled
to prove their case , subject to
their complying
with the necessary formalities , either by
affidavit , by written
depositions , or by the oral examina-
tion of witnesses in open
court , or partly by one mode and
partly by another .
In all cases , however , where the oral
examination
of witnesses can be had , it is the practice of
the
court to incline

Masters.
The court , at the hearing of the
cause , has power to Trinity
summon
to its
assistance
Trinity
Masters
to
sit
as
assessors , and it usually does
so in
cases
requiring
for
their determination
any peculiar
knowledge
of nautical
science .
Thus in cases of collision it is almost a matter of
course for the court to require the presence of the Trinity
Masters upon application from either party for that purpose ;
and there is power under the Admiralty Court Act , 1861
(section 8), for the court to make an order for the Trinity
Masters
to inspect any ship , or other
property , the in-
spection of which may be material
to the
issue in the
cause .
The appeal from the high court of admiralty
is to the Appeal.

Council.
It lies , as of

but from

Jurisdic-
tion.
CHAPTER XVII .
ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS ,
ETC.
THESE courts formerly
exercised
a very extended juris-
diction , comprising within their scope
the determination
of all testamentary
causes
and suits , and the granting of
probates and letters of administration
.
They also enter-
tained
matrimonial
suits ,
and
had
power
to
decree
a
divorce
a
menså
et
thoro , and
to give
the relief, now
granted by the court of divorce , except, as has been before
stated , the dissolution of the marriage tie.
Their powers ,
however , of late years
have been
very considerably
re-
stricted .
Thus , their jurisdiction
over all
matters
and
causes
testamentary , including suits
for legacies ,
or for
the distribution
of residues , was taken from them by the
20 & 21 Vict.
c.
77 , and
conferred
upon
the
court of
probate.
Their jurisdiction in matrimonial matters and
suits was taken
from them by the 20
& 21
Vict . c. 85 ,
and conferred upon the court for divorce and matrimonial
causes .
Their jurisdiction in the matter of church rates ,
which
was formerly
a most fruitful
source of litigation ,
has been abolished
by the
31
&
32 Vict . c. 109 , which
declares that , after the passing of that act, " no suit shall
be instituted , or proceeding
taken , in any ecclesiastical
or other court , to compel the payment of any church rate
made in
any
parish
or
place in England
or
Wales . "
Their jurisdiction, also , in
cases of brawling, except
as
between persons in holy orders , has been taken
away by
the 23 & 24 Vict . c. 32 , which has given power to justices
of the peace to fine or imprison
persons found
guilty of


ECCLESIASTICAL
COURTS .
441
unlawfully interfering
with any clergyman
in holy orders
during the service , or of making
disturbances in churches
or chapels , churchyards
or burial grounds .
And the juris-
diction
to entertain suits for defamation was abolished by
the 18 & 19 Vict .
c . 41.
During the last session
of par-
liament , also , a bill was introduced
for the purpose of
further altering their jurisdiction , and re-moulding
their
procedure ; and although
such bill failed
to become law,
it is extremely probable that some considerable alterations
will shortly be made both in their jurisdiction and in their
procedure .
In the
view of such
probable
legislation
,
therefore , it is hardly necessary to do more than allude
cursorily to the powers and the ordinary process of these
courts .
against
The business of the ecclesiastical
courts , of which the suits
principal
are the consistory courts of the bishop of each
clergymen ;
diocese , and the
court
of
arches , which
sits
at West-
minster , is now mainly confined to inquiring
into charges
of heresy, of improperly
conducting
the
service of the
church , and of immoral
or scandalous conduct on the part
of clergymen .
These suits , which are of a criminal
nature ,
are preceded by an inquiry
under
a commission
issued by
the bishop of the diocese
in which
the offence is
alleged
to have been committed , and
a consequent report
of the
commissioners to the effect that there are sufficient primâ
facie grounds
for instituting further proceedings .
The
charges are usually for neglect of duty as a clergyman , or
violation of the duties of the sacred
office , for scandalous or
immoral
conduct , for brawling in a church or churchyard ,
for simony , or for maintaining
doctrines , or performing
divine
service
in a manner contrary to the articles of re-
ligion as by law established .

These courts have also jurisdiction to entertain suits of Against

against
laymen , for gross immo-
rality, for damaging the church or the churchyard , or not
repairing
the chancel or
aisle when it is incumbent
on
them to do so

any
person
for
defacing
or removing
the
monuments
or the pews , or otherwise
improperly inter-
fering
with the church
or churchyard
without
a faculty
previously granted by the ordinary .
They also entertain
certain
suits of a civil nature , as ,
for instance , a suit known
as
a suit for perturbation
of
seat , where a party claims to be entitled to a certain pew
or seat in a church from which he has been excluded ; and
which may be brought
either
against the churchwardens ,
to
secure
the claimant's
quiet enjoyment of his
seat , or
against the actual intruder , to compel him to prove his
title
or to cease his intrusion for the future .
In respect
of this right, however , an action for trespass will also
lie
at common law against the intruder , where the plaintiff
can show by prescription
a right to the seat or the pew
which he claims .
When, also , it is desired to make
such alterations in a

by a
faculty
(or permission ) from the ordinary , the ordinary ,
before granting
such faculty , causes all persons having an
interest in opposing the grant
to be cited to show cause
why such grant should not issue , and in the event of any
persons
appearing
to show
cause
against the
issuing of
the grant , a suit
becomes
instituted , and the parties are
heard , their various
objections
are
considered , and judg-

Formerly the evidence was
taken upon depositions

the

courts are em-
powered to take evidence viva voce, and this is the course
usually pursued .

CHAPTER
XVIII.
THE
COUNTY
COURT ,
AND
SOME
OTHER
COURTS
OF
LIMITED
JURISDICTION .
THE County court is a local tribunal , originally instituted
by the stat . 9 & 10 Vict . c . 95 , held at prescribed periods
in the district
assigned to it , and presided over by a single
judge
or his duly appointed
deputy .
So much of the
business
of this
tribunal
as is
routine ,
or
other than
judicial , being principally performed by the registrar .
The county court has had
conferred upon it by many
statutes separate
branches of jurisdiction
, so that it ad-
ministers
not
merely
the
common
law ,
but likewise
equity (a) and
bankruptcy (b) , and discharges
duties in
regard to probate
and
administration
(c) , as a court
of
admiralty (d) , and
otherwise .
We shall here, however ,
treat only of the two most important
branches of county
court jurisdiction , viz . , that which it originally possessed
under the 9 & 10 Vict . c. 95 , as extended by subsequent
statutes (e), and that which was given to it by the 28 & 29
Vict. c. 99 , amended by the 30 & 31 Vict. c. 142 .
As introductory
to our remarks
upon the actual juris-
diction of the county court , we may observe that no action

which can be brought
therein , is now maintainable in an
inferior court
not of record (f) ;
and if an
action
be
brought in any other than
a superior
court of law which
could have been brought in a county court , and the verdict
recovered be for less
than
107. , the plaintiff will not be
entitled to recover from the defendant
a greater amount
of costs than he would have been allowed if the action had
been brought in the county court , unless the judge certify
that it was
fit
to
be
brought elsewhere
(g).
With respect
also
to
any action which may be brought
in
a
superior
court
of
common
law
,
both
parties
may
agree
,
by
a
memorandum
duly signed
,
that
a
county
court
named
therein shall have power
to
try such action
,
and thus give
it
jurisdiction
so
to
do
(h).
But where an action
is
com-
menced
in
a
superior which
might have been brought
in
the county court
,
the
consequence
will either
be
its com-
pulsory removal into such latter
court
,
or
loss
of
costs by
the plaintiff
().
And further
,
if
an
action
be
brought
in
a
county court which that court has
no
jurisdiction
to
try
,
the judge will order the cause
to
be
struck out
,
unless the
parties consent
to
the court having jurisdiction
to
try the
same
(
).
By the provisions here referred
to

has the legis-
lature especially endeavoured
to
induce litigants
to
resort
to
local courts
,
recently established
for the adjustment
of
limited
demands

This court may accordingly take cognizance
of an action upon
a bill of exchange , or for the recovery
of
goods

the
value

50 %.;

court (n) ; nor where the
claim

A plaintiff cannot , however , divide
any cause of action ,
for the purpose of bringing two or more suits in a county
court (p) ;
but , though
claiming " a debt ,
damage,
or
demand " for more
than
50 %. ,
he
may , if so
minded ,
" abandon the
excess ," and recover there to an amount
not exceeding the 50 %. (9).
The consequence
, as regards costs , of suing for breach of
contract in a superior court , where the claim might have
been heard in the county court , will be presently noticed ;
we may , however , here observe , that where in an action of
contract brought in a superior
court , " the claim indorsed
on the writ
does
not
exceed
50l . , or where
such
claim ,
though it originally exceeded
507. , is reduced
by payment ,
an admitted set-off, or otherwise to a sum not
exceeding
50%.," it is competent to the
defendant , if he contest the
whole or part of the plaintiff's demand , to call upon him
by summons to show cause
before
a judge at chambers
why such action should not be tried in the county court ,
or one of the county courts in which it might have been
commenced ,
and the judge will,
unless
there
be good
cause to the contrary , order that the action be there tried
accordingly ( ).

We may add, that by stat . 19 & 20 Vict . c. 108 , s . 25 ,
where in any action in the county court " the title to any
corporeal or incorporeal hereditament , or to any toll , fair ,
market , or franchise , shall incidentally
come in question ,'
the judge will have jurisdiction to decide the claim which
it is the immediate object of the action to enforce , if both
parties
at the
hearing
consent , in writing , to the judge
having such power ; but the judgment of the
court will
not be evidence of title between the parties or their privies
in any other action in that court , or in any proceeding in
any
other court ;
and such
consent will

under the county court statute

are
restricted
to
tenancies " where
neither the value of the premises , nor the rent payable in

the term of tenancy of such premises has expired or been
duly determined
by notice , but
the
tenant
persists in

necessary proofs
being ad-

possession to be

To the sum-

There
are no written
pleadings in a suit in the county
court ; but if any one or more of certain defences
are in-
tended to be set up , notice thereof , unless the plaintiff
consent to waive it , must
be given
to him.
These de-
fences are set-off, infancy , coverture , the statute of limi-
tations , and discharge under any statute relating
to bank-
rupts (a).
Any other defence is available to the defendant
at the trial, whether by traverse or confession and avoid-
ance , without any formal joinder
of issue .
Interrogatories
may now by leave be delivered by either party to the suit
to his adversary (b) , and an inspection
and discovery
of
documents may be obtained (c).

matters
as well of fact as of law ; but a jury
may be summoned
on the requisition
of either party
to
the suit , as matter of right , should
the amount
claimed

it is worthy
of remark , that in any action brought
in a
county
court for the price or value of goods or chattels
which
or some part of which were sold and delivered
to
the defendant to be dealt with in the way of his trade ,
profession , or calling (f) , the plaintiff may , at his option ,
cause
to be issued a summons in the ordinary
form , or
(upon filing an affidavit ) in the
form
provided
by sta-
tute (g), and if such last -mentioned summons be issued ,
it must
be personally
served on the
defendant
twelve
clear days at least before the return day thereof , and then
if the defendant do not , at least six clear days before such
return
day , give notice in writing , signed by himself, his
attorney or agent, to the registrar of the court from which
the summons issued , of his intention
to defend , the plain-
tiff may , within two months after such return day, without
giving any proof of his claim , have, upon proof by affidavit
of the service of the summons , judgment
entered up against
the defendant for the amount of his claim and costs .
The
order upon such judgment will
be for payment forthwith,
or at such times , and by such instalments
as the plaintiff
has in writing consented to take at the time of entering
the plaint.
If, however , the defendant give such notice
as above specified , the action will be heard in the ordinary
course ; and in any event the registrar will , immediately
after the
last
day for giving
such
notice , inform
the
plaintiff by letter whether
the defendant has or has not
given notice of his intention to defend.
If the action brought in the county court be founded on
contract , and the defendant does not appear at the hear-
ing, either in person or by some one duly authorised
on
his behalf , and no sufficient
excuse for the defendant's
absence
be shown , the
registrar

with the
order of the judge for payment of the money recovered

It is competent
to either
party , dissatisfied with the
verdict or decision of the
case , to apply for a new trial ,
which the judge may in his discretion order
to take place
before a jury , although
the action was not originally
so
tried (0).
The mode of removing a cause from the jurisdiction of Certiorari.
the county court to that of a superior court , is by writ of
certiorari .
The
right of so removing
a cause exists
at
common law, but conditions have been annexed by statute
to the
exercise of the
right in
regard to
cases
in the
county court .
By the 9 & 10 Vict. c. 95 , a cause may be
thus removed when the debt or damage claimed
exceeds
5l., by leave of a judge
of one of the superior
courts , if
the cause
shall
appear to him proper to be so removed ,
and on such terms as he shall deem
fit
to
impose
(p
).

in

it
may

under the

party applying for the writ

conditions
imposed by
such judge
in
the exercise

point of law, or upon the
admission
or rejection
of evi-
dence , such party may appeal from the same to any of the
superior courts of common law at Westminster
(s).
Before ,
however, the appeal is allowed to be prosecuted , sufficient
security must be given by the appellant (†) .
An appeal may be brought from the decision of a county
court judge , on the same grounds and subject to the same
conditions
as specified in the 13 & 14 Vict . c. 61 , s. 14, in
any action of ejectment , or in which the title to a corpo-
real
or incorporeal
hereditament
comes
in question , and
with the leave of such judge in any action in which
an
appeal had not previously
been allowed (u).
And here may conveniently be mentioned two species of
injuries , which may be done to suitors and others by courts
of limited jurisdiction : they are- 1 , when justice
is de-
layed by an inferior court having proper cognizance of the
cause ; and , 2 , when such inferior
court takes upon itself
to examine and decide
a cause without
legal authority .
1. The first of these injuries , refusal or neglect of jus-
tice , is remediable at common law by writ of procedendo ,
inert
Writ or of mandamus.
A writ of procedendo
issues where the
judge of a subordinate
court delays the litigating parties ,
and will not give judgment , either on the one side or on the
other , when he ought to do so . In this case a writ of pro-
cedendo will be awarded , commanding
him in the queen's
name to proceed to judgment
; but without
specifying any
particular judgment , for the judgment , if erroneous, may
be set aside or rectified :
and
upon
further
neglect
or
refusal , the judge of the
inferior
court may be punished
for his contempt , by attachment (x) .
Mandamus.
The writ of mandamus, so far as it falls under our pre-
sent consideration , is a command
issuing in the queen's
name from the court of queen's bench , and directed to an

THE COUNTY

inferior
court of judicature
within the queen's dominions ,
requiring it to do some particular
thing therein
specified ,
which the court
of queen's bench has previously deter-
mined , or at least supposes
to be consonant to right and
justice .
It is a high prerogative writ, of an extensively
remedial nature (y), and issues where the party has a right
to have something
done , and has no other specific means
of compelling
its
performance
.
A
mandamus may
,
accord-
ingly
,
issue
to
the judge
of
an
inferior
court
,
commanding
him
to
do
justice
according
to
the powers
of
his
office
,
whenever the same
is
delayed
,
or
where
he
refuses
to
act
(
≈).
For
it
is
the
peculiar
business
of
the court
of
queen's
bench
to
superintend
inferior
tribunals
,
and therein
to
enforce the due exercise
of
those judicial
or
ministerial
powers with which the crown
or
legislature
has invested
them
and this not only by restraining
their excesses
,
but
also by quickening
their
negligence
,
and
obviating
their
denial
of
justice
.
This writ
is
grounded
on
a
suggestion
,
by the oath
of
the party injured
,
of
his own right
,
and the
denial
of
justice below
:
whereupon
,
in
order more fully
to
satisfy the court that there
is
a
probable ground for such
interposition
,
a
rule
is
made directing the party complained
of
to
show
cause why
a
writ
of
mandamus
should
not
issue
:
and
,
if
he shows no sufficient
cause
,
the writ itself
is
issued
,
at
first
in
the alternative
,
either
to
do
thus
,
or
signify some reason
to
the contrary
;
to
which
a
return
,
or
answer
,
must be made
at
a
certain
day
.
And
,
if
the in-
ferior judge
,
or
other person
to
whom the writ
is
directed
,
returns
or
signifies an insufficient
reason
,
then there issues
in
the
second
place
a
peremptory
mandamus
,
to
do
the
thing absolutely
:
to
which
no other
return will
be
ad-
mitted
,
but
a
certificate
of
perfect obedience and due exe-
cution
of
the writ

ence , he is
punishable
for his contempt by attachment .
But , if he, at the first, returns a sufficient cause , although
it should be false in fact , the court of queen's bench will
not try the truth of the fact
upon
affidavits .
By virtue
of the statute
1 Will . 4 , c. 21 , the party applying
for the
writ may , however , plead to , or traverse all or any of the
material
facts
contained
in the
return ,
and
the
party
making it may reply , take
issue, or demur , and by this
mode of procedure damages and costs may be recovered ,
and a peremptory writ of mandamus may be awarded (a) .
Also , by the 6 & 7 Vict .
c.
67 , if the
party prosecuting
the writ wish to object to the validity of the return , he
may do so by way of demurrer , upon which the same pro-
ceedings will be had as in a personal action ; and the party
aggrieved by the judgment , may sue out a writ of error in
the same manner as a party to a personal
action
may do ,
and similar proceedings will be taken thereupon and costs
awarded, as in ordinary
cases of writs
of error (6) .
An
action will also
lie
at
suit
of
the party injured for
a
false
return
to
a
mandamus
,
and damages may be
recovered
therein equivalent
to
the injury sustained
,
and likewise
a
peremptory mandamus may
be
obtained
to
the defendant
to
do his duty

,
as

ordinary remedy for the

of
neglect
or
refusal
to
do
justice
by

either
the
cause
originally , or
some
collateral
matter
arising
therein ,
does
not
belong
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court which
entertains it, but to the cognisance of some
other court .
All lawful jurisdiction , it has been said (ƒ) ,
is derived from , and must be traced to the royal authority ;
and any exercise , however fitting it may appear , of juris-
diction not so authorised , is an usurpation of the preroga-
tive , and a resort
to force unwarranted
by law.
Upon
both of these grounds , therefore , viz . , the infringement of
the prerogative , and the unauthorised
proceeding against
the
individual , prohibitions
will be granted
to restrain
the
court
from
intermeddling
with
or
executing
any-
thing which by law it ought not to hold plea of ; ex. gr.,
if in the lord mayor's
court of London , which
is an in-
ferior
court , the custom of foreign
attachment
should
be
extended to a case where neither the debt sued for nor the
debt alleged to be due from the garnishee to the original
debtor arose within the city, no one of the parties being a
citizen
or a resident within the city (g).
Prohibition will
also go to the county
court , should it assume to try a
matter
not within the limits
of its
statutory
jurisdic-
tion (h).
A short summary of the regular procedure in prohibi-
tion is as
follows
:-The
party
aggrieved in the
court
below applies to the superior
court , setting forth in his
affidavits the nature and cause of his complaint , in being
drawn ad aliud examen , by a jurisdiction
or manner of
process disallowed
by the laws of the
kingdom : upon
which , if the matter
alleged
appears to the court to be
sufficient , the writ
of prohibition
immediately
issues ;
commanding
the judge not to hold , and the party not to
prosecute, the plea.
But sometimes the point may be too

nice and doubtful
to be decided merely upon motion : and
then , for the more solemn determination of the question ,
the party applying
for the prohibition
is directed by the
court to declare in prohibition
, the declaration
concisely
setting forth so much only of the proceeding in the in-
ferior
court
as is
necessary
to
show the
ground
of the
application .
To this
declaration
the defendant pleads or
demurs , and the judgment
is that
a writ of prohibition
shall or shall not issue.
The action of prohibition
is thus
in effect nothing
more than
an issue directed
in a dis-
puted
case only to
inform
the
conscience of the
court
whether
the
court
below has
power
to
proceed
;
both
parties
are
actors ,
and
no damages
can be
recovered
therein , unless the plaintiff in the inferior court proceeds
after a previous
prohibition
( ) .
The practice connected
with prohibition
to a county court has, we may add, been
modified
by statute (k) , so that the matter brought before
the superior court , or
a judge thereof , as the ground
for
granting
the writ , is finally disposed of by rule or order ,

and practice of the county court will , for the purposes
of
this volume of our Commentaries , suffice.
The powers of
this tribunal have thus far been
gradually
extended
and
amplified by piecemeal legislation ; their
actual condition
being unsatisfactory (g) , and such as cannot reasonably
be
expected to endure.
The policy of recent parliaments
has
in the main been similar to that of our ancient constitu-
tion , as regulated
and established by the Anglo - Saxons ,
whose endeavour was to bring justice home to every man's
door, by constituting
as many
courts
of judicature
as
there were manors and townships in the kingdom , wherein
injuries
might
be redressed in
an
easy and
expeditious
manner , by the suffrage of neighbours
and friends .
The
(g) The Judicature Commission-
ers, in their
first
Report ,
1869,
p. 8, observe, that the present state
of the county
courts may be appro-
priately
referred
to
as exhibiting
the strange working of a system of
separate
jurisdictions
,
even when
exercised by the
same court .
The
county
court
(they
re-
mark ) has jurisdiction in common
law cases, up to
50%. in contracts ,
and to 107. in torts . It has also
equitable
jurisdiction
in
certain
cases when the
value
of the
pro-
perty in
dispute
does not exceed
5007., and in
at least
one of such
cases,
namely ,
an
administration
suit , it is now
competent
for any
county court judge
to restrain
the
prosecution
of actions
brought
by
creditors
in
any
of the
superior
courts
of common law.
By
stat .
31 & 32 Vict . c. 71 (amended by 32
& 33 Vict . c. 51) some of the county
courts have also been invested with
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
a large
class of cases, where the amount in
dispute
does not
excced, in some
cases
150l .,
and in
others
3007.
There is an appeal in each class
of
cases, within
certain
limits ,
to a
court of common law, to the
court
of chancery , or to the court of ad-
miralty.
But these jurisdictions ,
though
conferred
on the same court
and the
same
judge , still
remain
quite
distinct and
separate .
The
judge
has no power
to administer
in one and the same suit any com-
bination
of the different
remedies
which
belong to his three jurisdic-
tions,
however
convenient
or ap-
propriate
such
redress
may
be.
That
can
only
be
accomplished
,
under the
county
court
system , by
three distinct suits
brought
in the
same
court
and
before
the
same
judge , carried
on under
three
dif-
ferent forms of procedure , and con-
trolled by three
different
courts of
appeal .
In this
case, therefore ,
although
we appear at first sight to
have obtained
that
great desidera-
tum , the consolidation
of all the ele-
ments of a complete
remedy in the
same
court , yet,
as that remedy
can only be had in three
separate
suits , the evil is equally great .

A hundred -court was only
a larger

for all the inhabitants
of a particular
hundred
instead of
a manor .
The free suitors were here also the judges ,

in

It

said
by
sir
Edward

to
have been derived out

for
the
ease

the people
,
that they might have justice done
to
them
at
their own doors
,
without
any charge
or
loss
of

its
institution
was
probably
coeval
with
that
of

in
the Anglo

Saxon
times
,

from the

of
forty
shillings
(

The county court now spoken
of
still exists
for important
practical purposes
.
The freeholders
of
the
county are the real judges
,
the sheriff
being
a
ministerial
officer
in
this court
.
The
great
conflux
of
freeholders
,
supposed always
to

at
the county
court
,
(
which
Spelman

is
the reason why
all
acts
of
parlia
ment
at
the end
of
every session
were wont
to
be
there
published
by the sheriff
;
why outlawries
are there
pro-
claimed
;
and why popular elections which the freeholders
are
to
make
,
as
formerly
of

(that
is , the sheriff ) " ad
quartam circiter

those times the county court was a court of great dignity
and splendour , the bishop
and the caldorman (or earl)
with the principal
men of the shire sitting therein
to
administer justice both in lay and ecclesiastical causes (p).
But its dignity was much impaired , when the bishop was
prohibited
and the
earl neglected to attend it (q) .
And
the county court here treated of was
at length
deprived
of its civil jurisdiction by the 9 & 10 Vict . c. 95.
court.
The forest
courts , although
still existing ,
claim
our Forest
attention
by reason of their ancient rather
than of their
actual
importance .
We shall first notice
them histori-
cally , and then briefly indicate the jurisdiction
and powers
which survive to them .
The forest courts (r ) were instituted for the government
of the king's forests in different parts of the kingdom , and
for the punishment
of injuries done to the king's deer
or
venison , to the vert or greenswerd , and to the covert in
which such deer are lodged .
They included
the courts of
attachments , of regard , of sweinmote , and of justice - seat .
The court of attachments , woodmote , or forty days ' court ,
was to be held before the verderors of the forest once in
every forty
days ( s) ; and was instituted
to inquire
con-
cerning
offenders
against vert and venison (†) ; who might
be attached by their bodies, if taken with the mainour (or
mainceuvre , a manu) , that is, in the very act of killing
venison , or stealing
wood , or preparing
so to
do , or by
fresh
and
immediate
pursuit
after
the
act
had
been
done (u) ;
else
they
were attached by their
goods.

this
forty
days ' court the
foresters
or keepers
were
to
bring in their attachments , or presentments
de viridi e
venatione ; and the verderors were to receive the same , to
enrol them , and to certify them under
their seals to the
court ofjustice - seat , or sweinmote (e) : for this court could
only inquire
of, but not convict , offenders.
2.
The court
of regard , or survey of dogs , was held every third year
for
the lawing
or
expeditation
of
mastiffs
,
which was done
by
cutting off the claws and ball
(
or
pelote
)
of
the fore
-
feet
,
to
prevent them from
running
after deer
(x).
No other
dogs but mastiffs were
to
be thus lawed
or
expeditated
,
for
none others were permitted
to
be kept within the precincts
of the forest
,
it
being supposed that the keeping of these
.
and these only
,
was necessary for the defence of
a
man's
house
(y
).
3.
The court
of
sweinmote was held before
the
verderors
,
as
judges
,
by the
steward
of
the
sweinmote
thrice
in
every year
(2),
the sweins
or
freeholders
within
the forest composing the jury
.
The principal
jurisdiction
of
this court was
,
first
,
to
inquire into the oppressions
and
grievances
committed
by the officers
of
the forest
;
"

and
,
secondly
,
to
receive and try presentments
certified
from the court
of

against offences
in
vert and

(a).

,

also proceed to try presentments in the inferior
courts of
the forests , and to give judgment
upon conviction of the
sweinmote.
And
the chief justice
might therefore
after
presentment made, or indictment
found , but not before (d),
issue his warrant to the officers of the forest to apprehend
the offenders .
It might be held
every third year ; and
forty days' notice was to be given
of

sitting
.

court

the chief justice

These justices
in
eyre were instituted
by king Henry
II
.,
A.D.
1184
(h);
and
their
courts were formerly
very regularly
held
;
but the
last court
of
justice

of
any note was that holden
in
the reign
of
Charles
I.
,
before the earl
of
Holland
;
the
rigorous proceedings
at
which are reported by sir William
Jones
.
After the restoration another was held
,
pro formâ
only
,
before the earl
of
Oxford
();
but since the æra
of
the Revolution
in
1688
,
the forest laws fell much into dis-
use
,
to
the great
advantage
of
the subject
.
They
are
,
however
,
administered
in
a
mitigated
form
,
and within
very restricted geographical limits
at
the present day
.
There are
,
indeed
,
now only three royal forests existing
in
England
,
viz

the New Forest
,
Dean

,

part
of

Other
courts.
of which court the verderors , elected
by the freeholders
of
the
county , are
the judges .
The
course
of
procedure
observed there is
briefly this .
The presentment
of an
offence
is made by the
keeper of the walk in which it
occurred at one court and is heard at the next ensuing
court , one verderor
being
competent to receive the pre-
sentment , though two verderors are present at the hearing
of the case (m).
The court of attachments deals with wrongful inclosures ,
purprestures , encroachments , or trespasses (n) ; breaking
down inclosures , burning
heath or
fern , destroying
the
covert, or stealing
the wood of the forest (o).
It
deals
also with
offences
in depasturing
cattle , horses , or other
beasts at improper
times by those who have common of
pasture
at certain
seasons
within the boundaries
of the
forest ; and it also has cognisance of the depasturing of
beasts at any
season by those who have not common of
pasture (p ) , and of the misconduct
of regarders
or other
officers of the forest (q) .
For
such misdoings
pecuniary
penalties may be inflicted by the court .
The verderors also fine persons having rights of turbary
for taking
turf from
pasture land instead of from the
heath ground , and for cutting
the turves in an improper
manner and contrary to the forest rule .
Persons charged
with damaging
trees
or with poaching
being
generally
sent before the magistrates (r).
Besides the
above
courts
some
others
deserve to
be
(m) One or more of the regarders
of the forest also usually
attend the
court , but do not take
any part in
the proceedings .
They ought
to
present any offence that
may come
to their knowledge .
The regarders
are elected by the freeholders of the
county .

Forest
the court of

derors , is still held every forty days ,
with
a jurisdiction in regard
to
trespassers
similar to that
above
set forth, and power to inflict
fines
not exceeding
207. in amount .
It
also has some criminal jurisdiction .
In Waltham
Forest
courts
have
not been held for some years ; they
could
however
at
any time be re-

the courts

and the
stannary

court
in
Devonshire

,
for the ad- Stannary

in
part legal
,
and not super-

they might not be drawn from their

The effect
of
these
,
so
far
as
relates
to
our
present purpose
,
was
:
that all tinners
and labourers
in
and about the stannaries should
,
during
the time
of
their
working therein
bonâ fide
,
be
privileged
from
suits
of
other courts
,
and be only impleaded
in
the stannary court
in
all matters
,
excepting pleas
of
land
,
life
,
and member
.
In
each of the stannaries of Cornwall there was for-
merly
a
court
called
the
steward's
court
,
in
which
he
exercised
a
common law jurisdiction
,
and the vice
-
warden
of the stanneries
exercised
in
his
court
an
original
equitable jurisdiction
(z).
These jurisdictions
were con-
fined to cases wherein tin
or
tinners were concerned
,
and
did not extend
to
matters
relating
to
lead
,
copper
,
or
other
metals

CERTAIN
COURTS

JURISDICTION .
Courts of
London, &c.
covered in the
county .
By various
statutes , however,
below cited (a) , the jurisdiction of the stannary court has
been amplified , and the procedure in it has been
revised .
The
stannaries
of Cornwall and
Devon
now form
one
entire
district .
The
vice -warden
has
jurisdiction
in
actions of contract or tort to the extent of 50 %. , and his
equitable jurisdiction extends to cases arising with respect
to the operations of any mine worked for lead , copper , or
any
metallic
mineral ,
as fully
as with
respect
to
tin
or tin-mines (6). It extends also to non-metallic minerals
found in the same mine
and worked by the same adven-
turers (c) .
From the decisions of the vice-warden , both
in equity and at common law, an appeal lies to the lord
warden , assisted by two or more members of the judicial
committee of the privy council , or judges
of equity ,
or
courts of law at Westminster
; and every judgment of the
lord warden is subject to an appeal to the house of lords.
The
courts within the city of London
(d) , and
other
cities
and boroughs
throughout
the
kingdom, held
by
prescription , charter , or act of parliament (e) , are to be

It would ,
indeed ,
exceed
the design
and
compass
of our present
inquiries , if we
were
to
enter
into
a particular
detail
of
these
local
tribunals-to
examine
the
nature
and
extent
of their
several
jurisdictions
, and the mode of procedure observed
in them .
It must in general
suffice to say, that these
special jurisdictions
arose
originally from the favour
of
the crown to those
particular
districts , wherein
we find
them
erected , upon
the
same
principle that hundred-
courts,
and the like ,
were
established
;
for
the
con-
venience of the inhabitants , that
they
might prosecute
their
suits ,
and
receive
justice
at home : that, for the
most part , the
courts at Westminster
Hall have a con-
current jurisdiction with these, or else a superintendency
over them
and
that
the
proceedings in these
special
courts ought to be according to the course of the common
law, unless
otherwise
ordered by parliament
; for though
the king may erect new courts , yet he cannot
alter
the
established course of the law.

that the students might

Privi-
leges of this kind are of very high
antiquity,
and were
generally
en-
joyed
by
foreign
universities
,
as
well as by our own .
(See, for in-
stance , Cod . 4, 13. )
In
England ,
the
oldest
charter
containing
this
grant to the university
of Oxford ,
was
28 Hen.
3,
A.D.
1244.
And
the same privileges
were confirmed
and
enlarged by almost
every suc
ceeding prince , down to king Henry
VIII.; in the
fourteenth
year of
whose
reign
the largest
and most
extensive charter of all was granted .
One similar to which was afterwards
granted to Cambridge
in the third
year of queen Elizabeth .
But yet ,
notwithstanding
these charters , the
privileges
granted
therein , of pro-
ceeding in a course
different
from
the law of the land, were of so high
a nature , that they were held
to be
invalid ; for though
the king might
erect new courts , yet
he could
not
alter the course of law by his letters

CERTAIN
COURTS
OF LIMITED
JURISDICTION .
Commis-

privilege
of Cambridge in this particular
has been re-
stricted by a recent
enactment ( ) , and formerly differed
from that of Oxford
: extending only to causes of action
accruing in the town and its suburbs ; whereas the juris-
diction of the chancellor's
court at Oxford
extended , and
still extends , to all personal causes
anywhere arising (1).
The respective jurisdictions
of these courts are not affected
by the county court acts (k).
The last
species
of courts to be here mentioned is that
of commissioners
of sewers .
This was formerly a tem-
porary tribunal
erected
by virtue of a commission
under
the
great seal ;
which
used to
be granted pro re natâ
at the
pleasure
of the
crown ,
but afterwards
at
the
discretion
and
nomination
of the
lord
chancellor ,
lord
treasurer , and chief justices , pursuant
to the statute 23
Hen .
8,
c.
5.
The jurisdiction of the
commissioners
being to overlook the repairs of sea banks and sea walls :
and the cleansing
of rivers , public
streams , ditches , and
other conduits , whereby any waters
are carried off : and
being confined to such county or particular
district as the
commission
expressly named .
The court of the old com-
missioners of sewers
was a court of record (1) ; and in the
patent .
Therefore , in the reign of
queen Elizabeth , an
act of parlia-
ment
was obtained
(13 Eliz . c. 29)
confirming
all the
charters
of the
two
universities ,
and
those
of 14
Hen . 8 and 3 Eliz . by name, which
" blessed act," as sir Edward
Coke
entitles it (4 Inst . 227), established
this high privilege without any doubt
or opposition
; or,
as sir Matthew
Hale
observes
(Hist .
C.
L.
33),
"Although king Henry the Eighth,
14 anno
regni sui, granted
to the
university a liberal charter , to pro-
ceed
according
to the
use of the
university , viz ., by a course
much
conformed to the civil law, yet that
charter
had not
been
sufficient
to
have
warranted
such
proceedings
without the help of an act of par-
liament .
And therefore in 13 Eliz.
an act passed, whereby that charter
was in
effect
enacted ;
and it is
thereby that at this
day they have
a kind of civil
procedure , even in
matters
that are of themselves
of
common
law
cognisance ,
where
either of the parties is privileged ."

of Oxford is fully

either
according

(

),

otherwise
at

.
They were also
to

lands within their
district
,
as
they
should judge
necessary
;
and
if
any
person
refused
to

the

empowered
to
levy the same by distress

CHAPTER II.
REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS BY THE
OPERATION
OF
LAW .
THE remedies for private wrongs , which
are effected
by
the mere operation
of law, will fall within a very narrow
compass
the principal
are these , known
as , I.
Retainer ,
(where a creditor is made executor or administrator
to his
debtor) .
II.
Set-off.
III. Remitter , to which
may be
added , IV. , the effect of the marriage of parties in certain
cases .
I. If a person indebted to another makes his creditor or I. Retainer.
debtee his executor (a) , or if such creditor
obtains letters
of administration (6) to his debtor ; in these cases the law
gives him a remedy for his debt , by allowing him to retain
so much
as will pay himself, before any other creditors
whose debts
are of equal degree .
This is a remedy by the
mere act of law, and grounded upon this reason ; that the
executor cannot , without an apparent absurdity , commence
a suit against himself as representative of the deceased , to
recover that which is due to him in his own private
capa-
city
but , having the whole personal estate in his hands ,
so much as is sufficient to answer
his own demand is , by
operation of law , applied to that particular
purpose .
Else ,
by being made executor, he would be put in a worse con-
dition than all the rest of the world besides .
For , though
a rateable payment of all the
debts
of the deceased , in
equal degree , is clearly the most equitable method , yet as

v. Darcy, Plowd. 184.

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE
WRONGS
every scheme for a proportionable
distribution
by an exe-
cutor or administrator , of the assets among all the credi-
tors has been hitherto found to be impracticable , and pro-
ductive of more mischiefs than it would
remedy ;
so that
the creditor who first commences his suit
is entitled
to a
preference in payment ; it follows , that as the
executor
can commence no suit , he must be paid
the last
of any ,
and of course must lose his debt , in case the estate
of his
testator should
prove insolvent , unless he be allowed
to
retain it.
The doctrine of retainer is therefore the neces-
sary consequence of that
other
doctrine of the law , the
priority of such creditor who first
commences
his
action .
But the
executor
shall
not retain
his
own debt , in pre-
judice to those of a higher
degree
; for the law only puts
him in the same situation , as if he had
sued
himself as
executor , and recovered his debt ; which he never could be
supposed to have done , while
debts of a higher
nature
subsisted .
Neither shall one executor be allowed to retain
his own debt , in prejudice
to that of his
co-executor in
equal
degree ; but
both
shall
be
discharged
in
propor-
tion (c).
Nor shall an executor of his own wrong be per-
mitted to retain (d) , except in the case where he becomes
so (e) through
accepting
a gift of the intestate's
effects
from an administrator
who has obtained the grant fraudu-
lently.
Whether an
executor might retain for a debt
barred by the statute was formerly in some doubt ; recent
decisions , which may be accepted
as settling the question ,
have established the right in this
case also (ƒ) .

In the analogous case

to be that there is no remitter

estate

to which would
be

where
there
are cross

If
a

rule
,
founded
upon
reason
and
justice
,
inasmuch
as
it

unnecessary
multiplication
of

and much

,
seems
to
have been adopted originally from the Roman
Law

the state-
ment
in
the Digest
(h)
of
its foundation
.
The doctrine was not
,
however
,
voluntarily
accepted
by
our courts
of
common law
,
and
in
early times its benefit
could only be obtained
in
courts
of
equity where
it
seems
to
have been always recognised
(¿).
The obviously disas-
trous
consequences
of not admitting
it
in
the event
of
the bankruptcy
of
one
of
the
parties
led
to
its recog-
nition by the legislature
in
that case
(k).
And not long
afterwards
the
same
supreme
authority
interfered
to
permit
a
set
-
off
to
be
pleaded
at
law
in
general cases

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE WRONGS
There are various rules and conditions which regulate the
application
of the doctrine , into which we cannot appro-
priately
enter here at any length .
They depend upon the
nature of the relation
existing
between the
parties
and
the character of the conflicting
claims .
Thus where the
claims are in different rights (m) , or where
one is for un-
liquidated
damages
or for tort, the other being a common
debt of fixed
amount (n),
or where the debt in respect
of which set-off is claimed
accrued after the commence-
ment of the action (0) , no set -off will be allowed , and it
would seem that set -off may not
be asserted in respect of
a debt barred by the Statutes of Limitations (p).
Courts of equity , having
a wider
cognisance of rights
and claims
than
courts of law,
are still (q )
sometimes

cases, such as lien, the statutes
are
disregarded , Spears v.Hartley, 3 Esp .

and
see Mills v. Fowkes ,

v. Waugh
(L.

296), that
a mortgagee
may retain
out of moneys
produced
by sale of
the mortgaged
properties more than
six years ' interest , notwithstanding
3 &
4 Will. 4,
c. 27, s. 42.
And
in the case of a legacy to
a debtor
whose debt is barred , it is now quite
established
that
the
executor
may
set off the legacy
against
the debt ,

It is to be observed
that
the sta-

3 & 4

away the
remedy and not the right ; the other

this takes place whatever
may be his will or
intention .
He is remitted
nolens
volens (x).
If the
subsequent
estate ,
or right
of
possession , be
gained by a man's own act or consent , as by immediate
purchase being of full age , he shall not be remitted .
For
the taking such subsequent estate was his own folly , and
shall
be looked
upon
as a waiver of his prior right (y) .
Therefore it is to be observed , that to every remitter
there
are regularly
these incidents
; an ancient right , and a new
defeasible estate of freehold in possession , uniting in one
and the same person ; which defeasible estate must be cast
upon the rightful owner not gained by his own act : except ,
indeed , in the case of an infant or married woman , against
whom the law will not adjudge folly (≈) .
The reason given
by Littleton (a) , why
this
remedy ,
which
operates
silently , and
involuntarily
, by the
mere
act of law, was allowed , is somewhat similar
to that given
for retainer ;
because
otherwise he who hath right would
be deprived of all remedy.
For as he himself is the person
in possession of the
freehold , there
is
no other person
against
whom
he
can
bring an action , to establish his
prior right.
And for this cause the law doth adjudge him
in by remitter ; that is , in such plight as if he had lawfully
recovered the
same land by suit .
For , as Lord
Bacon
observes (b) , the benignity of the law is such , as when , to
preserve the principles
and grounds of law, it depriveth a
man of his
remedy without
his own fault, it will
rather
put him in a better degree
and condition
than in a worse .
Nam quod remedio destituitur , ipsâ re valet , si culpa absit .
But there shall
be no remitter
to a right which
is extin-
guished , or for which the party has no remedy by action (c) :
as if it be barred by the Statute of Limitations

under the law as it stood prior to the act abolishing
fines ,
the issue in tail had been barred by the fine of his ancestor
and the freehold was afterwards cast upon
him ; he was
not remitted
to his estate tail (e) : for the operation of
the remitter
is exactly the same, after the union of the
two
rights, as that of a real
action
would
have
been
before it.
As therefore
the
issue in tail could not by
any action have recovered his
ancient
estate , he
could
not recover it by remitter .
Of
course under
the
pre-
sent law
there
can
be
no
remitter
to
an
estate
tail
barred
by a disentailing
assurance duly executed by the
ancestor .
Inasmuch
as the possession of one coparcener,
joint tenant , or tenant in common is not the possession of
any other (ƒ), therefore if one be remitted
to any of these
estates
no advantage accrues
to any other (g).

REDRESS
OF PRIVATE WRONGS .
Conclusion.
And thus much for these extrajudicial
remedies , as well
for real as personal
injuries , which
are furnished
or per-
mitted
by the law, where
the parties
are so
peculiarly
circumstanced , as not to make it eligible , or in some
cases
even possible , to apply for redress in the usual and ordinary
methods to the courts of public justice .

redress
by suit in court : wherein
the act of the parties court.
and the act of law co-operate
; the act of the parties being
necessary to set the law in motion , and the process
of the

by which

to
procure
a
certain
and
adequate
redress.
sory ,
And
here it will
not
be
improper
to
observe ,
that
although in the several cases of redress
by the act of the
parties mentioned in a former
chapter (a ) , the law allows
an extrajudicial
remedy , yet that remedy is not compul-
and does not exclude the ordinary
course of justice
:
it is only
an
additional
weapon put into
the
hands of
persons in particular
instances , where natural
equity
or
the
peculiar
circumstances
of their
situation
require
a
more expeditious
remedy, than the
formal
process
of a
court of judicature
can furnish .
Therefore , though I may
defend myself from external violence , I yet am afterwards
entitled
to an action of assault
and battery :
though I
may retake my goods , if I have a fair and peaceable oppor-
tunity , this
power of recaption
does
not debar me from
my action : I may either
enter on the lands , on which I
have a right of entry , or may demand possession by action :
I may either abate a nuisance by my own authority , or
call upon the law to do it for me : I may distrain for rent ,

And with regard
to

either of
these, being in its nature
merely an agreement
or com-
promise , indisputably
supposes
a previous right of obtain-
ing redress some
other way ; which
is given
up by such
agreement .
And as to remedies by operation of law, those
are indeed given , because
no remedy can be administered
by suit
or
action , without
running
into the
palpable
absurdity of a man's bringing an action against himself :
the two
cases wherein
they happen being
such , that the
only
possible
legal
remedy would
have to
be directed.
against the very person who seeks relief .
Otherwise , however , it is a rule , that where there is a
legal right, there is a legal remedy , by suit in court or by
application
to a court of justice , whenever that right is
invaded .
And in treating
of such remedy , I shall
now
consider the nature of courts in general ; and shall after-
wards
inquire
as to the
several
species
of
courts ,
the
jurisdiction of
each , and
the
method of obtaining
the
redress which it affords .
A court is defined
to
be
a place wherein
justice
is
judicially administered (b).
And , as by our constitution
the
sole
executive
power of the laws is vested in the
person of the
sovereign , courts of justice , which
are the
medium by which
he administers
the laws ,
are
derived
from the power of the crown (c).
For , whether
created
by act of parliament , or letters
patent , or subsisting
by
prescription
(the
only
methods
by which
any
court of
judicature
can exist (d)) , the
royal
consent in the
two
former is expressly , and in the latter is impliedly , given .

COURTS
OF
RECORD .
21
In these courts the sovereign is supposed in contemplation
of law to be always
present ; or at least is there
repre-
sented by the judges , whose power
is but
an emanation
of the prerogative .
For the more
speedy
and impartial
administration
of
justice between subject and subject , the law has appointed
various
courts , some with a more limited , others with a
more extensive jurisdiction ; some constituted
to inquire
only, others to hear and determine ;
some to determine in
the first instance , others upon appeal .
These will be taken
notice of in their respective places : and here one distinc-
tion only that runs throughout
them need be noticed ; viz.
between courts of record
and courts
not of record .
A of record ;
court of record is that , whose acts
and judicial proceedings
are enrolled
for a perpetual
memorial
and
testimony :
which rolls are called the records of the court , and are of
such high and super-eminent
authority , that their
truth
is not to be called in question .
For it is a settled rule
and maxim that nothing
shall be averred against a record ,
nor shall
any plea , or even
proof, unless where fraud is
involved , be admitted
to the contrary (e).
And if the
existence of a record be denied , it shall be tried by nothing
but itself : that is,
upon
bare inspection whether
there
be any such record
or
no ;
else
there would
be
no end
of disputes .
But , if there
appear any
mistake
of the
clerk
in
making
up
such
record ,
the
court
will
di-
rect him
to amend it.
All courts of record
are said to
be the queen's courts , in right of her crown
and royal
dignity (ƒ) , and no other
court has authority to fine or
imprison
for a contempt ;
so that
the very erection of
a new jurisdiction with such power makes it a court of
record (g).

the court -baron incident
to
a
manor ,
where the proceedings are not enrolled
or recorded ; but
as well their existence as the truth of the matters therein
contained may , if disputed , be tried
and determined by a
jury .
In every court there must be three constituent parts , the
actor, reus, and judex : the
actor , or plaintiff, who com-
plains of an injury done
; the
reus , or defendant , who is
called upon to make satisfaction for it ; and the judex, or
judicial power , whose
duty it is to examine the
truth of
the fact , to determine the law arising upon that fact , and ,
if any injury appears
to have been
done , to ascertain , and
by its officers
to apply the remedy.
It is also usual in a
court of justice
to have attornies
or solicitors , and advo-
cates or counsel , as assistants .
An attorney at law, or a solicitor , answers to the procu-
rator , or proctor , of the civilians
and canonists (h), and is
one put in the place, stead , or turn of another , to manage
his matters of law .
Formerly every suitor was obliged
to
appear in person, to prosecute or defend
his
suit , unless
by
special
licence
under
the
king's
letters
patent (¿) .
And an idiot cannot at this
day appear by attorney , but
must
do so in person (k), for he has not
discretion
to
enable him to appoint
a proper substitute .
But , as in the
Roman law, " cum olim in usu fuisset , alterius nomine agi
non posse, sed, quia hoc non minimam incommoditatem
habe-
bat,
cæperunt
homines
per procuratores
litigare " (1) ,
so
with
us , upon
the

principle
of convenience , it was
permitted

ancient

Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal to King Charles II. ( 8) .
These
queen's counsel answer , in some measure, to the advocates
of the revenue , advocati fisci, among the Romans .
For
they must not be employed in any cause against the crown
without
special
licence : in which
restriction
they agree
with the advocates of the fisc (t) : but in the imperial law
the prohibition
was carried still further , and perhaps was
more for the dignity of the
sovereign ;
for ,
excepting
some
peculiar
causes , the fiscal
advocates
were not per-
mitted to be at all concerned
in private suits between sub-
ject and subject (u) .
A custom has for many years pre-
vailed of granting
letters
patent of precedence
to
such
barristers , as the crown thinks proper to honour with that
mark of distinction : whereby they are entitled
to
such
rank and pre-audience as are assigned in their
respective
patents.
These,
as well
as the attorney
and solicitor-
general ( v) , rank promiscuously
with the king's counsel ,
and together with them sit within the bar of the respec-
tive courts ; but
receive no salaries , and
are
not
sworn ;
and therefore are at liberty to be retained in causes against
the crown .
And all other serjeants and barristers
indis-
criminately
may take upon themselves the protection
and
defence
of suitors , who are
therefore
called their
clients ,
as were the dependants upon the ancient
Roman
orators .
Those indeed practised

honour
merely , or
at
most for the sake of gaining
influence : and
so
likewise
it is established with

demand without doing wrong to his
reputation (y) ; as is
also laid down with regard to advocates
in the civil law (≈) ,
whose honorarium was directed by a decree of the
senate
not to exceed in any case ten thousand
sesterces , or about
801. of English money (a).
A counsel accordingly
is to be considered not as making
a contract with
his client , which
he is incapacitated
from
doing (6), but as taking
upon himself an office
or duty in
the proper discharge of which not merely his
client , but
the court in which
the duty is to be performed , and the
public at large have an interest .
The general conduct of,
and control
over , the cause are necessarily left to counsel ,
and he has complete authority
over the suit , the mode of
conducting it, and all that is incident to it ; but not over
matters
collateral
thereto (c).
Moreover ,
in
order
to
encourage due freedom of speech in the lawful
defence
of
their
clients , and at the
same time to give a check to the
unseemly
licentiousness
of prostitute
and illiberal
men
(a
few of whom
may
sometimes
insinuate
themselves
even into the
most
honourable
professions ) , it has been
held
that a
counsel
is not
answerable
for
any matter
by him spoken , relative
to the
cause in hand , and sug-
gested in his
client's
instructions
;
although
it
should
reflect
upon the reputation
of another ,
and
even
prove
absolutely
groundless : but if he maliciously
mentions
an untruth of his
own invention ,
not
pertinent
to the
cause , he may be liable to an action at suit of the party
injured (d) .

Having thus
briefly adverted to courts in general , we
are next to consider the several species of courts by which
justice

country-the juris-

THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
Derivation
THE
name of chancery , cancellaria , and of the judge Chancery.
who presides there , the Lord Chancellor , or Cancellarius , of
the
word
.
is
derived
,
according
to
sir Edward Coke
,
and other ancient
authorities
(a),
from cancello
,
because
the highest exercise
of
his
office
is
to
cancel the king's letters
patent when
granted
contrary
to
law
,
a
patent
or
other record being
vacated by drawing

The
office and name of chancellor

Office
of
was certainly known
to
the Roman
emperors
,
with whom
it
originally
seems
to
have signified
a
chief
scribe
or
secretary
,
who was afterwards an officer
,
to
whose functions
there
were gradually
added several judicial
powers
,
to-
gether with
a
general
superintendency
over
the
other
officers of the prince
.
The Roman Church adopted
,
amongst other
accessories
of
imperial
state
,
this
office
,
and
hence
every bishop
has
to
this day his chancellor
,
the principal
judge
of
his
con-
sistory
court
.
When the modern
kingdoms
of
Europe
were
established
upon the
ruins
of
the empire
,
almost
every state preserved
its
chancellor
,
but the jurisdictions
.
and dignities
varied
in
the different
states
according
to
their
several constitutions
.
In all of them he seems to

cated in the most
solemn manner ; when , therefore , the
use of seals
was adopted, in or about the time of Edward
the Confessor (c) , the custody of the king's great seal was
naturally
entrusted to the chancellor , and with him it has
ever since remained (d).
In the present day , the office of
Lord Chancellor
is created by the mere delivery
of the
great seal into
his
custody ; he thereby
becomes
, with-
out writ or patent , an officer of the greatest weight
and
power of any now subsisting in the kingdom , and supe-
rior in point of precedency
to every temporal lord , except
the king's
sons , brothers , nephews , and uncles (e) .
He
is
invariably
made
a privy
councillor , if not
so
pre-
viously (ƒ) ; he is virtute
officii
prolocutor , or mouthpiece
of the House of Lords , whether a peer or not (g) , presiding
as well over
its
legislative
as
its judicial sittings
.
To him
belongs
the
appointment
of
all justices
of
the
peace
throughout
the kingdom
.
Being
,
in
early times
,
usually an ecclesiastic
(
for none
else were then capable
of
an office
involving much know-
ledge
of
letters
),
and presiding
over the royal
chapel
(4),
he became

and
is

of
the king's
conscience

He
is
also visitor

all hospitals
and colleges

tion

patron-
age, in early times , extended
to all of the king's livings
whose
annual
value
was 20
marks
or
under ,
and was
chiefly exercised in favour of the clerks in chancery , who
were
usually
ecclesiastics ( ) :
afterwards ,
the
right of
presentation , without
any restriction , was
assumed
by the
chancellors , and livings up to the
value of
207.
in
the
king's book ( ) were included in this right, which has con-
tinued to the present day ;
the livings
being in fact now
looked
upon
and dealt with, even by the legislature , as
if the advowsons were vested
in the Lord Chancellor
as a
corporation .
The Lord Chancellor
is , by the jurisdiction
inherent to
his
office , the general guardian of all infants , idiots , and
lunatics
(k) , and
has the general
superintendence
of all
charitable
foundations ( ) .
The
duties
arising
from this
position
of guardianship
and
superintendence
are
now
shared by other judges , and , moreover , have, by recent
legislature , been
lessened
by the
establishment of other
functionaries (m).

Commentaries ,

In order
to
make
provision
for the augmenta-
tion of the value of the
chancellor's
livings, an
act
has
been
recently
passed to authorise
the lord chan-
cellor to sell the
advowsons
of cer-
tain livings, the price being applied
in increasing
their value .

which a large
number

In addition
to all these
functions , the Lord Chancellor
is the chief judge in the Court of Chancery , wherein there
are two courts ; the one ordinary , being a court of common
law, the other extraordinary , being a court of equity (») .
The Court
Though
the Court of Chancery , in the most ancient times ,
was a court of record , for letters
patent under the great
seal
seal were, and are always , recorded
in the court (0) , it was
not originally a court where justice
was administered
; but
from the very earliest times , out of the Court of Chancery ,
which
has from this circumstance
been
called
officina
brevium
and officina justitiæ , there have issued writs under
the great seal directed to the king's justices
or the sheriffs
to give such remedy as the occasion required (p) . When the
circumstances
of a case
were similar
to others that had
preceded it , old established forms were , by the rule of the
court , adopted ; but when new cases
arose , which
could
not be dealt with under
any existing
form
of action , in
order to prevent
the harsh or imperfect judgment
which
might otherwise
ensue ,
a new form of writ was sought
for.
This was the custom not only among our Saxon ances-
tors before the institution of the Aula Regia (q) , but also
endowed

risdiction , see Governors ofthe Cha-
rity for Relief of

tinued

The
chief judicial
employment
of the
chancellor
in
these
very
early
times , therefore , must
have
been
in
devising , with
the
assistance of his
clerks , new
writs
directed to the courts of common law, to give remedy in
cases where none was before administered
(t) .
To quicken
the diligence of the clerks in chancery , who were supposed
to be too much
attached to ancient precedents , it is pro-
vided by the statute of Westminster
the second
( 13 Edw . Statute of
1 , c. 24 ) , that " whensoever from thenceforth
a writ shall ster 2.
be found in the chancery , and in a like case falling under
the same right , and requiring
like remedy , no precedent
of a writ can be produced , the clerks in chancery shall
agree in forming
a new one : and if they cannot agree , it
shall
be adjourned
to the next parliament , where a writ
shall be framed by consent of the learned in the law (u),
lest it happen for the future that the court of our lord the
relief was granted was by plaint to
the king, who , with the assistance
ofhis chancellor or secretary , framed
a writ or letters to the judges
: the
most ancient
form of such writ be-
ing as follows
:-" Rex , &c. (to the
judge .)
Questus est nobis , A. quod
B., &c., et ideo tibi (vices nostras in

OF CHANCERY .
king be deficient in doing justice to the suitors : " and the
statute gives a variety
of new precedents of writs ,
some
of them for
cases
previously
unprovided
for .
Thus
is
accounted for the number of writs of trespass on the case
to be met with in the ancient register , whereby the suitor
had relief according
to the exigency , and adapted to the
special circumstances and justice of his case (x) .
In process
of time , however , the chancellor
came to do
more than furnish the first
ingredients
of judicial action ;
he always sat as a member of the Aula Regia , and was
accustomed generally
to attend the king in person for the
purpose ,
amongst
other
things , of giving him
advice ;
indeed , he was doubtless
the principal legal adviser
on
all occasions.
It was natural , therefore , that he should
early take cognizance of some legal
matters , and especi-
ally
those
connected with rights
depending
upon
the
king's grants , since he, being the holder of the great seal ,
was the officer through
whom they
had
been
obtained .
Thus
arose
the ancient
common law jurisdiction
of the
tion of the
chancellor .
It is not possible to fix with exactness
the
time when it may be said first to have been completely
established , but its authority
is recognised in very early

As a court of justice , it has now almost reached a fossil

as to issuing a

has been
called
into exercise in times
much
more
recent than that of Edward
I.
See
The Rioters' Case, 1 Vern . 175.
(y) Lord Campbell
supposes that
the chancellor , during the existence
of the Aula Regia ,practically
decided
questions
similar
to
those
which
were afterwards
recognised as com-
ing within his common law juris-
diction , by that court referring
such
questions for his
opinion
; and
he
concludes that when the Aula Regia
was broken
up, the
chancellor
as-
sumed the jurisdiction
, and
so es-
tablished

Much
of
this jurisdiction
of
the chancellor
seems
but
natural
,
because
,
since the king can never be supposed
to
do any wrong
,
if
any error
be
proved
to
have arisen
whereby
a
subject has
suffered
,
the law
assumes
that
,
on due
proof
of
it
,
he
will
give
immediate
redress
,
and
a
conscientious
task like this would
,
of
course
,
be
performed
by the
chancellor
,
the
keeper
of
his
con-
science
.
The jurisdiction
of
the court extended over all personal
actions
where
any officer
or
minister
of
the
court was
a
party
,
over partitions
(
by scire facias
)
of
lands
in
co-
parcenary
(e),
and
,
whilst
military tenures
existed
,
over
claims
for dower where any ward of the court was con-
cerned
in
interest
(f
).
It
afterwards retained jurisdiction
in cases
relating
to
tithes
of
forest land
,
where granted
by the
king
,
and
claimed
by
a
stranger
against
the
grantee
of
the crown
(g

and over executions

cause

as

,

The practice
of
issuing the same writ

,
seems
to
have first
been es-
tablished

nature of statutes , by the
statute 23 Hen. VIII . , c. 6 (h) .
The proceedings in a suit in the common law court , when
it was more used than is now the case , were not dissimilar
to common law actions elsewhere. If, however , any cause
came to issue , that is, if any fact were disputed
between
the parties , the chancellor having no power to summon a
jury , could not try it (2) , he then must
deliver the record
or a transcript of the record , propriâ manu , into the Court
of King's Bench , where it could be tried by the country ,
and judgment
given thereon (k).
When judgment
was given in chancery upon demurrer
or the like, a writ of error in the nature of an appeal lay
out of this
ordinary
court into the
King's
Bench (7).
This
right of appeal has been
so little
exercised
, how-
ever , that

that he could find no

(i) The recent Act, 21 & 22 Vict .
c. 27, s. 3, gives the Court of Chan-
cery
power
to
summon
a jury.
That Act , though
probably
not in-
tended
to affect
procedure
in
the
Petty Bag
Office , still , is
not in
terms
confined
to the
equity
side
of the
court , and would
therefore ,
seemingly ,
enable
a suit
in
the
Petty Bag
Office to be
completely
tried
there .
By the
Chancery
Re-
gulation
Act,
1862 (25 & 26 Vict .
c. 42) it is made obligatory
upon
the
court
to
decide
questions
of
fact (s. 1),
unless it can
be
more
conveniently
tried elsewhere

The proceedings in this court as a court of justice have,
even in these few suits which we have mentioned ,
been
long confined to the
formal
proceedings ,

as
the
pleadings , the substantial trial of the merits being in the

the Hanaper
Petty Bag.
There have always been two
branches of this common
Courts of
law court , one called the Court of the Hanaper , the other and of
the
the Court of the Petty Bag
.
In the former
,
writs relating
to
the business
of
the subject
,
and the returns
to
them
,
were kept according
to
the simplicity
of
ancient times
,
in
a
hamper
(
in
hanaperio
).
In
the latter
,
those relating
to
matters wherein the crown was immediately
or
mediately
concerned
,
were preserved
in
a
little bag
.
The distinction
.
between the two branches still exists
,
though
the Petty
Bag
is
the
branch
in
which
,
for obvious
reasons
,
most
vitality remains
.
From
it
issue writs
of
what
may be
called
a
ministerial
nature
,
such
,
for instance
,
as
writs of
election issued on calling
a
new parliament
,
writs
of

d'élire for the appointment
of
bishops
and archbishops
.
In the Petty Bag Office

are kept the

THE
COURT
OF CHANCERY .
persons are hardly , if at all,
aware that
the
Court of
Chancery possesses
any judicial or administrative
functions
other than its equitable
ones .
Recent
legislation
has
so
far modified the practice , and
added
to the duties of the
equitable
side
of the
court ,
that
the
business
trans-
acted by it equals in extent
that
of the common
law
courts .
The distinction
between law and equity , as administered
in
different
courts in England , is not at present known ,
and seems not to have ever been known
in other
coun-
tries (o), though
the
difference
of one from the other ,
when
administered
by the
same tribunal , was perfectly
familiar to the Romans (p), the jus prætorium , or discre-
tion of the prætor , being distinct from the leges or stand-
ing laws (q) ; but the power of both centred in one and the
same magistrate , who was equally entrusted to pronounce
the rule of law, and to apply it to particular
cases by the
principles of equity .
With us, too , the Aula Regia , presided over by the chief
justiciar, which was the supreme court of judicature , and
in which all cases of importance were tried , undoubtedly
administered
equal justice
according to the rule of both
law and
equity ,
or
either ,
as
the
case
might
require .
When this court was
broken
up , though
there was
no
formal establishment of a court of equity , yet it is pro-
bable that some desire for freedom from the
trammels
of
strict legal
procedure would
often be felt, which

courts , and moderate them by equity
(Mod . Un . Hist . xxii . 237), seemsto
have been rather
a court of appeal
than
a court
of distinct
jurisdic-
tion .
(p) Thus too
the
Parliament

THE
EQUITABLE
SIDE .
37
would scarcely
be
disregarded .
Still ,
though
Bracton
mentions
equity as a thing
contrasted to strict
law (q) ,
neither
that writer
nor Glanvil , nor the author of Fleta ,
nor even Britton
(who wrote under the auspices , and in
the name of Edward I. , treating particularly of courts and
their several jurisdictions
) , mentions anything
about the
chancellor's equitable jurisdiction.
Probably it was with the view of satisfying
this
desire
that the statute of Westminster
the
Second was
passed ,
which ,
by the
ready issue of suitable
writs , and with a
little elasticity on the part of the judges , might probably
have
answered every purpose ;
indeed , opinions
to this
effect have
been
expressed
by eminent judges (r) .
The
only real want which might then have remained
unsatis-
fied
would
have been that of obtaining
discovery upon
oath from the defendant (s) .
It
seems , however,
that
notwithstanding
the varied
forms of actions
so devised , and the means afforded for
further developement , courts of law, through
a too rigor-
ous adherence
to established forms , and the
letter
rather
than
the spirit of law, still fell short
of administering
that complete
relief which
a
natural
sense
of justice
seemed
to require .
No satisfactory reason
can
be given
why this should
have been the case ; certainly in modern
times courts of law do not exhibit the same narrowness of
spirit, and they have long rejected some of the old rigid
rules : still , they have, naturally , been
unable
in many
instances
entirely
to disregard
the
authority
of ancient
precedents,
and it is but very recently
that
they
have

requisite
for
the
attainment
of justice

THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
received any adequate
aid from the legislature . But , what-
ever may have been the reason , a court of equity was found
to be a necessity , if complete justice was to be obtained .
An important
influence towards
its establishment
came
into operation , when in the 14th century (t) there grew
up
new
doctrines
concerning
the
holding
and
enjoy-
ment of property ,
separating
the
legal
title from the
right to the
beneficial
enjoyment
of it, in imitation to
some extent of the
usufructus
of
Roman
law, though
arising
out of
causes
peculiar
to the
age .
With
the
growth of these doctrines there arose
a necessity or desire
for the judicial recognition of trusts or uses , as they were
commonly called (u).
The
device of one person having
the legal dominion over property , but bound to allow
an-
other to have the full benefit of it , was found to meet and
overcome several
obstacles which the law had
imposed
upon the disposition
of landed
property .
Of these, per-
haps , the most
notable was the
law of mortmain , pro-
hibiting lands
from
being
given for religious
purposes .
Ecclesiastical
chancellors ,
therefore ,
readily
sanctioned
the plan of avoiding
these statutes , by vesting
the legal
estate
of
lands
in persons to the
use of the
religious
houses , and then , by binding
the conscience
of the legal
owner to give effect to the use .
And since the jurisdiction
to enforce this obligation
was refused by court of law (e),
it was assumed by the Court of Chancery .

Chancery , by which the feoffee to uses was made account-

(u) It has been commonly thought
that the jurisdiction over trusts was
one of the principal
causes of the
equitable jurisdiction being assumed
by the Court of
Chancery .
Lord
Campbell ,
however ,
gives
reasons
for believing
that it did not play so
important
a part in this matter
as
was supposed .
Still it must
have
had much to do with the determina-
tion with which
the chancellors
ad-
hered to their power when once as-
sumed .

THE WRIT

able to his cestui que use is ascribed to the " subtilty " of
John de Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury , and chancellor to
Richard II. (x).
This writ ,
requiring
the
defendant to
appear to
and answer a bill of complaint in the Court of
Chancery , continued from that time until very recently , to
be the foundation
of a chancery suit .
It was originally
framed under a strained construction
of the
above -quoted
statute of Westminster
the Second ; but the process having
been found
to answer well the
ends of those who used
it, the practice of issuing it was
soon
extended
to many
cases , even to some which were properly
determinable
at
common law ; a false and fictitious
suggestion being made
in the bill that
common law furnished
no relief.
To re-
medy this , which
was thought
to be an evil , the statute
17 Rich. 2 , c. 6 , was passed , by which the chancellor
was
directed to award damages
to the party unjustly vexed by
such a proceeding .
It may be noticed that the clergy so
early as the reign of King Stephen had attempted to turn
their ecclesiastical courts into courts of equity , by enter-
taining suits , pro
læsione fidei,
as
a
spiritual
offence
against
conscience
, in
case of non-payment of debts
or
breach of civil contract (y) , and these attempts
were
con-
tinued till they were checked by the Constitution
of Cla-
rendon (2), which
declared that " placita de
debitis

From the in-
vention
of trusts
and the
exclusive
control which
the
court
of equity
took of them , there naturally grew
up that vast administrative
business
by which family estates and
pro-
perty
are
preserved
and
managed
under
the
direction
of the
court ,
which now occupies so large
a por-
tion of its attention .
The policy of
recent legislation
is to continually
add to this part of the
court's
du-
ties , the exercise
of judicial discre-
tion being clearly most beneficial
to
those persons who occupy the
posi-
tion of guardians , and those
(such
as infants ) who are entitled
to the
enjoyment ,
yet
incapable
of the

Yet even after this enactment the spi-
ritual courts continued to grasp at the same authority (a)
down to so late
a time
as the fifteenth
century (6) , till
finally prohibited
by the unanimous
consent of all the
judges .
The fact is undoubted , and the reasons
are
sufficiently
apparent , that the chancellors clung to, and sought to ex-
tend , the jurisdiction which
they had acquired , and they
succeeded
in doing
this , notwithstanding
that
repeated
efforts were made to put an end to their power .
We find
that in the reigns
of Henry IV. and Henry V. (c) , there
were several petitions
presented by the commons to the
king, urging the suppression of the writ of subpoena
as a
novelty contrary to the form of the common law, whereby , as
they declared , no plea could be determined unless by ex-
amination
and oath of the parties , according to the form
of the civil law , and the law of holy
church , but
in
sub-
version of the common law.
Henry IV. , feeling
perhaps
not too secure
on his throne , evaded
these
requisitions , or
even , to some extent , acceded
to them (d) ;
but Henry V.
gave a decided negative to the application , and the process
by writ of subpoena
and bill in chancery then
became ,

and continued
to
be , until the year
1852 (e) , the daily
practice
of the
court , its application
being
constantly
extended .
Equitable
jurisdiction of some kind
was ,
no
doubt ,
exercised before the time of John
de Waltham's
writ , but
it seems to have been the first instance of process
issued
out of the Court of Chancery without
special commission
from
the king, or special authority
derived from
parlia-
ment (ƒ) , for the purpose of enforcing equitable rights by
the authority of that court alone.
Thus was established ,
in addition to his ordinary power (potentia ordinata ) , the
extraordinary
or absolute power (potentia
absoluta ) (g) of
the chancellor , in the
exercise of which
he disregarded
the ordinary rules of procedure in courts of law (h) , adopted
such means, by examination
on oath of the parties
or
otherwise , as seemed
best calculated to discover the truth ,
and enforced obedience to his
decrees
by imprisonment .
The chancellors did not , and probably felt that they could
not , assume all the powers which were exercised by courts
of law ; such, for instance , as summoning
a jury to deter-
mine questions of fact , and this became one of the principal
defects of the court , which
have recently
been
rectified .
In its judgment , the Court
of Chancery , whilst adhering
to those rules of law which were consonant with principles
of equity ,
boldly
overruled
those
rules
or
maxims
of
almost
absurd
and fanciful
rigour which
had
been laid
down and pertinaciously
adhered to by judges , notwith-

standing that through the accidents or necessities of social
life they in fact often worked great injustice (?).
The relief given , as compared with that now obtained ,
did not , however , for
a long time extend very far ; for in
the ancient treatise entitled
Diversité
des
courtes , or Di-
versity of courts and their jurisdictions
(k) , written
by an
unknown
author in the time of King Henry the Eighth ,
we have a catalogue of the matters of conscience then
cognisable in chancery , and
these fall within
a very short
range (1) .
No regular judicial system or rules of equity
at that time prevailed in the court. A suitor who thought
himself aggrieved
could but
obtain
a desultory
and un-
certain
remedy according to the
private
opinion
of the
chancellor (m ) , generally , and as we have already remarked
in very early times
always ,
an ecclesiastic ,
sometimes ,
though rarely , a statesman , scarcely ever
a lawyer .

committed
to the
custody of lawyers , cour-

as the convenience
of the
moment , or the caprice of the sovereign , might
require ,

time to the present the Court of

But it is only in
very recent
times that
men have, as a general
rule , been
made judges in the Court of Chancery who have specially

Equity lawyers are of very modern extraction (r) .

judge strenuously contended against the assumption which
was made on the part of a court of equity to restrain by
injunction
, i. e. , on pain of imprisonment
, a complainant
at law from pursuing
his remedy at law, and reaping
the
fruits of his success .
This
contest , which
took
place when
Lord Ellesmere
was chancellor
(A.D.
1616 ) , was
so
warmly
carried
on ,
that
indictments
were preferred
against
the
suitors , the
solicitors , the counsel , and even
a master in chancery , for
having incurred
a præmunire
by questioning in a court of
equity a judgment
in the Court of King's Bench obtained
by gross fraud and imposition (s).
This matter being brought
before the king , was by him
referred to his learned counsel for their advice and opinion ,
who
reported
so
strongly
in
favour
of
the
courts of
equity (t) ,
that
his
majesty
gave
judgment
on their
behalf ;
but,
as might be expected from King James's
character , he, not content with the irrefragable
reasons
and
precedents
produced by his
counsel (for the chief
justice was clearly in the wrong ) , chose
rather
to decide
the question by referring it to the plenitude of his
royal
prerogative (u) .

sion (x) , and thereby made atonement for his error ; but

relative to the commissioners
of sewers in insisting upon
their being
subject to the control of the Court of King's
Bench were the open and
avowed
causes (2) first
of his
suspension and then of his removal from office .
Lord Bacon , who
succeeded
Lord Ellesmere ,
reduced
the practice of the court to a more regular
system
(a) ;
but
did
not sit long
enough
to effect any
considerable
revolution
in the science of equitable jurisprudence
itself,
and few of his
decrees that
have reached us
are
of any
great consequence
to posterity .
His successors , in the reign of Charles I. , did little to
improve
upon his plan.
Lord Clarendon , when the seal
was committed to him, had withdrawn
from practice as a
lawyer nearly twenty years (b), and the Earl of Shaftes-
bury , who received
it on Clarendon's fall , though
a lawyer
by education , had never practised at all.
But somewhat
later there was a change, when , in
1673 , Sir Heneage
Finch , afterwards Earl of Nottingham
, became
chancellor .
He was a person of the greatest abilities and most incor-
ruptible
integrity , a thorough master and zealous defender
of the laws and constitution
of his country .
His genius
enabled him to discover the true spirit of justice , notwith-
standing
any embarrassments
raised by the narrow
and
be contrary to their oath
and the
law.
But upon
being
brought
be-
fore the king and
council
they all
retracted and promised
obedience in
every such case for the future , except
sir
Edward
Coke , who said , " that
when the case happened
he would
do his duty."

THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
technical
notions
prevailing
in
courts of law,
and the
imperfect
ideas of redress then
recognised
in courts of
equity .
The reason and necessities of mankind , arising
from
the great
change in property by the
extension of
trade, and the
abolition
of military tenures , co -operated
in establishing
his plan , and
enabled
him to build up , in
the course of nine years , a system of jurisprudence
and
jurisdiction
upon
wide
and
rational
foundations .
This
has been extended and improved
by the many great men
who
have since presided in chancery , and constitutes
a
noble
monument
to
their
memory ,
monumentum
ære
perennius .
The great variety in the necessities, the desires ,
and the habits
of society, and the craft of men follow-
ing the increase
of riches ,
rendered the
comparatively
simple
procedure of courts
of law inadequate
for the
complete
administration
, though
often well adapted
to
the ordinary
administration
of justice ; and this led , as
we see, to the application
for an adequate
remedy to the
jurisdiction of the Court
of Equity , and thereby to the
establishment of that jurisdiction.
Now this application
was always in the form of a petition of the party aggrieved ,
stating the grievance , the defect of remedy in the courts
of common law, and mentioning
the remedy which it was
conceived ought
to be administered .
By the
nature of
most of such cases , a part of this remedy consisted in the
unravelment
of a long
chain of fraud , the
examination
of complicated
accounts , or the
administration
of large
properties ;
the
mere enumeration of these seems
sug-
gestive of cumbrous machinery , and it must
be admitted
as a fact , that the procedure which
grew up in the court ,
though
powerful
to redress wrong , was also often , and
this from an almost excess of caution , attended with such
delay and
expense
as almost
to defeat its
own objects.
This was
a grievance
not likely to
escape
the reforming
spirit of the present
century .
It was easily recognised
that whilst the motive vital power of the court might
be
developed and expanded , the weight
of its
machinery ,

which bore it down and diminished
its efficacy, might
be
with safety lessened .
Accordingly
, in 1824 , a royal com-
mission was appointed to consider whether any alterations
might
advantageously
be made in
the
practice
of the
court
so as to abridge
the
expense and time
attending
proceedings in
the
court .
This
commission , in
1826 ,
made an elaborate report , and since that time
numerous
statutes
have been passed for the purpose of remodelling
the procedure , and correcting
errors , or
supplying
defi-
ciencies in the various offices of the court (c). By abolish-
ing many useless
forms and requisitions , due to an over
anxiety for the prevention
of injustice , by retaining
only
those rules of practice which involve the essence of the ad-
ministration
of justice , by adding
further
powers to the
court , a reform has been carried out to such an extent that
we may safely affirm , that at the present day the Court of
Chancery is nearly as free from reproach on the score of
useless
formalities , expense , and delay , which bring disap-
pointment to the suitor , as it has ever been in regard to the
purity of the principles governing
its decisions .
We shall
presently recur to this
subject in the course of giving an
outline
of the present procedure by suit.
We have , in
what we have said , sufficiently
traced in outline the history
of the establishment
of the
court
as a court of equity ,
presided over by the Chancellor , Lord Keeper , or Lords
Commissioners
for the custody of the great
seal ( d ) .
It
remains to say somewhat concerning the other officers and
the present subdivision of judicial labour .

The Master Master of the Rolls , to whom the custody of the records ,
or rolls of the court , was entrusted . It appears , however ,
that his duties always extended beyond those merely of a
conservator to the superintendence of the issue of writs (ƒ) ,
and there seems no doubt that he in very early times took
part in the judicial administration
, not only of the
com-
mon law, but also of the equity
side of the
court (g) ,
though
as to the exact extent of his
authority
there has
been much controversy (h) ; but it is certain that he in later
times
acted as
a judge , subordinate
in authority
to the
Chancellor , his decisions being
subject in some degree to
modification by the Chancellor .
In order to remove the
doubt
as to his
authority
in
hearing
and
determining
causes , an act was passed in the reign of Geo . II. (3 Geo .
2, c. 30) , by which it was declared that
all
orders
and
decrees
made by him, except such as by the course of the
court were appropriated to the great seal alone , should be
deemed
to be valid , subject nevertheless to be discharged
or altered by the Lord
Chancellor , so as they should
not
be inrolled until signed by his lordship .
The business dis-
posed of by him continued , however , to be of limited cha-
racter (i) until another
act, passed
more recently

OF CHANCERY .
The Vice-
Court of

Court
of
Chancellors. Chancery ,
two
more
Vice - Chancellors
were
appoin-
ted.
At that time the Master of the Rolls had complete
authority
to
hear
and
determine
causes
at
all
their
stages , so that there were thus constituted
four
courts of
primary jurisdiction of equal authority , but the decisions
of all subject to appeal .
The business of hearing appeals
from these courts of
primary
jurisdiction
soon
became
the principal
duty of the Lord Chancellor , whilst sitting
in chancery , and he has for some time confined his atten-
tion almost exclusively to it.
The labour of this appellate
business
is now shared by two judges , called
the Lords
Justices of the Court
of Appeal
in
Chancery , who , with
the Lord Chancellor , now form
the Court of Appeal
in
Chancery .
This court was constituted in the year 1851
(n) ;
it possesses
and exercises all the jurisdiction
previously
possessed
by the Lord Chancellor , and exercises
and per-
forms all powers , authorities , and duties , as well minis-
terial
as judicial , incident
to such jurisdiction
, and also
any which recent legislation
may have added
to those for-
merly
belonging
to the
Lord Chancellor
sitting in the
Court of Chancery .
The functions of the Court of Appeal may be exercised
not only by the full court of the three judges , but by the
Lord Chancellor
alone (who , it may be observed , retained
his
former
jurisdiction
unaffected (o)) ,
or by the Lord
Chancellor
sitting with one Lord Justice , or by the Lords
Justices sitting together , apart from the Lord Chancellor (p) .
And by a still more recent act, power is given
to each of
the Lords Justices to sit separately as a Court of Appeal ,
for the purpose
of
hearing
appeals from
interlocutory
orders of the primary
courts (q).

Courts of equity have by recent
acts
been

enabled
(r) and required (s) to determine questions of law
in cases where it was the old practice
to require
them to
be decided by a common law court ; moreover , the novel
power has been given (t) to summon juries for the deter-
mination of questions of fact
and the assessment
of da-
mages , in certain cases , instead of granting
an injunction
against breach of contract
or continuance
of a wrongful
act ,
or of granting
specific performance
of
a
contract .
These enactments , by giving the
Court
of Chancery the
power of dealing with a
case in the same manner
as a
court of law would
do , render
its
powers , in such
cases ,
as complete
as those
possessed
by the
Roman
Prætors .
Again , by another
act (u),
courts
of common law have
power given them to a limited
extent to deal with equit-
able grounds of defence

in some cases , similar
relief by injunction
to that which
the Court of Chancery alone previously granted .
It must not , however , be supposed that by the
changes
we have just
mentioned , the
Court of Chancery has be-

alone the court could formerly grant , and unless there is a
proper case for such relief, the court will not interfere .
A
similar remark applies to the common law courts .
They
have only a limited
power of dealing with equitable doc-
trines .
Besides , the practice and mode of procedure , as we
shall
hereafter
see, are still
entirely distinct .
There is ,
therefore , at present , no fusion
of the two courts , and it
remains
equally
important , now
as
formerly ,
to
under-
stand the
distinction
between law and
equity ,
and
the
nature of the
redress
obtained
in
one court
and in the
other .
To explain the principles
which govern a court of
equity ,
and
regulate
its
decisions ,
and
which
are
not
recognised by a court of law as
legal
doctrines ,
and to
show the character of the relief which
a court of equity
gives
as distinguished
from
that which
is obtained in a
court of common law, will be our next task .
It is , how-
ever ,
one of great difficulty ,
because
we are
necessarily
precluded
from
giving that
complete
and
exhaustive
account of the doctrines of equitable jurisprudence , which
alone will completely
separate
and distinguish
those doc-
trines on the
one
side from the more rigid rules adopted
in common law,
and
on the other
from the principles
of natural
morality , which
must
be left to the enforce-
ment
of
the
conscience
alone ,
such
as
charity ,
or
gratitude .



CHAPTER V.
THE EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF
THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
In the course of tracing
the
history
of the Court of
Chancery
as a court with equitable
jurisdiction
, it
has
been inevitable
that we should
occasionally refer to some
of the
principles
of equity
which
govern
its decisions .
The subject is , however , worthy
of some
further
notice.
But
since equitable jurisprudence
, as now established , is
of so vast and yet refined a character that it would be
wholly impossible , within the limits of this work , even
to
trace to
its
source
each
leading
principle ,
much
less
follow the
course
of decisions in all
the
various
ramifications
into which those principles
spread , we must
be
content , abandoning
the historical
method , with an
endeavour to exhibit
a general
outline
of the
present
jurisdiction of the
court, and the nature
of the relief
granted ; and we shall
afterwards
give
a short
account
of the mode in which , by suit
and
other
proceeding ,
that jurisdiction is exercised

Such an attempt
has
often been made,

success .
Thus it has been said (b) that it is the business of a
court of equity
in England to abate the rigour of the
common law ;
and, undoubtedly , there have been cases
where equitable interference has had this
effect ; but all
the rules of common law which equity has so taken upon
itself to overrule
have long
since been well
defined , and
many of them
have
ceased ,
even
at common
law ,
to
govern the judgments of the court (c).
In illustration of
this , and as an instance of a change in rules of law, due
to the establishment of equitable doctrines , we may men-
tion what has taken place as to penal bonds .
Bonds ap-
pear to have originally been
invented to evade the absurd
law prohibiting the taking of interest for money lent.
Equitable
If a debtor failed
to repay the principal
money and inte-
penalties
rest, since judgment
could not be given for interest , the
penalty might, with some show of justice , be demanded
specifically .
And courts of law held this .
Unfortunately
,
they continued
to act upon this view after the payment of
interest became
legal ; and even after the statute 37 Hen.
8, c. 9 , had declared the debt to be the "just and true
intent" of the parties to the contract , they
refused to
consider the payment of principal
, interest , and
costs , as
a full
satisfaction
of the
bond .
Now, it
is clear that
the object of parties in an ordinary
case of a bond is not
to provide
the penalty
as a compensation for default , but
to
secure
that
default
should
not be made.

(c) In addition
to the
case men-
tioned in a former
note and in the
text,
we
may
add
those
ancient
and now obsolete rules referred to by
Lord Campbell , as instances of "ab-
surdities
of common
law judges ,"
viz., that no action
could
be main-
tained , or a claim
founded , upon
a
deed detained in the
hands
of an-
other ; and that if a deed of grant
were lost ,
the thing

was
lost with it ; that a man was liable

fore, after
default in the strict
performance of the duty
contracted
for , and in
respect of which the
penalty
is
imposed , the defaulter
can substantially
place the other
party in as good a position
as if no default had occurred ,
which may often happen , it is unfair
and harsh to enforce
the penalty .
Accordingly
, equity interfered in aid of the
obligor (d).
Similar remarks
apply to the forfeiture
of
mortgaged
lands , because
the only object of a mortgage
is
a
security
for the
repayment
of money with inte-
rest , and therefore
a forfeiture
of the lands
ought
not
actually to take place until it is proved , in the most defi-
nite
manner , that the money cannot
be repaid .
These
equitable
principles , after long
being
acted upon in the
Court of Chancery , were, like several others (e) ,
at last
forced upon courts of law by the legislature ().
generalfol-
rules
The educational
course which thus , it seems , courts of
equity have furnished
to courts of law has been long
so
far completed that no new doctrines
in equity
opposed
to the
rules
or
doctrines
of courts
of law have
been
established .

For
instance , it never was the
business of the court of equity
to relax the law which formerly
existed in
this country
that
lands
descended
to the heir free from any liability
to the simple
contract
creditors
of the
ancestor ; or the
rule that a father
or other ancestor should never
succeed
to the lands of his son ; or , again , the rule by which
a
half-brother
was
postponed in the inheritance of land
to
a remote relation
of the whole blood .

EQUITABLE
JURISDICTION
OF THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
It, in some
instances,
disregarded
legislature
; but until the
interference of that authority
they were the law of the land, and , as such , observed
as
well by courts of equity as other courts , " hoc quidem per
quam durum est, sed ita lex scripta est ” (g).
The law of primogeniture , as it obtains in this country ,
is not looked upon with favour in other countries , and in
the opinion of many is not well founded in justice , yet no
one would think for a moment of urging any argument
as
to its injustice in a court of equity .
In such cases equity
not only does not pretend
to override law, but expressly
and professedly follows the law.
Nevertheless , even this
has

be
stated entirely without
qualification
.
There

have been
a
few
cases
where
,
if
equity has
not
abso-
lutely
put
an
end
to
positive law
,
it
has
shot not much
short of that
mark
.
The
most
remarkable
of these
is
the manner
in
which courts
of
equity have dealt with the
Statute of Frauds
.
This was an enactment
of
the greatest
benefit
to
society
,
yet
it
left
a
wide door open
to
the very
vice of fraud which
it
was intended
to
exclude
,
an instance
of
the
extreme difficulty
attending
all human
arrange-
ments
.
This door equity has boldly shut by disregarding
the statute
.
The statute says that no action

Yet
it
is

to

case
,
if

means which courts of equity have sanctioned , of charging
lands by a simple
deposit of deeds
relating
to them , is as
near to a repeal of the statute as can well be imagined ( ¿) .
Another instance where equity has made some not incon-
siderable
inroad
upon
a rule
of positive law occurs in
reference to the
Registration
Acts (k).
These
statutes Registration
require
that all incumbrances
upon lands in the counties
to which they
relate
shall , in order
to be supported
as
against
subsequent dealings , be registered .
Equity has,
however , modified this rule , to the extent of determining
that where the person
dealing
subsequently has notice of
the prior incumbrance , he shall give effect to it, whether
registered or not (1) .
It is certainly
a most righteous
principle
( m ) , that a
person who has notice of the just claim of another
shall
not avail himself of any formal defect in the title of that
other
so
as to oust his rights , yet , in the cases
to which
we now refer, to uphold this principle

to expend money upon it, and then ejects him ; and that
he then brings an action for mesne profits , here common
law could
not allow a set-off in the action of the money
expended, yet the action
would
be unjust without
such
allowance ; a court of equity would , in such a case , inter-
fere (n).
In the
case of accounts between partners , a court of
common law will not entertain an action by a man against
his partner ; to supply this omission , then , is the province
of a court
of equity .
Similar
cases
arise between
co-
Complicated executors , and
corporators .
Again ,
actions
of general
account are quite
admissible , yet the form of an action is
very
inconvenient
for the
investigation
of
complicated
accounts ; although , therefore , a court
of
equity is not
the proper
tribunal
for
a mere money demand , yet , from
its power to investigate
intricate
facts , it has long
exer-
cised jurisdiction in
cases
of complicated
accounts (o) ;
and where there
is any
relation
of confidence
existing
between the parties , such , for instance , as that of principal
and agent , the case seems still more naturally
to fall within
the jurisdiction ; but unless the accounts are mutual , and
not consisting of payments and receipts on one side only ,
or at least very complicated , or the confidential relation
is
clear, the court will refuse to entertain the case (p) .

ITS
RELATION TO LAW.

•
the spirit .
rules of interpretation
of laws or instruments
adopted by cording to
it, is that it determines according to the spirit of the rule ,
and not the strictness of the letter (q ) ; and no doubt this
is a favourite
maxim of the court , but it by no means is
a canon of interpretation
belonging
peculiarly
to this
court .
There
is not
a single
rule
of interpreting
laws
which is not equally used by all judges , as well those of
courts of law as of courts
of equity .
The law on this
subject was laid down , long ago, as follows (r) :-" From
which
cases it appears
that
the
sages of the law hereto-
fore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in
some
appearance
, and those statutes which
comprehend
all things in the letter they have expounded to extend but
to some things, and those which generally prohibit all people
from
doing
such an act they have interpreted
to permit
some people to do it , and those which
comprehend every
person in the letter they have adjudged to reach to some
persons only , which expositions have always been founded
upon the intent of the legislature , which
they have col-
lected
sometimes by considering the
cause
and necessity
of making
the
aet , sometimes by comparing one part of
the act with another , and sometimes by foreign
circum-
stances , so that they have ever been guided by the intent
of the legislature , which they have always taken according
to the necessity of the matter , and according to that which
is consonant to reason
and good discretion ."
The construction of an act of parliament , therefore , is
the same in all courts ; or if they differ , it is only as one
judge
may differ from
another judge
in the same court ,
a difference which ,
from
the
difficulty
which
exists in
framing statutes , so
as to be free from ambiguity , un-
happily
not unfrequently
occurs .
It comes
oftener within
the province of a court of equity , acting
as it does in the
administration
of property , to give constructions
to execu-
tory instruments
, such as wills , agreements for settlement ,

and the like ; and in doing this , judicial liberality in the
interpretation
of language is often very largely called into
play , but no rule of interpretation
peculiar to the court is
ever contended for (s).
For instance , suppose
a deed of
settlement purporting
to be made in pursuance of articles
does
not carry into effect
what
a court of equity would
construe
as the
intention
of the
articles , a court of law
adheres
to the construction
of the
deed , and disregards
the articles (t) ; and
so also would
a court of equity , so
long
as no proceedings
have been taken
to reform the
settlement
(u) , even though the case was such that a court
of equity
would , probably , in a suit
instituted
for the
purpose, reform the settlement (x).
It has also been said (y) that FRAUD , ACCIDENT , and
frand, acci- TRUST, are the proper and peculiar
objects of a court of
trust
are
pe-
equity
.
This
,
again
,
is
an
inaccurate view
to
give

the
subject
,
because
,
although
under
these three heads fall
a
very large
number
of
the
cases which
require the inter-
ference
of
a
court
of
equity
,
yet they fail
in
being
a

of classification

of

cases

execution of
refused to produce it , and consequently it was necessary
to resort to equity to obtain
a relaxation
of such rules .
But since courts of law have
so far modified their
rules
as to make due provision for these difficulties , it has resulted
that
accident rarely now forms
a satisfactory
reason for
equitable interference : and in most cases , where the juris-
diction
is allowed
to
exist
at all, it is merely
because ,
having
been once
acquired , it cannot be afterwards
lost
or
abandoned .
Of those few
cases
which , resting
upon
the
ground
of
accident ,
are
such
that
relief
can
still
only be obtained in a court of equity , we may mention , as
an example , that of a defective execution of a power . If Defective
a man , having a power to appoint a fund , and intending
a power.
to execute it, does
so by will, when , perhaps , the power
requires a deed , or where some other formalities
in execut-
ing the power , not of the
essence
of the act, have not
been observed, these
are accidental
circumstances
which
render the execution of the power bad at law ; yet equity
has always , if there was some good moral reason
for sup-
porting the execution of the power, such as to provide for
payment of
debts ,
or the support
of wife
or
children ,
been ready to interfere and establish the execution of the
power ( ).
It may here be noticed that equity has never
ventured
to correct
a defective execution
of a will , the
mode of executing
that particular
instrument
being one
to which the legislature
has paid especial attention
; and
though , through
the accidental ignorance of an intending
testator , he may fail to carry out his intention , this is an
irremediable
accident , and rightly
so , for reasons
suffi-
ciently obvious .
As to trusts , the
relation
of trustee
and beneficiary , Trusts .
or cestui
que trust , is, when a trust technically
so called.
exists , no doubt
peculiarly
within the jurisdiction of a
court
of equity , but there
are many
cases
substantially
of trust which
are cognizable
in courts of law ; for in-

stance, deposits and all manner of bailments , and espe-
cially that implied
contract , so highly beneficial and use-
ful , of having
undertaken
to account for money received
to another's use, which is the ground of an action on the
case almost
as universally
remedial
as
a bill in
equity .
And there are
cases where courts of law take notice even
of trusts , commonly
so
called ; for instance ,
a court of
law allows
an executor or administrator
to retain
for a
debt owing to a trustee under a trust of which the execu-
tor or administrator
is the cestui que trust (a) .
All these
descriptions of equity , then , as distinguished
definitions
from law , in our system of administration
of justice , are,
as we
see , inaccurate and incomplete
; and yet , to no in-
considerable
extent , they assist the mind in comprehend-
ing what
portion
of the whole
area
of justice
is taken
possession of by the Court of Chancery .
For equity does ,
in each
department of natural justice
indicated
by these
descriptions , go farther , and take a wider and less restricted
view than courts of law do , and so it is able to approach
somewhat
nearer to that complete and perfect result , the
attainment of which
is scarcely to be hoped by the most
sanguine .
Fraud in
In a court
of equity ,
many
actions , not
criminal
in
themselves , nor
even done
with a wrong
intention ,
are
moral fraud . Scrutinised , and often disapproved of and set aside, when
the eye of
this court
may exist
without
to impugn
them
in a court of law would
be impossible .
There have been
cases , indeed , in which
equity has been
thought to have gone too far in attempting
to enforce a
scrupulous
adherence to
conscientious
dealing , and the
rules of the court have consequently been
relaxed in this
respect (b) .

tient (h) : it may be added , that if the benefit be conferred
upon third parties who have taken
no part in the trans-
action , and
are
therefore innocent of all fraud , still they
will not be allowed to retain
that which comes
through
a polluted channel (i).
Notwithstanding
the willingness of the court to exercise
this control
over the consciences of men , great caution
is
observed not to encroach
upon
the functions
properly
exerciseable by other courts ; and a remarkable
case of the
refusal of the Court
of Chancery
to
interfere
is that of
Allen v. M'Pherson (k) , where the House of Lords , sitting
as a court of appeal from the
Court
of Chancery , held
that the court would
not after probate
set
aside
a will
obtained fraudulently
and by undue influence .
From what
we have shown , it will be
observed that
equity does in no inconsiderable
measure fulfil the popular
notion entertained of it, that it aims at complete justice
irrespective
of any legal
quibble
or technical
difficulty .
Still , it must carefully be borne in mind , that the court is
slow
at the
present
day to
convert
any moral
doctrine
which has not already been made a ground
of equitable
jurisdiction , into a principle
of equity .
We pass
on now
to another
and wholly distinct
ground
which
has
been
occupied by the court , and where it has
brought within
the range of its influence a large field of jurisdiction
.
The court from
the earliest times

a remedy compared with the
effectual relief which the other court gives by prohibiting
the trade on pain

This positive kind

cases ; it will
even be granted

the

of damages
in

breach (0).
If
The two kinds of justice which may be obtained , the
one strictly remedial , the other
preventive
in respect of
the violation of continuing
rights , are clearly different in
kind ;-one is legal , the other equitable

the two courts will usurp the functions of the other.

although
the
court
now (1) can in many such
cases
award damages in addi-
tion to or even , according to its discretion , in substitution
for the injunction
; yet it will refuse to interfere altogether

EQUITABLE RELIEF .

though
able now under
certain
circumstances
to issue
a
writ of injunction
, will not entertain any application when
no breach has been committed .
Another
branch
of the same kind of positive relief is
the
power which
the
court exercises of compelling
the
specific
performance
of agreements.
A
man
may be
indirectly
compelled
to
carry
out
his
contract
by the
fear of being mulcted
in damages by a court of law , in
the event of his failing to do
so ; but
another , and often
a desirable mode , is to insist upon his performing
the
duty which he owes under the contract by putting him in
prison till he does so ;
or , as may happen in some
cases ,
to do it for him, of course at his cost .
The latter are the
courses which
the Court of Chancery
adopts . If a man
agrees to sell land, he will be
at the
proper
stage of
a suit
in equity , instituted
for
the purpose , ordered to
execute a conveyance
, and if he disobeys he will
be im-
prisoned for contempt : or the court will
make an order
vesting
the land
having
the
same
effect
as if he had
executed it (s) .
By virtue
then of the
peculiar
reliefs
which
this court
is able to give , and which
other courts
cannot give , the
specific performance of contracts forms
an important
branch
of equitable jurisdiction.
But it is
not
every
contract
that
will
draw
with it an
equity
to compel
its fulfilment.
Some contracts are obviously
entered into solely for the purpose of making a profit ; of
this kind are the ordinary
commercial
contracts for the
purchase
or sale of goods such as are constantly
in the
market
in the case of these contracts , if they be broken ,
damages are all that are or can
be required ; with these ,
therefore , equity has nothing
to do .
Other contracts
are
of a peculiar nature , involving
personal
conduct or some
similar ingredient , such as to sing at a theatre (t) , or write

It is considered to be beyond the power of any court to
secure the due performance of such acts by any amount of
compulsion (z ) , and
so equity will
not
decree
their per-
formance ;
nevertheless , in
many
of
even
these
cases ,
equity will , indirectly , do much towards
securing
the due
completion of the agreement ; for if the
contract
contain
a negative
clause correlative
to the positive
agreement ,
such as not to sing at any other theatre , or not to write
plays
for
any
other
theatre ,
equity
will
interfere
by
restraining
a violation
of the
negative clause (a) .
This
interference will
be granted , however , only
on
condition
that the plaintiff who seeks
the aid of the court
is
not
himself under any obligation
to do any acts of that nature
which
the
court
cannot
specifically
enforce .
This
is
an
obviously reasonable condition , for it would be contrary to
all the practice of the court to give equitable relief to one
over whom the court has not
complete control
in respect
of his correlative duties (b) .

we have mentioned for the sale or purchase of an interest
in land , and also of many kinds of personal property , such
as shares in a company (d) , are instances which
are daily
before the court .
We will only add that where the main
provisions of the contract have been of a description such
as the court commonly deals with, but some minor acces-
sory term is of a personal nature , the court has in a few
instances
ordered specific
performance of that which can
be so decreed , and directed a covenant to be entered
into
for the rest (e).
There are many other instances of this kind of relief
by which
the
court
substantially
enforces
the
due
ob-
servance of rights , by restraining
the commission of acts
in violation
of them , besides
cases

action at
law on
equitable
grounds.
Restraint of
We have already adverted to the power which the court
has
assumed of
preventing
persons from proceeding
at
law contrary to equity and good conscience : this is done
by injunction .
The court has always declined laying down
precise rules as to the limits within which it will keep in
exercising the power
of granting injunctions , but
such
limits
may now usually
be
determined
with
sufficient
accuracy by reference to precedents , a very vast number
of which
are contained in the reports ().
Another species of suit , the reason for which very much
arises from the power of giving peculiar
relief possessed
by the court
is , where the
court , at the
instance
of the
plaintiff, sets aside a completed transaction . If there be
good grounds
for treating
a conveyance of property
or
other deed
or instrument
as an improper
transaction , and
for setting it aside, a court of equity alone has the power
to accomplish that result in a direct manner .
A court of
law is either
powerless to deal with the case at all , or at
the most possesses
inadequate
powers .
The grounds for
setting
aside a completed
transaction , which
usually are
some species
of fraud , may be pleaded in a court of law ;
but a plea can only arise as a defence
to an action of some
kind , and no procedure at law is applicable for commencing
proceedings to avoid the effect of a deed upon the ground
of fraud .
But a bill may be filed praying
that a deed of
conveyance or other instrument
obtained in some improper
manner may be set aside, and the rights of parties restored
to the state in which they would have been had such deed
or other instrument
never been
executed (k) .

pleader.
Until
recently ,
there was
a
numerous
class
of
suits Inter-
called
interpleader
suits , or suits for relief from
adverse
claims .
Where
a man in the possession of certain goods
or money not his own finds himself exposed
to the adverse
claims of several persons, it often happens that he cannot
safely take
a discharge from any of them ,
since it is
doubtful
which of them is properly entitled
to claim .
In
such
cases the court gives relief by requiring
the several
claimants , when brought
before it in a suit instituted
for
the purpose , to interplead , that is , bring their claims to an
issue , so
as to be decided upon .
Formerly, this
remedy
in equity was alone available
for the purpose , but
since
similar remedies have been given
to courts of law ( ),
interpleader
suits are less common , being usually confined
to cases where the claims are of an equitable nature .
We have seen (m) that the Court of Chancery had , as Partition .

its
common law jurisdiction

of
a
writ
of partition

certain cases
;
and
in
other cases
the old
writ
of
partition
issued out
of
chancery
,
but was return-
able

OF CHANCERY .
Bills of
peace.
The
method
of
procedure
adopted by the
Court
of
Chancery is by issue of a commission to make the parti-
tion
and adjust the rights of the parties by giving com-
pensation ,
or owelty ,
as it is called , where the divided
portions
of the land
cannot be accurately made propor-
tionate to the
shares
of the
several owners ; liberty is ,
however , usually given to the parties themselves to make
proposals for the partition , and the court gives
its
consi-
deration
to
these
.
Recently
,
the benefit
of
this action on
the part
of
the
court
has been extended by giving the
court power
to
direct
a
sale
of
the property
in
certain
cases instead
of
a
partition
,
which
obviously would often
be
very advantageous
,
but previously
could
not
be
done
without the consent
of
all concerned
,
a
thing often

infancy
or
other disabilities

be

In some cases
,
in
which
a
perfect and appropriate remedy
exists
at
law
,
but the circumstances
are such
as
to
give
rise
to
innumerable
actions
at
law
,
founded upon the same
general private right
,
each
of
which actions must be sepa-
rately tried and disposed
of
,
whether such right
is
a
right
claimed
in
favour
or
against
a
number
of
persons
,
equity
will interfere
,
in
order
to
avoid multiplicity
of
suits
,
or
to
prevent oppressive litigation
.
Thus
,
where the amount
of
a
general fine
,
payable by all the copyhold
tenants
of
a
manor
,
is
in
dispute
(o),
or
where the rights
of
common
to
which the tenants are
entitled
are not ascertained
(p),
equity will entertain
a
suit
on
behalf
of
all the copyhold
tenants
.
Another
instance of such interference
is
where
the court will restrain
a
man from continuing
to
invade
a
legal right by
a
series
of
separate
acts
,
each of which
gives rise
to
an action
,
but the damages
in
each
case
are
trivial
;
thus
equity will
restrain
the infringement
of
an
ancient
ferry

, we may mention
a recent case where the reservoir of a waterworks company
burst , thereby causing
damage to a very large number of
people ; a large
number
of claims
was made against the
company , all founded upon similar grounds . The company
instituted
a suit against some of them , for the purpose of
determining ,
once
for all, a question which
had
arisen ,
upon which turned the validity of the claims .
The court

the bill as of the nature of a bill of peace ,

mention , is the
perpetuation
of testimony .
Courts of
common
law only permit the
examination
of witnesses
when an action is at issue, and the evidence must be con-
fined to the issue in such action .
It sometimes happens
that
there is
a reasonable
certainty
of litigation
at
a
future
time , yet , from
the
circumstances
of the
case ,
the right to be claimed
or defended in
such
litigation
cannot , or does not , form the subject of present proceed-
ings .
To
take
a single
instance ,
a person
may be in
possession of an
estate
under
a title
depending
upon a
marriage , the validity of which he may have reasonable
cause
to fear will
be disputed , and to support which , if
litigation should ensue , the evidence of certain witnesses
would be necessary.
Now, clearly he, being in possession
,
can take no proceedings
against
a possible
claimant who
does not come forward
; if, therefore , he had no means of
preserving
the evidence in question , there might result
a
failure
of justice ,
because
the
other
might
await
the
deaths of the witnesses , and then press his claim .
It is
easy to suggest numerous similar instances .
For all these
the Court of Chancery has provided a remedy by allowing
a bill to be filed to perpetuate the testimony (s).

theless , it takes every care that
this right shall
not be
abused,
as it is
obviously
not unattended
with danger ,
because
witnesses , whose evidence is not to be published
until a period which may be subsequent to their decease (t) ,
are, under
some
temptation , to give
interested
evidence.
If, therefore , by any means the issue can be tried at once ,
such
a suit will not be allowed (u).
When the evidence
has been taken , it is sealed
up until the time comes to use
it, and the suit is at an end, for , of course , it never comes
to a hearing , and the plaintiff pays the costs .
A modern act (v ) has extended the benefit of this pro-
ceeding to a case
not previously
admitted
by the
court ,
viz . , where a person
would , under the circumstances which
he alleges to exist , become
entitled , upon the happening of
some future event, to any honour , title , dignity , or office ,
or any estate or interest in any property , the title to which
cannot be brought
to trial before the happening
of the
event in question . It enables
him to file a bill in chancery
to perpetuate any testimony
which
may be material
to
support
his
claim .
In
any such
suit , if the
crown
is
interested , the attorney -general is to be made
a party in
respect of such interest , and in any proceedings in which
the
evidence
taken in the suit is used, no objection
shall
be taken that the crown was not a party to the suit.
We have hitherto
been exhibiting
that part of the juris-
diction
of the
court
which ,
having
for its origin the
ancient
assumptions
of power
on the part of the early
chancellors , although
modified
or enlarged by subsequent
legislation , may be described
as its inherent jurisdiction ,
depending
as
we
see partly
upon

are made under the
direction
of the
court (y).
Other

By the same act, the court has
power to rectify the register of members , if the name of
any person is without sufficient cause entered in or omitted
from the register (z) .
Also under the later
act of 1867
(30 & 31 Vict . c . 131 ) , the court has other
duties to per-

to
schemes
for
reducing
the
capital

To these we need not refer in detail .
Somewhat analogous to the duties of the court relative
to companies generally , are
some special provisions
made
by the legislature
for railway companies .
Under
certain
circumstances , schemes
for the arrangement of the affairs
of these companies , when they are in financial difficulties ,
may be proposed to the court (a).
Another most important
power
conferred by the legis-
lature upon the court , is that which it exercises
in favour
of creditors , for the purpose of enabling
them to obtain

This , in the case of a deceased
debtor , was given by the
act 3 & 4 Will . 4 , c. 104.
In the case of a living debtor ,
there were no means of applying
the lands themselves to
the purpose of paying
debts by a sale of them until the
year 1838 , when
the act
1 & 2 Vict . c . 110 , was passed,
and then , and
for
a long period afterwards , the process
remained tedious and costly ; but now a creditor who has
obtained
judgment
,
and
taken
the
lands
in execution
under a writ of elegit , may obtain an order for their
sale
in a simple and speedy manner by petition to the court (b) .
Upon hearing the petition , the court directs
inquiries
to
be made as to the debtor's
interest in the land and his
title thereto , and
as far
as possible
conducts the sale in
the same way as in the other
case , where the
lands of a
deceased
person are sold for the payment of his debts ( c) .
Infancy .
Inasmuch
as cases of trust and those relating to infancy Trusts and
are naturally the
subjects of the
care of the Court of
Chancery , any improvements of the law, or facilities
for
the satisfaction
of the wants of society which the legis-
lature
might
devise, would
of course take
effect
by the
agency of the
Court
of Chancery ;
accordingly
we find
that several acts have been passed for the purpose of meet-
ing the specific wants of trustees and
infants .
By the
Trustee Relief Act ( 12 & 13 Vict . c. 74 ) , trustees may in
suitable cases discharge themselves from all responsibility
by paying the trust
moneys into
the Court of Chancery ,
after which , the court
takes upon itself the custody and
distribution
of the funds
exactly
as if a suit had
been
regularly
commenced
for the purpose (d).
It
may be
noticed that this act does
not , perhaps , extend the juris-
diction
of the court , so much
as
provide
peculiar
and
abnormal

Trustee Act , 1850
(13 & 14 Vict . c. 60) , provides
for the
appointment of new trustees of a settlement or will , in a
summary and expeditious
way , without
instituting a suit
for the general
administration
of the trust
and a later
act (22 & 23 Vict . c. 35 , s . 30 ) allows
trustees to ask for
and obtain the advice of the court
upon matters relating
to their trust, without the formalities
of a suit .
But the legislature
has
done more than provide short
and inexpensive
modes of obtaining the benefits of the
court's guidance in those matters
relating to administra-
tion of property , for it has
in
several
instances
given
power to the court to do more than it formerly could ; it
can now actually
change the legal right to land or estate ,
if a trustee refuse to act, or be unknown , or not to be
found (e).
Closely
connected
with these statutory provisions facili-
tating the discharge of their
duties by trustees , are those
which
relate to the custody and management
of infants
and their
property .
Infants
are ,
as
we
have
before
shown (f), peculiarly
the
care of the court of chancery ,
representing
the
sovereign in his
character
of parens
patrice .
The benefit
derived from this care has not been
without its share of legislative
attention , and accordingly
special and enlarged powers have been given to the court .
By the
Custody of Infants ' Act
(2 & 3 Vict . c. 54) , a
mother of an infant who is in the
sole custody or control
of the father
or his
agent , or of any guardian
after the
father's death , may obtain an order from the court allow-
ing her access to the infant at reasonable times ; or, if the
infant be within the age of seven years , the court may
order the
delivery
of the infant into her
custody until
attaining that age .
Again , under an act passed
in the year 1855
(18 & 19
Vict. c. 43 , commonly called the Infants ' Settlement Act) ,
the court
may give
its
sanction
to
a settlement

of mar-

a settlement made with this

In the following
year
,
1856
,
another act was passed
(

&
20 Vict
.
c.
120
),
which
enables the court
to
authorise
leases
or
sales
of
any settled
estates
(
),
which the court
may
in
its discretion deem proper
to
be carried out
.
This
act extended the
powers which
had
been
conferred by
the legislature
upon the court
,
about twenty
-
six
years
previously
(
by
1

the
court
to
authorise
leases
to
be granted
of
lands
of
which
an
infant might be seised

or

of
these acts was

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF THE
COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
The legislature
has ever been anxious to promote the
improvement
of property , and
has
passed several
acts
with that object ; to these we only refer here in order to
remark , that whenever the consent
or act of an owner of
land , or of some
interest
in land , is necessary
, and could
not by reason of his
infancy
or
incapacity
be otherwise
obtained , the court of chancery is empowered , in a proper
case , to authorise the act , or give the consent on behalf of
such infant or incapacitated
person .
The authority or con-
sent is obtained upon a simple application
by petition ().
So where land in settlement , or belonging
to persons
under some incapacity to deal with their interest , is com-
pulsorily taken
for , or injuriously
affected
by , some work
of public
importance , such as a railway, canal , or public
building (m) , the special authority
to take or injure which
is, of course , derived from the legislature , it is always en-
trusted
to the court of chancery to see that
the
money
paid
as
purchase -money or by way of compensation , is
applied in accordance with the rights
of parties
to the
land taken or affected (n).

or
will creating the
trust , if prepared
by a skilled
draftsman
having
such
a knowledge
of the
nature
of the
property
as might lead him to an-
ticipate
its probable
requirements .
This knowledge , however , is rarely
possessed.
The
writer
was
ac-
quainted with an
eminent
convey-
ancer
who , in
preparing
his
own
will, purposely
abstained
from
in-
serting
a
power
to
grant
mining
leases, because he thought
it was
well ascertained
that
there were no
minerals
under
his
land .
Yet not
three months
elapsed after his death
before a coal master offered to take
a lease of some coal under the land ;
and the trustees were
compelled
to
go to the court
for power to grant
it.
In connection with this remedy
by act of parliament
for
imperfect
conveyancing , we may here call at-
tention to the
act 23 & 24 Vict . c.
145.

some more effectual or less costly remedy than previously
existed .
The details of these enactments would be out of

have been con-

upon
the court of chancery
which we need notice , is the
control which , by the Attor-

court
exercises

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION

OF CHANCERY .
Idiots and

Solicitors have always been, and are , considered as officers
of the court , and therefore have always been subject to its
authority in matters
relating
to their
professional
duty ;
but
by the
act just
mentioned , peculiar
facilities
are
given both to the client , for the purpose of ascertaining
that he has been fairly dealt with by his professional adviser ,
and to the solicitor for obtaining
payment of his costs .
We have thus
illustrated , so far
as our limits
would
allow , the subject of this chapter ; but there remains
one
subject
which ,
though
not
strictly
a
part
of equitable
jurisdiction
, is
so closely allied
to it , that it may , with
advantage , find
its place at the
close
of a description of
the power of the court .
In the same category , of those who , like infants , require
a quasi parental care , are persons who , being either idiots (9)
jurisdiction
or of unsound mind , are unable to take care of themselves
of chancery. or their property .
We have already
remarked
that the
of the court
sovereign , to whose care these fall , entrusts
the charge to
the chancellor .
But the care
of idiots and lunatics
does
not form part of the general jurisdiction of the court of
chancery .
The
master of the rolls
and the vice -chan-
cellors have no jurisdiction whatever to interfere with the
affairs of a lunatic , which would
not be the case if such
interference
were considered to be part of the
inherent
jurisdiction of the court , because in that case all applica-
tions would be heard in the first instance by one of them .
It is convenient , however , in this place , to mention
the

it

at
last provided by common consent
,
that
it
should

his
people
;
in
order
to
prevent
the idiot
from
wasting
his
estate
;
and reducing himself and his heirs
to
poverty and
distress
(y

This fiscal prerogative
of
the king
is
declared
in

by statute
17
Edw
.

which
directs
(
in
affirmance

that the king shall
have ward

,
taking the profits
without waste
or
destruction
,
and shall find
them neces-
saries
;
and after the death of such idiots he shall render
the
estate
to
the heirs
in
order
to
prevent
such idiots
from
aliening
their
lands
,
and
their
heirs
from
being
disinherited
.
By the old common law there was
a
writ
de
idiota in-
quirendo
,
to
inquire whether
a
man
be
an idiot
or
not
(a):
which must
be
tried by
a
jury
of
twelve men
:
and
,
if
they
find him purus idiota
,
the profits
of
his
lands
and the
custody
of
his person may be granted by the king
to
some
subject
,
who has interest
enough
to
obtain
them
.
This
appropriation

was

as

EQUITABLE JURISDICTION
OF THE COURT
OF
CHANCERY .
and as early as in the 8 Jac.
1 , it was under the conside-
ration of parliament , to vest this custody in the relations
of the party , and to settle an equivalent on the crown in
lieu of it ; it being then proposed that this and the slavery
of the feudal
tenures , which
has since
been
abolished ,
should share the same fate (b) .
Yet few instances can be
given of the oppressive exertion of it , since it seldom hap-
pened that a jury found
a man
an idiot
a nativitate but
only non compos
mentis from some particular
time ; which
formerly had an operation very different in point of law.
A man
is not an idiot
(c) , if he has any glimmering
of reason, so that
he can tell his parents , his age , or the
like
common
matters .
But
a man
who is born
deaf,
dumb , and blind , is looked
upon by the law in the same
state with an idiot (d) ; he being
supposed incapable of
any understanding , as wanting
all
those
senses
which
furnish the human mind with
ideas (e) .
A lunatic , or non compos
mentis , is one who has had
understanding
, but by disease , grief,
or other
accident ,
has lost the
use
of his
reason (f) .
A lunatic
is indeed
properly
one that
has
had
lucid intervals :
sometimes
enjoying
his
senses , and
sometimes
not , and
that fre-
quently depending
upon the changes of the moon .
But
under
the general
name of non
compos mentis
(which
sir
Edward Coke
says
is the most
legal
name)
are
com-
prised
not only
lunatics , but persons under frenzies , or
who lose their intellects by disease ; those that grow deaf,
dumb , and blind , not being
born
so ; or such , in short , as

it was held that one who

not
having

so,
was to be deemed non compos men-
tis.
The
presumption
that
a per-
son deaf, dumb , and blind
from
his

presumption , and is therefore
open
to
be
rebutted
by evidence
of ca-
pacity .

are proved to be incapable of conducting their own affairs .
To these also , as well
as idiots , the king has always been
guardian , but to a very different
purpose .
For
the law
always imagined that these
accidental
misfortunes
might
be removed ; and therefore only constituted
the crown a
trustee for the unfortunate
persons , to protect
their pro-
perty , and to account to them for all profits received , if
they recover, or after their decease
to their representatives .
And therefore it was declared by the statute
17 Edw. 2 , c.
10, that the king should provide for the custody and sus-
tentation
of lunatics ,
and
preserve their lands
and the
profits
of them
for their
use , when
they
came to their
right mind ; and the king should take nothing
to his own
use ; and if the parties
died in
such
estate , the residue
should
be distributed
for their souls by the advice of the
ordinary
of course now (by the subsequent amendments
of the law of administration ) the residue
goes
to their
executors or administrators
.
Formerly , also, there was a writ de lunatico inquirendo ,
upon which persons were ascertained to be lunatics , which
was tried much like the writ de idiota
inquirendo .
These
writs are now superseded by the modern methods which
have been
introduced
and
improved
as
experience
has
pointed out the most
convenient
and beneficial
measures
to be adopted.
At the
present
time the whole
care
of
lunatics
is regulated by acts of parliament
(g ) , both
as to
those who are so found , after solemn inquiry or inquisition
,
and those who , though of unsound mind , have not
been
so found by inquisition
, either by reason
of the expecta-
tion of their recovery entertained by their friends , or from
their not being possessed
of any property .

WE will endeavour , in this
chapter , to exhibit
to the
reader a general view of the
proceedings in a chancery
suit , so as to enable one who is not familiar with the course
of the court to understand the principal
events which take
place, their
effects , and relative
importance ; but it will
not be possible , within the limits to which
we are
con-
fined , to give much account of the numerous rules which
require to be observed

A SUIT IN
CHANCERY .
The bill.
consolidated and amended the former orders.
These enact-
ments and
orders , with
a
few
subsequent
acts
( c )
and
general orders and regulations , together with a vast col-
lection
of reported cases
decided upon points of practice ,
now constitute the law of the court .
It would
be tedious , and it is unnecessary for our pur-
pose , to give any historical
account of the various pro-
ceedings , when and how they
originated , and how they
gradually
assumed
their present form .
We shall, there-
fore , confine our description
to the practice
as
existing
at the present time .
A suit in chancery is commenced by filing in the office
of the clerk of records and writs in chancery a document
called a bill (d) .
This bill , a model of which is given in
the schedule of the consolidated orders above referred to,
is
a petition
addressed
to the lord chancellor in a parti-
cular form .
At the head of it appear the
names of the
parties to the suit , then follows
an address to the person
holding the great seal, the terms of which
are prescribed
by the court upon every change of the custody of the seal ,
or alteration in the
style
of the person to whom it is
committed .
The
description
and address of the plain-
tiff are then
stated.
After this is set forth a statement
of all the
facts
and
circumstances , and the purport , or
sometimes
even
the words of the documents , upon which
the plaintiff intends
to rely.
In this part
is introduced
any inference of law or fact which
the plaintiff thinks it
advisable to state, and there sometimes is added
that which
the plaintiff
conceives
will be the defence , together with
the matter which
he thinks sufficient
to avoid such de-
fence .
This stating part of the bill is succeeded
by the
prayer , in which the plaintiff

he thinks himself entitled to , always (e) concluding with a
prayer for general
relief.
The bill must be
signed
by
counsel (f) . It is printed , and a printed copy is filed (g) .
On it
there is an indorsement
equivalent
to a writ
or
command from
her
majesty to the defendant to cause an
appearance
to be entered in the court (h).
When the bill
has been filed , a copy of it is stamped by the
clerk of
records
and writs ,
which
is
served
on
the
defendant ;
and if there be more than
one defendant , such
a copy is
served
on each . If the defendant be out of the jurisdic-
tion , the court , upon application of the plaintiff, showing
where he probably may be found , will order service upon
him abroad, giving him a reasonable time to appear (i) .

does , to examine dant.
the defendant , and thus elicit information
in support of his
case , is to file (k) , and then serve interrogatories (), in which
Interroga-
the plaintiff puts to the defendant such questions relative
to the subject matter of the suit as he thinks proper (m) .
(e) Except when the bill is merely
to obtain
discovery , and not asking
for any relief , a bill which , now that
common law courts have the power
of interrogating
parties , is compara-
tively rare .

Answer.
When interrogatories
have been served, the defendant
is bound to answer them within twenty -eight days (n), on
pain of imprisonment
; but the
time will be readily
ex-
tended on application
to the court if a sufficient reason be
given .
The answer to the bill
is
the
statement of the
defendant made , on oath , in answer to the interrogatories
;
it usually
constitutes the commencement of the defence to
the suit
in it the defendant
is bound to reply fully to
every question in the interrogatories .
But besides these
replies , he may also state any facts which he thinks mate-
rial to his defence . If he have not been interrogated , he
may if he pleases , within
a limited time (o) , make a volun-
tary answer.
An answer , like a bill, being
an important
part of the pleadings , must
be signed by counsel ; it is ,
like a bill , printed
and filed .
An answer is not however
the only mode of defence .
If any ground of defence
is apparent on the bill itself ,
either
from the matter
contained
in it , or from
some
defect in its frame or in the case made by it, the defendant
may , instead of answering it , demur to it ; and this is then
Demurrer.
the proper mode of defence .
A demurrer
is an allegation
by a defendant which , admitting
for the purpose of argu-
ment the matters of fact alleged by the bill
to be true ,
shows that
as they are therein
set forth they are insuffi-
cient for the plaintiff to proceed upon ,
or to oblige the
defendant to answer (p).
The grounds
of demurrer
are
various ; the
commonest
is,
that
the
subject
of
the
suit is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity , or,
what is much the same thing, that there is not stated in
the bill such
a case
as entitles
the plaintiff to any dis-
covery or relief in a court of equity : other grounds
are ,
that the plaintiff is not entitled
to sue by reason of some
gatories
as
may
be
calculated
to
elicit the truth. It is not essential ,
however , to follow this course .

personal
disability , or want of interest
on his part ;
or ,
although
the plaintiff may have an interest in the subject-
matter , and may be under
no disability
, and may have a
good title to sue, yet that the defendant is not the proper
person to be sued
by the plaintiff, either from not having
any interest in the subject-matter of the suit , or from his
not owing any duty to the plaintiff.
Another
ground
of
demurrer is , that complete justice cannot be done without
other persons than
those made parties to the suit being
before the court (q) ; and that the bill is therefore defec-
tive
for want
of parties ,
and
ought
not to
proceed .
Another, and the last ground of demurrer which we need
here mention , is that of multifariousness
.
The court will
not permit a plaintiff to demand by one bill several mat-
ters of different natures against several defendants , or even ,
where the demands are clearly distinct
in their character ,
against
one
defendant .
A defendant
may ,
therefore ,
demur to a bill open to this objection (r) .
When a demurrer is put in to the bill , and the plaintiff
does not admit its validity, the case is set down for argu-
(q) The
demurrer
for
want
of
parties
was
formerly
a
fruitful
source of annoyance
and
expense .
This has been much
diminished
by
the alteration
made by the
legisla-
ture in the rules of the court (15 &
16 Vict . c. 86, s. 42 ; Cons . Order ,
vii . 1, 2).
The old
rule , requiring
the
presence
of every
person
who
was
materially
interested
in
the
subject -matter
of the suit,
arose
from
the
extreme
anxiety
of the
court
to do complete
justice , and
prevent
future
litigation .
The
strictness
with which it
was
ap-
plied
often
led
to great
practical
injustice ,
from
the
difficulty
and
expense of complying
with it. This
led
to
its
relaxation
in
several
classes of cases, mentioned
in the
act and the orders .
(r) For illustrations
of the seve-
ral kinds of demurrers , see Mitford
on Pleadings , ch . ii. s. 2, p . 1, and
also J. W. Smith's
Notes
thereto .
The demurrer for want
of equity is
the most
frequent , that
for multi-
fariousness
the next .
The skill of
draughtsmen , however , in prepar-
ing bills, renders demurrers not very
common ; sometimes , however , the
plan of filing a bill in order
that it
may be demurred
to, is adopted
as
a convenient
means of quickly ob-
taining the
opinion
of the
court
upon the construction
of an instru-
ment , upon which the plaintiff in
such a case founds
his
claim .
The
parties in such a case usually acqui-
esce in the decision
upon
the
de-
murrer .

Plea.
ment before the court .
If the court thinks the demurrer
is well founded , the decision is equivalent
to a dismissal
of the bill , and
so terminates
the suit as regards the de-
murring defendant .
Sometimes , however , the court , whilst
holding
the demurrer to be well founded , yet considers the
circumstances to be such that it ought not to put an end
to the suit , but give the plaintiff an opportunity of making
some alteration in the statement of his case .
The court
then allows
the demurrer , but gives leave
to the plaintiff
to amend his bill.
In such case the plaintiff usually has
to pay the
costs which
have been
incurred
by the defen-
dant up to that time .
to that time .
If the demurrer is , in the opinion
of the court , not well founded , it is overruled , and the suit
is in the
same
condition
as if it had not
been
put in ,
the defendant having , however , generally to pay the costs
occasioned by it.
A third method of defence
is by plea.
A plea is of the
nature of an answer to the bill , but is of a special kind ,
having no reference to any interrogatories which may have
been filed .
It may be described
as a statement of some
simple ground of defence , which
does
not appear on the
face of the bill , but which would if it were in the bill
render it
demurrable .
The grounds
of pleas are very
much like those of demurrers .
The object of them is to
save the expense of examination
of witnesses
at large ;
therefore it is not every good
defence
in equity
that is
good as a plea , for where the defence
consists of a variety
of circumstances , it is not proper for a plea , as the court
would be giving judgment on the case
before it is made
out by proof (s).
Pleas
are not much
favoured by the court , and except
where the fact pleaded is a bankruptcy
of the plaintiff or
defendant , taking away the right to sue or liability to be
sued , or some other equally simple
fact , they are rarely
resorted to, and still more rarely succeed .

If a plea succeeds , there is an end of the suit ; if it fails ,
the suit proceeds

to answer.
If the defendant , not succeeding in either demurrer or
plea , puts in an answer , the plaintiff next considers whether
the answer contains sufficient replies to his interrogatories .
If it does not , he excepts
to the sufficiency of the answer ; Exceptions
which is done by filing
a formal
statement of his objec-
tions , called the exceptions .
The exceptions , which must
show
accurately
wherein
the
answer
is
deficient ,
are
then argued before the court ; and if they
are
allowed ,
the
defendant
has
to put in
a further
answer.
This
process continues until the plaintiff has, in the
opinion
of the court , obtained
a
complete
answer to his
inter-
rogatories .
of bill.
A plaintiff, after seeing the answer , often finds that the Amendment
allegations contained in his bill are either incorrect
or in-
sufficient fully to exhibit
his
case
to the best advantage .
He is allowed
at that
stage , therefore , to amend his bill
by making
such alterations in it as he thinks proper , with
this
restriction
only , that he must
not by amendment
entirely alter the character of the suit .
He may also introduce
by amendment
any fact which
has
occurred
subsequently to the filing
of the
original
bill ( t) .
A bill may be amended
at other
stages
of the
suit besides after answer , and the changes which may be
introduced
by way of amendment are many and various ;
new parties may be added and
former
parties struck out ;
even a party originally plaintiff may be made a defendant ;
additional
relief may be
asked, and the former
prayer
altered .
Even at the hearing of a cause
in court amend-
ments are allowed ;
and the hearing will in
such
a case
be postponed for
a few days , in order that they may be
made (u).
An order is in every case
obtained from the

mental bill .

court giving leave to amend ; such an order will, before
the defendant has put in his answer , be given as of course
(i . e. without the defendant
being
allowed
to oppose it) ,
as
often
as the plaintiff pleases.
After
an answer
has
been put in, one
order to amend only will be granted as
of course, and any further order can only be obtained if
the
court , after hearing the defendant , thinks
proper to
allow it.
The plaintiff may file
interrogatories , and require
an
answer to his
amended bill if he pleases ; these new in-
terrogatories
are confined , however , to the subject -matter
of the
amendments , but the
same process for
insisting
upon
a sufficient
answer that
applied to the original bill
is repeated for the amended bill.
If the defendant wishes to examine the plaintiff in the
same searching manner in which he has himself been
ex-
amined , he may do so .
Formerly in order to do this , he was
obliged to file a second bill , i. e. institute a second suit,
called a cross
suit (x) , but now a defendant may , as
soon
as he has put in a sufficient answer (if required to answer) ,
file
interrogatories
for the
examination
of the plaintiff,
prefixing
to such interrogatories
a concise
statement of
the subjects on which discovery is sought .
The plaintiff
is bound to answer such interrogatories , in like manner as
the defendant was bound to answer the plaintiff's interro-
gatories .
When the defendant has answered in an unexception-
able manner , and the plaintiff no longer wishes to amend
his bill , the latter carefully considers the answer , and if he
finds that upon the answer alone , without
further
proof ,
there is sufficient ground for a final order or decree (which
rarely happens in hostile
suits ) , he is bound to
proceed

suit
is

necessary

In Hearing on
such a case the
cause is set
down

the answer being assumed in the argument to be true (z).
If, however , the plaintiff thinks ,
as usually
happens ,
that evidence beyond the
admissions
in the
answer is
necessary
to support his case , or if the defendant has not
been required to answer , and has not answered , then there
are two distinct courses open to the plaintiff, which differ
in their
effects
principally as to the mode in which
the
evidence is taken .
The plaintiff may at once put the cause
in issue , by filing what
is
called
a replication (a) , and is
equivalent to traversing
or denying
in toto the statements
in the answer.
Or he may serve
a notice of motion for a
decree (b).
These two modes of bringing the
cause
to a
hearing we will consider
separately , but before doing
so
it may be here
mentioned , that if he
has required
an
answer , but the defendant
has neglected to put one in ,
the plaintiff,
besides
taking
steps
to
imprison
him for
contempt
in not
answering , may file
a traversing

the parties at the hearing are printed
under the direction
of the record and writ clerks (e).
Sometimes , however ,
it is necessary, either
from the refusal
of a witness
to
make an affidavit , or for some
other reason , to compel a
witness
to give
evidence
;
when
this is the
case , the
examination
must of course be viva voce.
The witness is
served by the party who desires to examine him with a
writ of subpoena , to appear before one of the examiners of
the court , of whom there are two .
He is then examined ex
parte , no person
having
a right
to be present
at such
examination
except the party producing
the witness , his
counsel , solicitor , and agents .
The examination
is put
into writing by the examiner , and is then
treated
as an
affidavit (f).
All the evidence in chief must be taken in the above
modes , within eight weeks after issue is joined (g) , and
the cross -examination
of all witnesses is taken before the
court
at the hearing ( ), unless the witness
be, through
age, infirmity, or for some
other good reason satisfactory
to the court , incapable of being
so cross -examined (¿), or
unless the parties agree otherwise (k).
Besides
the
above
modes of
taking
evidence, it is
competent for any party , within fourteen days after issue
joined , to apply for an order that all the evidence, both
in chief and on
cross -examination , upon some particular
issue of fact , should
be taken viva voce at the hearing (1).

When an order of this kind has been made, the hearing ,
so far as concerns the issue of fact mentioned in the order ,
very much
resembles
a trial at nisi prius of a common
law action , the judge
taking
both the part of judge and
jury
a still
greater
resemblance ,
however, is allowed
under the recent improvements of chancery practice , inas-
much as the court may , if it thinks
fit
,
summon
a
jury
to
try before itself any question
of
fact which may arise
in
a
suit
.
This trial
by
jury
,
however
,
will not
,
unless by con-
sent of counsel on both
sides
,
be directed until the cause
has been actually brought
to
a
hearing
in
the usual way
(

and
it
is
completely
in
the discretion
of
the court whether
a

be
summoned
or
not

When the eight weeks allowed
for taking
evidence
in
the
manner
above
explained
have expired
,
or
when any
further
enlarged time which the court may have allowed
has expired
,
the evidence
(
except
as
to
such issue
,
if
any
,
as
is
to
be tried before the court
)
is
considered
to
be closed
,
and the cause
is
ripe for the hearing
.
The plaintiff ac-
cordingly
sets
it
down
in
the registrar's book
,
and
it
comes
on in its turn in court
.

the cause

the court has
,
whatever may

,
power
to
require the

any witness

is
wholly

Notice of
motion for
decree.
We come now to the course of preparing
evidence
in
the other case , viz . , where the plaintiff moves for a decree .
The notice of motion which he must give to the defendant
states
that one month from its date he will move the court
for
a decree (q) .
Before serving the notice of motion for
decree , the plaintiff must file all affidavits which he thinks
material for his purpose , and he must , at the foot of his
notice of motion which he serves upon the defendant , set
forth a list of the affidavits which he intends to use at the
hearing (r). It follows from this , that ifthe plaintiff wishes
to use the evidence of witnesses who refuse to make affi-
davits on his behalf , he must not proceed in this manner ,
but must file replication
; because , before giving the notice
of motion , he cannot
subpoena
any witnesses , and after
doing
so he is too late (s).
On the hearing of a motion
for decree , the answer , if there
be one, is treated
as an
affidavit (t).
When the defendant
has
received
notice of
motion
for decree , he of
course
has
an
opportunity
of
seeing at the same time the evidence
of his
adversary ,
because he
can obtain
copies of the affidavits
from the
office .
He must then , within fourteen days after service
of the notice , file his affidavits in answer to the plaintiff's
case (u). If he wishes to examine an unwilling witness ,
he has now an opportunity
of doing so ; he serves a sub-
pœna on the witness to appear before an examiner of the
court (x)
The
examination
in this case would , it would
in which formerly
the court used to
send an issue to be tried
by a jury
before a common law judge , a prac-
tice which
no longer
exists .

seem , be conducted in the
presence
of both parties , and
the witness would be subject to cross -examination
and re-
examination (y).
When the defendant
has completed his evidence and
filed it, the plaintiff has an opportunity
of filing further
evidence in
reply .
Seven days are allowed
for
this ( ≈) ,
after which time no further
evidence on either side can be
put in to be used
on the
hearing
of the motion
for
decree (a).
But if either party wishes to
cross -examine
any witness whose affidavit
has been
filed , he may give
a notice to the party
on whose behalf the
affidavit was
filed of his desire to cross -examine , and such party must
produce the
witness
before
an
examiner
to
be
cross-
examined , otherwise he cannot
use the affidavit
without
special leave of the court (b).
The hearing of the motion for decree in most cases
has
the same
effect
as the hearing of the cause (c).
The court
can either make a decree
exactly as if the cause had been
brought
to a hearing
by joining
issue, or it may dismiss
the bill, and so put an end to the suit , to the overthrow of
the plaintiff.
On
comparing
the
method of
taking
evidence
just
described
with
that
where
the
cause
is
brought
to
issue
by
replication ,
we
see
the

difference
be-
tween them .

with

to be referred
to s. 31, and not to the manner in

A SUIT

the evidence in chief is put in , without
an opportunity
being given to either party of seeing the evidence
in chief
of the other side : but
each
side, having power to obtain
copies of all the
evidence on the file , knows , before the
hearing , all the evidence
that is to be brought against him ,
and has an opportunity
of considering
the course to
be
adopted
as
to
cross -examination
;
and he also
has the
great advantage of that
cross -examination
being in
open
court .
The only exception to this previous knowledge is
where there is to be a trial of an issue of fact before the
court with a jury , or before the court sitting
as both judge
and jury ; in which
case the trial is , as we have already
mentioned , conducted exactly like a trial at nisi prius.
In the
case of motion
for
decree , on the
other hand ,
each
side has
an
opportunity
of seeing his
adversary's
evidence before completing his own .
There is also usually
much
less
oral examination , and there is none whatever
before the court .
We have now
arrived
at an important
point
in
the
history of a suit , that where
a decree
is
made .
A few
remarks
here
arise upon the
different
characters
which
suits
in
chancery
possess
which
lead
to
very different
results
as to the position which
the litigation takes at the
time a decree is made and its subsequent history .
There
are many
suits
where
the
object is to
obtain
redress
for some grievance , and
as soon
as the grievance
is proved , and an order of the court made for its
redress ,
the whole litigation is at an end.
In an ordinary action
at law, this is nearly
always
the
case .
The object for
which a man brings an action is damages, and
as soon
as
a verdict and judgment
have
been
arrived at , the plaintiff
has obtained everything which the court can give , nothing
then remaining
to be done in the action except to enforce ,
by the aid of the sheriff , the execution of the judgment.
But in chancery it is often quite different ; in a very large
number of instances a single order can by no means fulfil
the whole requirements of the suitors .
It often happens ,

THE
DECREE .
101
particularly
in those numerous
suits where the court un-
dertakes
administrative
business , that the
action of the
court must be continued for a great length of time , even
for the lifetime
of individuals
.
In these cases the decree ,
though in some respects
the most important
order which
the court makes , is not the only order , and indeed is often
not the
order which
decides
the main
questions in con-
troversy between the parties .
It often follows , therefore ,
that when the court makes
a decree
in accordance with
the prayer of the bill , or in accordance with what it con-
siders to be the rights
of the parties , there remains still
a great deal for the court to decide .
The suit has a history
subsequent to the decree which is as important
as that of
the earlier part .
We will take two instances as illustra-
tions . Suppose a man dies , leaving a number of debts , and
also property
and a creditor thinks it necessary
to require
the
estate
to be administered
by the
court , the
prayer
which he makes
is , that the
court
shall
undertake
the
administration
.
The creditor in such a suit
only
takes
care to satisfy the court that he has a claim , and that the
persons who are made defendants are the persons in whom ,
by representation , either
as executors or administrators
,
devisees , or heirs -at-law, the property of the
deceased
is
legally vested.
The decree which is made in answer to such a prayer is
that the
estate shall
be administered
by the court ; it
also gives directions that certain
inquiries
shall be taken
by the
court ,
such
as
an
inquiry
what
property
the
deceased
was possessed
of, where the property is and in
whose possession, what debts the deceased
owed , and who
are entitled
to the property
subject to the payment of
debts ; and it directs that the property
be applied
in a
due course of administration
.
The decree of course takes
various forms to suit the particular
circumstances of each
case (d).
It is obvious in this
case that the decree
is but
recently
provided
peculiar
facilities ,
shortening
the
processes to be gone
(d) The case described in the text
is one for which the legislature
has


102
A SUIT
IN
CHANCERY .
the first
step towards
attaining
the
object of the
suit .
After the decree
is
made , all questions which
arise as to
the validity of
claims of creditors , the
construction
of
the will, the proofs of heirship , and so on , are decided by
subsequent
proceedings .
Another
case , which we may
take , does
not at first
sight
so clearly show why a final
order may not be made at
once .
Suppose
a mortgagee
wish to exercise his right of foreclosing the equity of re-
demption of his mortgagor , that is , make himself absolute
owner of the mortgaged property .
It might seem that , if
he proves by his evidence that the debt is still owing , and
if, before the decree
is made, the mortgagor
does not pay,
a final decree
might be made.
The
court , however , ac-
cording to its ancient customs , will not do this except in
very
special
cases (e) , or by consent of the parties .
It
always
requires
the accounts
to be
taken
between the
parties in a formal
manner , and gives
the
mortgagor
a
very considerable period (always
six months , and usually
nine months ) , after the amount due has been ascertained ,
to pay the money
and it is only after proof of default in
payment at the end of this time that it makes a final order
barring the mortgagor from all interest in the property .
It will be seen that in this
case
the course adopted by
the court , arises
out of the extreme tenderness of the court
in avoiding the slightest
appearance of a harsh or oppres-
sive exercise of strict legal rights .
Many
other of the
various
complications
which
the
court introduces into its decrees , also arise from the same
anxious desire to do complete justice between the parties ,
and to insist upon the observance by the plaintiff seeking
through
before the
decree is made,
(see 15 & 16 Vict. c. 86, ss. 45 and
47) ; but the decree, when made, is
exactly of the same character
as it
used to be when the regular
course
of proceedings
was travelled
over .
(e) E.
g. if the
mortgaged
pro-
perty
belong
to an infant , and the
mortgage
debt
be
more
than its
value , and it be proved
clearly to
the
court that it would be for the
advantage
of the infant that the
mortgagee should take the property
in discharge of his debt .

on Decrees , 685.


INTERLOCUTORY

the aid of the court , of the
duty which he
owes
to the
defendant .
It is with this view , also , that in every pro-
ceeding before the court , the costs incurred
by the parties
are paid in such manner
as the court , which has always
reserved to itself the
most
ample
discretion
upon this
point ,
directs (ƒ) .
A bill is
often
dismissed
without
costs, that is, each
party has to pay his own
costs , even
though the plaintiff fails to establish his case : sometimes ,
even, a victorious party has to
pay all the costs of both
sides (g).
Before describing
the course of events subsequent to
the decree , we must
here revert
to the earlier period of
the
suit , in
order
to
notice
certain
proceedings
which ,
though often of the highest
importance , yet are not part
of the regular
course
of the suit.
From what
we have
seen , it is obvious that in a hostile
suit there often may
be considerable
delay before the
cause
can be heard and
a decree made.
It seldom happens in such a suit that
the interval is less
than
three or four months ; it is often
much longer .
But in many cases
such a delay would be
absolutely
fatal
to the
plaintiff's
hopes
of relief, unless
some earlier interference
for his
protection could be ob-
tained ;
moreover
the parties
often require ,
as we have
seen , particular
orders relative
to the conduct of the pro-
ceedings
.
The
court ,
therefore ,
permits
the parties
at
any stage of the
suit to make applications
to it.
Such
applications
are made for various
purposes , and may be
made in several ways , either by summons obtained at the
chambers of the judge , in which
case the order is made by
the judge in chambers or his chief clerk , after hearing the
parties on the day when the
summons
is returnable
; or
(f) Very different
from the rule
at law, where the defeated party in-
variably
pays all the
costs, except
in the case of nominal
damages .
(g) E. g., in a simple redemption
suit the plaintiff pays all the
costs,
even though he succeeds in redeem-
ing ; though if an improper
defence
be
set
up, the defendant
will
be
made to pay any extra
costs occa-
sioned thereby .


104
A SUIT
IN CHANCERY .
by motion in court ;
or , thirdly , by
a formal
petition
addressed
to the court .
The summons in chambers is usually
adopted only for
less important matters , and
need not here be dwelt upon .
Formal petitions , for matters of any consequence
, are rarely
presented before decree .
Motions
are the principal
pro-
ceedings to which
we now refer.
A motion is
a mere
interlocutory
application , and is sometimes made without
giving any notice
to the other side , but usually is made
after giving two clear days' notice (h) .
We do not intend
here to enumerate all the different
orders which
the
court
will
make
upon
motion ; the
general principle
is , that if time
is of such importance
that great danger may ensue
unless something
be
done
before the
cause
can come to
a hearing , the court will
interfere and make such a temporary order as will prevent
any such disastrous
consequences
; taking
care , however,
as far as possible , that if, upon the more thorough investi-
gation of the facts which the
complete evidence given at
the hearing allows , it should turn out that the order made
upon
a motion was wrong , then it can restore the party
against whom such order was obtained
to as good a posi-
tion as he was in previously .
If, therefore , the plaintiff asks for
some order which
may prove detrimental
to the defendant , and , according
to the evidence furnished
upon the motion , there appears
a possibility that the detriment
so incurred would be an
injustice
to the defendant , the court will , as a price for
its early interference , put the plaintiff upon terms to in-
demnify
the
defendant in
case of the
injustice
being
proved.
The most common of the important
orders asked for on
motion , are orders for injunctions .
A few words may be
(h) Cons . Order , xxxiii .
2.
If
an order is obtained without giving
notice , the
other
side may make
a
motion
to discharge
it ; a motion
made upon notice cannot be so dis-
charged ,
as
the
merits
are
dis-
cussed, each side bringing forward
its evidence .


INJUNCTIONS
.
105
said as to these , which will illustrate
the proceeding by
motion .
An injunction
is a writ issuing out of the court ,
commanding the person against whom it is
addressed
to
abstain from
doing
some specified thing, upon
pain
of
imprisonment
for contempt of court .
When the injunc-
tion is to restrain the defendant from
proceeding with an
action in a court of law , or some
other court , it has been
called a common injunction .
When it restrains
the de-
fendant
from
doing
some specified act, such
as
cutting
down
timber , digging
mines , infringing
a
copyright
or
trade mark , it is called
a
special injunction .
Formerly
there was some
difference between the practice in respect
to the two kinds of injunctions
, but now the distinction
is
unimportant (i) .

When it is intended
to move for an injunction , a
notice is served
upon the defendant , stating that counsel
will move the court on a named day, which must be one
of the days which
are
set apart
for
motions (k ) .
Each
side then has an opportunity of filing affidavits in support
of or against the motion , and this evidence
can continue
to be put in until the motion
is heard .
On the motion
days the court
asks
each
counsel in turn , according to
seniority ( ) , whether he
moves
anything , and thereupon
counsel makes the motion
in the terms of the notice , and

ensues ; but there is no previous formality
of setting it down with the registrars , as is done when the
cause is heard (m ).

notice of it given to the defendant , he is bound
to obey
it, although
the writ itself be not issued till later .
Injunctions
granted
on motion
before
decree will, in
accordance with what has been said , only be of a tempo-
rary character , generally until the hearing of the cause
or
further order.
Sometimes , however , the discussion on the
motion
involves
the whole
merits of the suit
; in such a
case it is not uncommon
for the parties to agree that the
motion
be treated
as the hearing , all formalities
being
waived .
To this the court
readily
consents
, and in such
a case a chancery suit may be instituted
and ended within
the space of a few days.
When there no longer
remains any property under the
control of the court , and no further
question between the
parties arising out of the certificates made in the inquiries
in chambers , a suit in chancery comes
to an end. It often
happens , however , that before that consummation of events
can be arrived at , proposals
are made for
a compromise .
Of course if all the parties interested are sui juris, a com-
promise may be made at any time without the sanction of
the court ; but where , as in chancery so often is the case ,
infants or married women are interested , a compromise of
doubtful
rights
can only be made with the permission of
the court .
This is given if, after a full disclosure of the
facts , the court
is satisfied
that it will be for the real
benefit of the person so under its protection that the com-
promise should be carried out (n ) , in which
case alone will
the compromise be binding.
The proceedings which take place after a decree is made
will not detain us long .
They consist
usually of the fol-
lowing
:-first, a prosecution of inquiries
into facts , such
as
pedigrees , titles
to property , and accounts.
This is
done in the chambers of the judges by their chief clerks :
except where any point of difficulty
arises , when the matter

is brought
before the judge himself ; for which
purpose
the judges , i. e. the master of the rolls and the vice-chan-
cellors (not the judges of the
court
of appeal, for they
only sit in court ), attend in
chambers in the
afternoon
after the rising of the court .
As soon as these inquiries
and accounts have been
finished , a certificate is made out
by the chief clerk stating
the result (o) .
This forms the
basis of fact for the subsequent
steps
in the
cause , the
principal of which is the further
consideration .
The party
who has the carriage of the
decree , i. e. the plaintiff in
many though
not all
cases ,
sets
down the cause
to be
heard upon further consideration , and it takes its place in
the court paper , and is called
on in court in its turn . It
is on this second hearing , if we may so term it , that in
administration
suits the great
contest upon the construc-
tion of wills or other similar
documents takes place .
The
certificate informs the court of all the persons who can set
up any claim ; and each person
mentioned in the certifi-
cate , and having a possible interest , appears
at the hearing
of the further
consideration
by his counsel and argues in
support of his rights.
It is to be noticed , that under the
modern
practice , a decree
may be made in a suit for the
administration
or protection
of property (p), with only a
few of the persons interested being parties .
But the court
requires that all persons who by the chief clerk's
certifi-
cate are shown to have any interest , or possible interest ,
should be served with notice of the
decree , so that
they
may be bound by the
proceedings , and
that
they may
have an opportunity
of appearing
at the further
conside-
ration .
A suit cannot in many cases be entirely disposed
of even on the further
consideration , because it may be

that persons who finally become
entitled
to the corpus of
the estate which
is being administered , may at that time
not even be born .
A suit in such
cases
necessarily re-
mains in a quiescent state for years , the property being ,
however, retained under the protection of the court . When
through the happening
of events, such as the deaths of
tenants for life, or the
attainment
of their majority
by
infants , it becomes
necessary again
to come
to the court
for an order ; the usual mode of obtaining
the order is by
the
presentation
of
a petition .
A petition , as we have
before said, may be presented at any stage of the suit , the
most important
petitions are those to which we now refer ,
the
object of which is to obtain
an order for the pay-
ment or transfer of money or
stock in the hands of the
accountant -general of the court , to which money or stock ,
by such events
as above -mentioned , a new title has accrued
to some person , or an order for conveyance of lands under
similar circumstances .
Petitions
state all
the
facts fully , though
concisely .
They are presented to the lord -chancellor
(except in the
case of one intended
to be heard by the
master
of the
rolls
when it is
presented to that judge ) , who
receives
them
by his
secretary.
The
petition
is
indorsed
by
the secretary with a direction that all parties should attend
the court on
a day named : this is called answering
the
petition . A copy of the petition
is then served upon all par-
ties interested , and on the proper day it appears in the court
paper , and is called on in its turn .
It must be supported
by evidence which consists either of certificates previously
made in the
cause , or formal
evidence of the facts upon
which the title in question depends.
The court exercises
considerable
caution
in
making
the
order, and
herein
consists
the
great
value
of
an
administration
by the
court (g).
(q) The court however necessarily
relies , to no inconsiderable
extent ,
upon the faith
reposed in solicitors ,
which, when
abused ,
may
lead
to
disastrous
consequences .
It there-
fore requires , under penalty of their


SUMMARY
APPLICATIONS
.
109
We have thus traced the history of a suit through
all
the stages of its progress : many of these by consent of
the parties , or the
natural
requirements of the
case , are
often omitted , and the duration of the suit proportionately
shortened .
It only
remains
here to notice
those
cases
where , by special
legislative
enactment , proceedings in
chancery are taken either by a shortened form of suit , or
by summary application without suit .
Where the object
of the suit is the administration
of the personal estate of
a deceased
person , or even in certain cases his real estate ,
a decree
for the administration
may be obtained without
filing a bill, but by a simple summons in chambers served
upon the executor
or administrator
, or a devisee of real
estate entrusted by the will with a power of sale (r) .
From what we have recently
said , in these
cases
the
main value of the proceedings
depends upon what takes
place after
decree , therefore it is a great
advantage
to
avoid the delay and expense of the pleadings
and other
matters which in a regular
suit
precede
the
decree .
In
most of the other cases to which
reference was made in
the last chapter (s) , the summary application
to the court
is made by a petition , entitled
or headed with the name
of the act, and of the name of the subject -matter of the
proceeding .
The
only
case in which
a
summary appli-
cation of this kind is , according
to the practice , made by
a simple motion , is where the application
is to rectify the
register of a joint -stock company , under the 35th section
of the Companies ' Act , 1862.
But sometimes the method
of proceeding by summons , for the purpose of originating
proceedings , is adopted, as in a case under the Charitable
Trust Act , 1853 (t).

CHAPTER VII.
THE SUPERIOR
COURTS
OF
LAW .
FOLLOWING the plan
indicated in the
three preceding
chapters ,
we shall
next
consider
the superior
courts of
common law, their jurisdiction
, and the proceedings in an
action-of which
subjects that first mentioned
will , in
anticipation
of organic changes in this part of our system
of judicature , be very briefly noticed .
By the ancient
Saxon
constitution
there was only one
superior court of justice in the kingdom
; and that
court
had cognisance both of civil and
spiritual causes : viz.
the wittena-gemote , or general
council , which
assembled
annually or oftener , wherever the king kept his Christmas ,
Easter , or Whitsuntide , as well to do private justice
as to
consult
upon
public
business .
After the Conquest
the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction was gradually
diverted
into
an-
other channel ; and a court was established which sat in
the king's hall , thence called by Bracton (a) , and other
ancient
authors , aula regia , or aula regis (b) .
This court
(a) L. 3, tr. 1, c. 7.
(b) This
court
(says Mr. Millar ,
Eng.
Gov.
vol . ii.
p. 108) corres-
ponded in constitution
and origin
with that tribunal which , after
the
accession of Hugh Capet , was gra-
dually formed
out
of the ancient
parliament
of France .
It corres-
ponded also with the Aulic
council
which , after the time of Otho the
Great , arose out of the Diet of the
German
Empire .
There
is reason
to believe that in every considerable
European
kingdom
the
progress of
the feudal
system
gave
rise
to
a
similar
institution , which became
detached from the national
council
by connivance , rather
than
by any
positive
appointment
.
The same
writer
remarks
that , although
in
England
the
institution
of
the
King's
Council is
commonly
as
cribed
to William
the Conqueror ,
yet this must
be understood
with


THEIR
ORIGIN .

was composed of the king's great officers of state resident
in his palace , and usually attendant on his person : such
as the lord high constable and lord
marshal , who chiefly
presided in matters of honour
and of arms ; determining
according to the law military and the law of nations .
Besides
these ,
there
were the
lord
high
steward ,
and
lord great
chamberlain
;
the
steward of the
household ;
the
lord
chancellor
(c) ;
and
the
lord
treasurer ,
who
was the principal adviser in all matters relating to the
revenue.
These
high
officers were
assisted by certain
persons learned
in the laws , who were called the king's
justiciars or justices ; and by the greater barons of parlia-
ment , who sat in the
aula
regia , and formed
a kind of
court of appeal , or rather of advice , in matters of great
moment and difficulty.
All these in their
several
depart-
ments transacted secular business , criminal and civil , and
likewise
attended to matters connected with the revenue :
whilst over all presided
one special magistrate , called the
chief justiciar (d)
or capitalis justiciarius
totius
Angliæ ;
who was also the principal
minister
of state, the
second
man in the kingdom , and by virtue of his office guardian
of the realm in the king's
absence .
This
officer, from
the plenitude of his power , grew at length both obnoxious
to the people and
dangerous to the
government

employed him (e) .
