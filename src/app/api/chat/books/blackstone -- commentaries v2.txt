RENT .
61
We have so far been considering
the cases in which
an
equitable adjustment
of rights
requires an apportionment
of a rent
or an
annuity
in respect of periods
of time .
But in the case of a rent issuing out of or charged upon
lands , it is
obvious
that
analogous
cases
requiring
an
adjustment
of proportionate
parts of the rent , may arise
upon a severance of ownership of particular
parts of the
land subject to the rent .
Where a rent is charged upon
a piece of land the whole
rent
may be distrained
for out
of any part of the land and the owner of the rent is in
no way restricted
in the selection .
It follows
from this
that
where
the
lands
become
divided
among
several
owners , so that different
parts belong to different
indivi-
duals , there could be no apportionment of the rent so as to
render the separate
parts liable only to their proportionate
rent (u) , without
the consent of the owner of the rent (x).
But by the common law this could
not be effected
even
with the consent of the owner of the rent , because it was
long
considered
that
a rent was
one
entire
indivisible
thing ; so if he
released
part
of the
lands
he must
be
deemed
to
release
all (y) .
Consequently
there
was
no
satisfactory
means of
apportioning
the rent upon
par-
ticular
parts , so
as to render them
liable
only for their
apportioned parts (2).
To obviate this
difficulty
a statute (a) has been
passed ,
which
enacted (b) that the
release of a part of the here-
ditaments
charged
should not extinguish
the whole rent-
charge, but should only operate to bar the right to recover
the
context

the rent out of the hereditaments
released
, without pre-
judice , nevertheless , to the rights of all persons interested
in the hereditaments
remaining
unreleased , and not con-
curring
in or confirming
the
same (c) .
It is presumed
that this would
extend to enable a release
to be made of
part of the lands from
a proportionate
part of the rent,
and of the remainder of the lands from the residue , thus
effecting a complete and satisfactory apportionment .
Where an owner of a rent -service purchases , or acquires
by descent or devise, part of the land
out of which
the
rent issues, by the common law the owner of the remainder
of the lands
is released from an apportioned
part of the
rent (d).
In the
case
of a rent -charge, if part of the
lands descend to the owner of the rent - charge , there also
is
an apportionment
(e) ; but , on the
other hand , if he
purchase or accept by devise part of the lands , the whole
rent-charge is thereby extinguished (ƒ) .
To those cases ,
however , where as above
mentioned
a rent -service
would
be if possible apportioned , there is the exception
that if
it consist of personal
services
to the lord which by their
nature are incapable of apportionment , or if it consists of
rendering yearly
" a horse,
a golden
spear , or a clover ,
gilliflower or such like, "
then
the rent is entirely ex-
tinguished
upon
any
part
of the
lands
becoming
the
property of the lord (g) .
Unless , indeed, the services
be for the benefit of the
(c) This
saving is
probably
only
declaratory
of what
the law would
have
been
even if it
had
been
omitted , since the owner of part of
lands
charged , if obliged to pay the
whole
rent, is entitled
to demand
proportionate
contribution
from the
owner of the remainder
; this right
ought of course to be unaffected by
any contract
between the latter and
the owner of the rent .

public , as to repair
a bridge , or keep a beacon , or for the
advancement of justice , in which
case the liability for the
whole
rent
continues
charged
upon the land
remaining
in the hands of the tenant ( ).
Where a tenant has been
evicted from part of the lands the rent will be apportioned ,
and he will be released pro tanto (i), and it is said (k)
the
same result would
hold if the tenant
lose the land
through
the
act of God,
as if part be washed away by
the sea.
Previously to the
statute above mentioned , the
legis-
lature had provided for the apportionment
of rents where
part of the land is taken
for the purposes
of a railway
or other
similar public company ( ) ,
or for building a
church(m).
It may be mentioned
that in these cases equity antici-
pated the recent
statutory changes of the law.
Where
the rent -charge was granted out of an equitable estate , no
release of part ever affected
the right to the remainder .
At common law, if the reversion to which a rent -service
was incident
became
partitioned
upon a descent or devise
to several persons , the rent was apportioned (n ) , and this
was also the
case
upon a conveyance of the reversion in
part
of the
lands ,
subject
however
to the necessity of
attornment
or recognition of title under the conveyance by
the tenant (o) .
Attornment is now by statute (p) rendered
unnecessary , and therefore the owner of a rent - service , of
whatever kind, is at liberty
to devise or convey it to several
persons at pleasure , and the
devisees
or
assignees may
make
several
distresses .
Modern cases have extended the
same power of disposition
to owners of rent -charges (q) .

Payment of
rent.
Tithes.
With reference to the paymentof rent , if no particular
place is mentioned in the reservation or grant , the regular
place for the payment is upon the land subject to it (r) ; but
in the case of the king the payment
must be either to his
officers at the exchequer or to his receiver in the country (s).
The rent is demandable
at sunset on the
day fixed for
payment (t) ,
though
it
would
seem that it cannot
be
enforced till after midnight (u) .
The exact hour when it
is due was formerly , before the apportionment
statutes to
which we have referred were passed , of considerable im-
portance (x) ; it is now of little importance except in those
cases which do not come within those statutes .
Upon paying the rent
a tenant may make all proper
deductions , such, for instance , as rates and taxes paid by
him in obedience
to the law, yet ultimately
payable by the
landlord (y).
Having said so much as to the general nature of a rent
and rent -charge , we are
here led to digress
somewhat in
order to dwell
for a short time
upon
a particular
species
of rent-charge , which
from the interest
attaching
to its
origin
and
history ,
and
from certain
peculiarities
at-
tending it, requires
special notice .
We refer to the rent
now universally
payable in lieu of tithes .
Tithes formerly
constituted
a separate species of incorporeal hereditament ,
being the right to the tenth part of the produce of man's
industry , which used to be rendered in kind ; the tenth of
the produce of a hayfield , or one in every ten lambs be-
longed to the tithe
owner .
Obviously , assuming the right
to exist , it was detrimental
to the interests of all persons
(r) Co. Litt.
201.
In
order
to
take
advantage
of a condition
of
re-entry , the demand must be made
a convenient
time before sunset ; see

concerned
that the
actual
things
themselves
should
be
given, except at least in a very primitive
state of society ,
where men combined in their
own persons both the cha-
racters of producer
and consumer .
Consequently
many
partial
inroads
upon
the practice of payment
in kind
have long been established .
Even local acts of parliament
have been by no
means uncommon , under which
a corn
rent , i. e., a rent consisting of so many bushels of corn or
their market
value ,
or an
ordinary
money rent
became
payable in lieu of tithes
in the
parishes , for which
the
acts were passed.
In other places there were what were
called
real
compositions , i. e. ,
agreements
between
the
owners of the lands
and the parsons or vicars
to whom
the tithes
belonged
made with the consent of the ordi-
nary ; and again
there were established in many places
customs
under
which
the tithes
were
paid
in
some
particular manner , called customs de modo decimandi (z).
There
were
formerly
numerous
questions
fruitful
in
litigation as to what
constituted
a good real composition
or a good modus .
The
change of the law has rendered
all the learning on these points
obsolete
.
Suffice it here
to say , that to support a real composition , it was necessary
either to produce the deed
creating it, or to show the ex-
istence
of a deed dated later than the
commencement of
legal
memory , i. e. , the first year of Richard
I. (a) , and
prior
to the year
13 Eliz . , in which
year
a statute was
passed
disallowing
them for the future
to be made (b) ,
(z) Where lands were in the pos-
session
of the king, or of spiritual
persons or corporations , there
was ,
also , apræscriptio de non decimando .
Thus
a vicar paid
no tithes
to a
rector for his glebe, for ecclesia deci-
mas non solvit
ecclesiæ.

Commuta-
tion of
tithes.
and to support a modus it was necessary to show that the
custom
had
universally
existed , i.
e. , before the
com-
mencement of the reign of Richard
I. , because
a modus
presumes a lost grant made before the memory of man.
Moreover
the modus
was held to be bad if it did not
comply with certain rules (c).
Provision
has been
now made for the commutation of
all tithes , real compositions , and modus into rent varying
only with
the
average
price of corn.
This
has
been
accomplished
by numerous
acts , the principal of which
was
passed in
the
year
1836 (d).
Under
these acts
the amount
payable
by each
parish
to the tithe
owner
has been ascertained , and stated as the value of a fixed
number of imperial
bushels
of wheat , barley , and oats,
and in order to determine the
money payable , a return
is
annually
made
by the
controller
of
corn ,
which
return states the average
price of wheat , barley , and oats ,
during
the preceding
seven
years (e) ;
upon this
basis
all tithes
are now paid .
The whole
amount
payable by
the
parish
is also apportioned
upon the various
parcels
of land
throughout
the parish , due provision
being made
for
the respective rights of landowners ,
both with re-
gard to the nature of the land , and also to their
existing
right to
total
or
partial
exemption
at the time of the

apportionment .
Moreover
provision
is
made for re-ar-
ranging the apportionment
as occasion shall
require (ƒ).
Under
the operation of these acts all lands in a parish
where
the apportionment
has been duly made, are abso-
lutely discharged from the payment of
all
tithes
(g),
and
instead
of
the tithes
,
the rent

Although the whole state
of
circumstances
is
changed
,
still
,
since the rights and liabilities which now
subsist
have their origin
in
the ancient
form
of
tithes
,
it
is
not
uninteresting
briefly
to
trace
their
history
,

is

liarities

tithes
.
We have seen
(h)
that our information
as
to
the division
History
of
of
parishes
is
somewhat scanty
;
the history
of
the origin
of
tithes
,
which though
intimately
connected with that
of
parishes
,
dates
from
a
still earlier
period
,
is
equally in-
volved
in
obscurity
,
or
even
more
so
.
A reasonable
account
of
them
,
and one probably not materially
different
from the true one
,
is
that they were
at
first
voluntary
offerings made by the owners
of
property for the purpose
of
supporting
ecclesiastical
institutions
.
The
influence
which the clergy
exercised over men's minds would pro-
bably be exerted
to
the utmost
in
urging the fulfilment
of
the moral duty
of
maintaining

Afterwards

kingdoms
of the heptarchy , Mercia and Northumberland
,

was given

Other mention of them in the Saxon laws

The voluntary
nature of tithes
continued , however , for
some time
afterwards
to
the
extent ,
as
before-men-
tioned (k) , of their
not
being
appropriated
to any
par-
ticular church .
Some relics of these arbitrary
appropria-
tions
remain
to
the
present
day, in those
cases
where
portions of tithes in one parish are due to the parson of a
neighbouring
parish , and where the ownership of tithes is
vested in corporations
and persons other than the parson .
Many, through
a feeling of caprice , or perhaps the more
effective incentive of a superstitious
desire to have masses
said for their souls , paid their tithes to a monastery
or
other religious
house , either already in existence or then
founded .
From this source tithes afterwards
came to be
possessed
by laymen .
For
upon
the dissolution
of the
monasteries by Henry VIII . , their
lands
and other pos-
sessions , including of course the tithes , became vested in
the
king ( ),
who
shortly
afterwards
granted
them
to
various
persons , the letters
patent granting
them
being
confirmed by statute (m) .
From this period tithes , when
held
by a layman (n) , have been
treated in all respects
like landed property , and are subject to all its incidents (o) .

could not even in that

Mixed tithes

at common
law ,
although
in
particular
places
even some of
these
were made so by custom (x).
It will be seen that there
is but slight difference between predial and mixed tithes ,
at least in modern days when the culture of land involves
as much science
and labour
as the care of beasts or sheep.
Personal
tithes
were,
however ,
quite
distinct ;
they
were taken from the profits
arising
from the

than

In very early
times
they must
have been of no inconsiderable import-
ance ; indeed , in the
sixteenth
century , this must
still
have been the case , for we find that by 2 & 3 Ed . 6 , c. 13 ,
it is enacted that every person exercising merchandise , &c .

ing paid personal tithes , should pay for his personal tithes
one -tenth part of his clear gains , his charges and expenses ,
according to his estate , condition , or degree , to be therein
allowed
and
deducted .
This statute would at first seem
to include
the income arising from all trades and profes-
sions , and this was the view formerly
held (y) ; but it has
long become so far obsolete that this kind of tithe
has
long
been
nowhere
paid
except
in the
case
of
sea
fisheries ( ) and
corn mills (a) ,
and , very
rarely , river
fisheries (b) .
Moreover these are now in any case only to
be payable where
there is a custom
to pay them .
The
important distinction
between personal
and
other
tithes
was
that the former
consist
only of the tenth of the
clear profits
after deducting
all expenses, but the
latter
consist of a tenth of the produce without any such de-
duction .
We may here notice that special custom has in certain
places rendered
titheable
some things which
are not so of
common right ;
for
instance ,
stone , slate , or lime
from
quarries ,
and
tin ,
lead,
coal,
and
other
products

Another
division into
greatand
small tithes.
Acts apply to all these tithes , as well as those upon fisheries
and corn mills (e) .
Another
division of tithes more interesting
to us at the
present
day is that
into great
and small tithes .
The
former comprehended those tithes which ordinarily
would
be of the greater value , such as those of corn , hay , wood ;
the latter those of the lesser vegetables, such
as
hops,
potatoes ,
turnips ,
herbs , flax ,
apples,
and
other
fruit ,
clover (when not made into hay) , madder , woad , &c. This
division
was, according to the nature of the vegetable , and
not
the quantity of it in any particular
parish (ƒ) .
It
depended , however , not upon what would be a satisfactory
classification
to a naturalist , but arose solely by custom .
The catalogue of articles constituting
the two classes need
not
here
be
given ,
but the
distinction
is
important ,
because
in those parishes where there is a rector and an
incumbent
vicar the great tithes were usually payable
to
the
rector ,
and the
small
tithes
to the
vicar .
When
monasteries and other spiritual
corporations
acquired the
property in parsonages , and consequently
tithes , it was
usual for them to delegate the duty of ministering
in the
parish to some priest , and it was for his support
as their
vicar that they set apart the
small
tithes .
Afterwards
,
sundry statutes were passed
for the purpose of securing
a sufficient endowment , at the discretion of the
ordinary ,
out of that of the parsonage or rectory .
The
rector
is
prima facie entitled
to
all
tithes
,
both great and small
;
and payment
to
the rector
is
a
sufficient discharge against
the vicar
,

them

endowment or give such evidence as will
be accepted
as
proving it by prescription , for the court will not presume
any thing , in the absence of an endowment , in favour
of
the vicar against
the rector (z).
No other person than
a
rector or vicar , such as a curate , has in general any claim
to tithes (a).
Since the division
of great and small
tithes is now well
established , and the latter
are considered as belonging to
the vicar , if he produces evidence of an endowment , the
onus probandi
in respect of any article
claimed by the
rector , if ordinarily
a small tithe , is thrown upon him ; so
that he must show that some different arrangement
to the
usual
one
had
been , or by necessary presumption
must
have been made, in the distribution
of tithes in his parish ,
subsequent
to the endowment
and prior to the disabling
statute of Elizabeth (6).
On the other hand , usage will
be readily accepted
as
a proof in favour
of the vicar
of
the extension of the original
endowment to some
article
not ordinarily a vicar's tithe (c) .
Under the Commutation Acts the respective rights of the
owners of great
and
small
tithes
were of
course
duly
preserved , and proportional
rent charges substituted .
for non-
rent.
Returning from
this digression on the subject of tithes Remedies
to the subject of rents in general , we come next to con- paymentof
sider the remedies which their owner
possesses
in case of
nonpayment . These are of two sorts ; first , those which are
provided
by the contract ,
and, secondly , those which are
conferred by law independently of contract .

Distress.
In all modern leases
and deeds creating
rent
or a rent
charge , there is inserted
a covenant on the part of the
lessee or the owner of the land , subject to the charge to
pay the rent , from which covenant arises a right to sue
for the
rent , with which
right of action
there may also
be classed the right which
arises from the implied
con-
tract to
pay for
the
use
and
occupation
of the
pre-
mises (d) .
These causes of action need no further remark
here.
But , besides , there is usually
inserted in leases
a pro-
vision , that if default be made in payment of the rent , the
lessor may re-enter upon
the land , oust the tenant , and
resume the possession and estate which
he had before the
lease.
The
severe
penalty which
a stringent
application
of this
provision
would
inflict
upon
the
tenant
is
not
favoured by the law.
The
Court
of Chancery first took
upon itself to relieve
a tenant
from the penalty , even a
long time
after his being ejected , upon the terms of pay-
ing the rent due and interest thereon , together with all
costs .
This remedy has recently been also given to courts
of law ; but now the tenant must , whether in equity or at
law, apply for relief within six months from the execution
under the ejectment being executed (e) .
Of the
many
characteristics
of
rents ,
the
peculiar
remedy of distress which
the law gives is amongst
the
most interesting , and at the same time most important .
A distress (f),
districtio , is the taking
of a personal
chattel out of the
possession of the wrongdoer
into the
custody of the party injured , to procure a satisfaction
for
the wrong committed .
A distress may be levied for nonpayment of rent fixed ,
and due under an actual demise, or for nonperformance of
a duty ; cattle also may be distrained damage-feasant , that

his grass , or the like , in which
case the owner of
the soil
may distrain
them till satisfaction be made him
for the injury he has thereby sustained .
(5. ) For various
penalties
inflicted
by
act of
parliament ,
a
remedy by
distress
and
sale
is given
(n ) ;
for
the
particulars
of
which we must
have recourse to the statutes themselves :
remarking
only , that such distresses are partly analogous
to the ancient distress at common law, as being
reple-
viable
and the like ;
and partly resemble the common
law process of execution , by seizing and selling the goods
of the debtor
under a writ of fieri facias , of which
we
shall hereafter speak.
The
following
remarks will, for the most
part , be re-
stricted
to the case of a distress for
nonpayment of rent
where the
relation
of
landlord
and
tenant (o) subsists
between the
parties
respectively
distraining
and
dis-
trained upon , and there is a reversion in the distrainor .
2ndly ;
as to the things which
may be distrained , two
general rules
may imprimis
be laid down , and a distinc-
tion must be taken .
( 1.) All chattels personal are liable
to be
distrained ,
unless
particularly
protected
or
ex-
empted.
Instead
therefore of
mentioning
what
things
are distrainable , it will be easier to recount
those which
are
not
so , with the reason of their
particular

tions (p).
(2.) Goods . and
chattels
upon
the
premises
demised belonging
to
a
stranger
are
distrainable
, for
otherwise a door would be opened
to infinite
frauds upon
the landlord, and a stranger
has his remedy over if by
default
of the
tenant
his
chattels
are
distrained .
A
landlord
accordingly
may distrain
upon the goods of an
underlessee being
upon the demised
premises , although
as between
lessor
and underlessee
there is no privity.
(3. ) Also a distinction
as regards the liability of goods to
seizure must
here
be noticed
between the
case
where a
distress is put in (concerning
which
alone we now in-
quire ), and that where
an execution is levied .
Should
a
judgment creditor of the tenant
levy an
execution
upon
his
goods , the
sheriff will be justified
in seizing
such
goods
and
chattels
only
as
belong
to the tenant ,
and
cannot lawfully
seize those of a third person upon
the
premises .
In the
case just put , if rent
be due to the landlord ,
he should proceed (as will
presently be shown at greater
length ) under the stat . 8 Ann . c . 14 , s . 1 , and , on demand
made
to the
sheriff , will
entitle
himself to arrears not
exceeding one year's rent , which
may be levied
in addi-
tion to the execution
money
upon the tenant's
goods.
The County Court Act ( 19
& 20 Vict . c.
108 ) contains
a provision
(sect. 75) analogous
to that of the statute of
Anne .
It
enacts that
where
goods in a tenement for
which rent is due
are
taken
in
execution
under
the
warrant
of a county court , the
landlord
may claim
the
rent
due
to
him by delivering
a notice to the bailiff
making
the levy , and such bailiff shall then , in making
the levy , distrain
also for the rent so claimed (q) .
Generally
speaking
then , whatsoever goods and
chat-
tels a landlord
finds upon the demised premises , whether
they in fact belong to the tenant
or to a stranger , are

distrainable
by him
for rent .
With regard , however , to
a stranger's
beasts which are
found
on the tenant's land ,
the following
points
are to be noticed .
If they are put
in by consent of the owner
of the beasts , they are dis-
trainable
immediately
afterwards
for rent in arrear
by
the landlord ( ).
So also if a stranger's
cattle break the
fences , and commit
a trespass
by coming
on the land ,
they are distrainable
immediately
by the lessor
for
his
tenant's rent , as a punishment
to the owner of the beasts
for the wrong committed through his negligence (s) .
But
if the lands were not sufficiently
fenced
so as to keep out
cattle , the landlord
cannot distrain
them , till they have
been levant
and couchant
(levantes
et cubantes ), on the
land ; that is, have been lying down and rising up on the
premises for a night and a day , without
pursuit made by
the owner of them (t) ; and then the law presumes , that
the
owner
may
have
notice
whither
his
cattle
have
strayed , and it is his
own negligence
not to have taken
them away.
Yet , if the lessor or his tenant were bound
to repair the fences
and did not , and thereby the cattle
escaped
into their grounds , without the negligence
or de-
fault of the owner ; in this
case , though the cattle
may
have been levant and couchant , yet they are not distrain-
able for rent , till
actual
notice
has been given
to the
owner that they
are there , and
he neglects
to
remove
them (u) : for the law will not suffer the landlord
to take
advantage of his own or his tenant's wrong (x).

premises ,
certain
things
have been for
special reasons
excepted :—
1. At common law things affixed to the freehold , and
which
thus
become part of it, cannot
be distrained
for
rent ( 1) , because
that
cannot be a pledge which
cannot
be restored in statu quo to the owner , and a part of the
freehold is not severable from it without some detriment
being caused to the thing itself in its removal .
(2) Because
what is fixed
to the freehold
is part of the thing de-
mised, and the nature of the remedy by distress is not to
resume part of the thing itself for the rent , but only to
take
those things which are brought
upon the premises
by way of satisfaction for it . (3) A third reason assigned is
that the freehold itself would
be
injured by the removal
of that which is affixed to it.
Such things , therefore , as
caldrons , windows ,
doors ,
and
chimney -pieces ,
are
not
distrainable , for
they
savour of the
realty .
For
this
reason also corn growing
could not be distrained
: till the
stat. 11 Geo . 2 , c. 19 , s . 8 , empowered
landlords
to distrain.
corn, grass ,
or other products
of the earth , and to
cut
and gather them when ripe .
So charters concerning land
are not distrainable , because in contemplation of law they
are parcel of the freehold .
Questions of this kind often
arise in reference to machinery ; and in any such
case
the difficulty
usually
lies
in
determining
whether
the
machinery
when
fixed was parcel of the freehold .
Now
this
is
a question of fact depending
principally on two
lord distraining within his seignory ,
and a landlord
distraining
for rent
reserved on his own lease ; for the
lord
has
nothing to
do with the
land or the fences, and so it is not
material
to him whether
the fences
are repaired
or not ; but it is other-
wise of a landlord , for
he himself
ought
to repair , or to provide
that
his
tenants
repair
them , else
he
would
take
advantage
of his own
wrong."
But "if the cattle escape
into the land without
any defect of
the fences ,
or
where
the
tenant
of the
land
in
which they
are
distrained
is not
bound
to
repair
the
fences, through
the
defect
of
which the
cattle
escape
and
are
distrained , it is immaterial
to the
lord or landlord whether
they are
levant
and
couchant
or
not."

considerations
;
first , the mode of annexation
to the soil
or fabric of the house , and the extent to which the chattel
is united thereto, as whether it can easily and
safely be
removed
without
injury
to itself
or
to the
building.
Secondly , the question
depends
on the object and purpose
of the annexation , whether it was for the permanent
and
substantial
improvement of the dwelling , or merely for a
temporary purpose , or the more complete enjoyment and
use of the thing annexed as a chattel (y).
2. Things
sent or delivered to a person exercising
a par-
ticular trade , to be kept , carried , wrought
or manufactured
in the way of his trade ; for instance goods pledged with a
pawnbroker (~) , or on the premises of an auctioneer for
sale (a ) , a horse standing
in a blacksmith's
shop , mate-
rials sent to a weaver to be wove, to a fuller to be cleaned
and dyed, or cloth to a tailor to be made up , are privi-
leged for the sake of trade and
commerce, which
could
not be
carried
on if such things , under
such
circum-
stances, could be distrained
for rent
due from the person
in whose custody they are.
Such
things are privileged
on the ground of public policy , to encourage a feeling of
confidence in those who would
bail their goods for skill
to be exercised upon them , and are supposed in common
presumption
not to belong to the owner of the house , but
to his customers . If the goods are sent to the premises
for the
purpose
of being
dealt with in the way of the
party's trade , and are to remain upon the premises until
that
purpose is
answered
and
no longer , they are
not
distrainable , but if they are sent thither
for the purpose
of remaining
there
merely at the will of the owner , no
work having to be done upon them , they will be distrain-
able , and the party claiming
exemption
is bound clearly
to show that he is within one or other of the acknow-

to the rule , which
allows
all
such
things
as are on the demised premises to be distrained (b).
3.
Goods
at an inn whilst on the premises cannot be
distrained (c).
4. The implements
of a man's
trade or profession ,
as
the axe of a carpenter, the books of a scholar , and the
like , are privileged
from distress for rent , if they be in
actual use at the time , or if there be any other sufficient
distress on the premises , but not otherwise (d).
They are
said to be thus
privileged
sub
modo
for the sake of the
public , because
the taking them away would
disable
the
owner from serving the commonwealth in his station (e).
5.
Beasts
of the plough (averia
caruca ) and
sheep ,
which improve
the land , are also privileged
if there be
other
sufficient
distress
upon
the
premises (f).
And
perhaps the true
reason, why these and the tools of a
man's
trade
were
privileged
at
the common
law,
was
because the distress was originally intended to compel the
payment of the rent , not as a satisfaction for
its
non
-
pay-
ment
and therefore
,
to
deprive the party
of
the instru-
ments and means
of

would
counteract

man is riding him, or an axe in a man's
hand
cannot be
distrained for rent (h).
7. Nothing is distrainable
for rent , which may not be
rendered again in as good plight as when it was distrained :
for which reason milk , fruit , and the like , cannot be dis-
trained , a distress at common law being only in the nature
of a pledge or security , to be restored in the
same plight
when the debt is paid .
So , anciently ,
sheaves
or shocks
of corn could
not be
distrained ,
because
some damage
must needs accrue in their removal , but a cart loaded with
corn might ; as that
could be safely restored .
But now
by statute 2 Will . & M.
sess .
1 ,
c. 5, corn in sheaves
or
cocks ,
or loose in the straw , or hay in barns
or ricks ,
or
otherwise , may be distrained
as well as other chattels (i) ,
but produce which has been sold by the sheriff under
an
agreement by the
purchaser
that it shall be used and
expended on the land cannot be distrained ( ).
8. As every thing distrained
is presumed to be the pro-
perty of the wrongdoer , it will
follow that
such things
wherein no man
can have an absolute and valuable
pro-
perty (as cats and animals feræ naturæ ( 1) ) cannot be dis-
trained .
Yet if deer
(which
are feræ naturæ) are kept in
a private inclosure for the purpose of sale or profit , this so
far changes their
nature , by reducing
them to a kind of
stock
or
merchandise , that they may be distrained
for
rent (m).
9. Goods which are in the custody of the law are in general
not distrainable for rent , for it would
be a contradiction.
in terms to say-that what
the law had laid
hands upon
could
by legal
process
be
removed
out
of
its
grasp .

Hence goods which
have been
taken in execution cannot
be distrained
for rent .
In this particular
case , however ,
the statute
8 Anne , c.
14 (n), already
briefly
noticed ,
applies to entitle
the landlord
of premises
whereon
an
execution is levied to
one year's rent (if so much
be in
arrear)
before removal of the goods seized
by the sheriff .
Where indeed the demised premises
are let at a weekly
rent , or for any other term less than a year , the right of
the landlord to claim for rent in arrear is restricted (o) .
Also , by stat .
14 & 15 Vict.
c. 25 ,
s . 2 , growing
crops
seized
and sold under a writ of execution , so long as they
remain on the land , are, in default of other sufficient dis-
tress , liable
to the landlord
for rent which may become
due to him after such seizure and sale , and to the remedy
by distress for recovery of such rent .
The
rule which
obtained
at common law exempting
from
distress
chattels in custodiâ legis
has further
been
relaxed by various statutory provisions below cited (p) .
3rdly . Let
us
consider how a distress
may be
taken , srdly . How
disposed
of, or avoided .
distress
may be
taken, dis-
avoided.
In the first place, then , a distress for rent in arrear must posedof, or
be made by day (g).
And , when
a person
intends
to
make it, he must , by himself or his bailiff , armed with a
distress
warrant , enter on the demised premises and make
a seizure, formerly during
the
continuance of the lease,
but
now (r) , if the tenant
holds over, the landlord
may
distrain within six months after the determination
of the
lease ; provided
his own title or interest , as well
as the
tenant's possession , continue at the time of the distress (s) .

A lessor not finding sufficient
distress on the premises ,
formerly could resort no where else , and therefore tenants ,
who
were knavish , made it a practice
to convey away
their
goods and
stock fraudulently from the houses
or
lands
demised , in
order to
cheat
their landlords .
But
now the landlord
may distrain
any goods of his
tenant ,

clandestinely , wherever he finds
them within thirty days after , unless they have been

so takes
an insufficient
distress , he may take a second
distress to complete his remedy ( ≈).
A distress must be proportioned
to the thing distrained
for .
Bythe statute of Marlbridge
, 52 Hen. 3 , c. 4 , if any
man
take
a great
or unreasonable
distress , for
rent in
arrear, he shall
be heavily amerced for the same .
As if
the landlord
distrains
two oxen for twelve -pence rent ; the
taking
of both is an unreasonable
distress ;
though if
there were no other distress
nearer the value to be found ,.
he might reasonably have distrained one of them (a) .
The
remedy for
an
excessive
distress
is
by action
on the
case (b) founded
upon
the
statute
of
Marlbridge
;
an
action of trespass is not maintainable
upon this account ,
there being no injury at the common law (c) .
When the distress
has
been taken
and
notice
of it
given
and an appraisement
made in compliance with the
statute (d) , the next
consideration

be
carried to some pound , and there be impounded

But , in their way thither , they may be rescued

the owner , in case
the distress was taken without
cause ,
or contrary to law :
as if no rent
be due ; if they were

Geo.

which
was made for the
benefit of landlords
as well
as tenants , a person distrain-
ing for rent
may turn
any part
of the
premises , upon
.which a distress is taken , into a pound , pro hac vice , for
the securing of such distress .
If live animals were dis-
trained
and impounded in a common pound - overt, their
owner was at common law bound to take notice of it at
his peril ; but if in any special pound -overt , so constituted
for this particular
purpose , the distrainor
was required
to
give notice to the owner :
and, in both
these
cases , the
owner , and not the distrainor , was bound to provide
the
beasts with food and
necessaries
.
But if they were put
in a pound -covert , as in a stable or the like , the
landlord
or distrainor
had
to feed
and
sustain
them (g ) .
Now,
however , under
two
recent
statutes ( ),
horses,
cattle ,
and
sheep distrained
must
be supplied with food by the
distrainor ,
or if
confined
without
sufficient
food
and
water for more than twelve hours , may be supplied there-
with by any person at the cost of the owner , and the
dis-
tress may even be sold for reimbursement
of the expenses
thus incurred .
The mode of impounding
crops when distrained
under
11 Geo . 2 ,
c. 19 , is provided for by s. 8 of that
statute ,
and household
goods,
or other
dead
chattels , which
are
liable
to be stolen or damaged by weather , ought to be
impounded in a pound - covert ,
else
the
distrainor
must
answer for the consequences
.
When impounded , the
goods
were formerly ,
as was
before observed
, only in the nature of a pledge or security
to compel the performance of satisfaction ; and upon this

DISTRESS .

account it was held ( ) , that the distrainor
is not at liberty
to work or use a distrained
beast.
And thus the law still
continues with regard to beasts
taken damage -feasant , and
distresses for
suit
or services ;
which must
remain im-
pounded , till the owner makes
satisfaction ;
or contests
the right of distraining
, by replevying
the chattels .
To
replevy (replegiare , that
is , to take back the pledge ) was ,
when a person distrained upon applied to the sheriff or his
officers , and had the distress returned into his own posses-
sion ; upon giving good security to try the right of taking
it in a suit of law, and , if that were determined
against
him , to return the cattle or goods once more into the hands
of the distrainor
.
This is called a replevin , of which more
will be said hereafter (k).
At present I shall only observe ,
that as a distress is at common law in nature of a security
for the rent, a replevin
answers the same end to the dis-
trainor as the distress itself ;
since the party replevying
gives security to return the distress if the right be deter-
mined against him .
A distress , though it put the owner
to inconvenience ,
and was therefore
a punishment
to him, yet , if he con-
tinued
obstinate , and would
make no
satisfaction
or pay-
ment , afforded at common law no remedy
at all to the
distrainor .
Though
for a debt
due to the crown , unless
paid within forty days , the distress was always saleable ( ).
And for an amercement
imposed at a court leet , the lord
may also sell the
distress (m ) ;
partly
because , being the
king's court of record , its
process
partakes
of the royal
prerogative (n ) ; but principally
because it is in the nature
of an execution to levy a legal debt .
And so, in the case
of a statutory
distress , which is also in the nature of an
execution , the power of sale is likewise
usually given to
effectuate and complete the remedy.
And in like manner ,

acts of parliament (o) , in all
cases of

for rent , ifthe tenant or owner do not , within five days (p)
after the distress is taken , and notice of the cause
thereof
given him , replevy the
same with sufficient security , the
distrainor , with the sheriff
or constable , shall
cause the
same to be appraised by two
sworn appraisers , and sell
the same towards
satisfaction of the rent and charges ;
rendering
the overplus , if any , to the owner himself (9) .
And by this means a full and entire satisfaction may now
be had for rent in arrear by distress , a remedy originally
given at common law ; and sale consequent thereon
, which
is added by act of parliament .
Before quitting this
subject I must
observe that
two
points were long ago decided (r) which
had an important
bearing upon the law of distress- 1st , that where an entry
upon
premises
is permitted
or an authority
is given by
the law an
abuse of it by the party to whom it is thus
given will render him a trespasser ab initio . If a landlord
who distrains for rent works or kills the
distress , the law
adjudges that the wrong -doer entered for the express
pur-
pose of doing the tortious
act , and because
the act which
demonstrates the original intention
is a trespass
he shall
be a trespasser ab initio .
The 2nd point decided was that
a mere non-feasance cannot have the retrospective operation.
just indicated , for this reason, that a bare non -feasance
is
not a trespass. If therefore a landlord distrains for rent ,
and thereupon the lessee tenders him the rent in arrear ,
and requires the goods distrained
to be delivered
up to
him , a refusal on the part of the landlord
thus to deliver
them , will not make him a trespasser ab initio .
Though
here a distinction
must
be taken
between a tender
made
before and one made after the impounding
of the
goods

must
elapse
before
sale
(Harper v. Taswell,

C. & P. 166) ; and the tenant may
replevy
after
that
time in case the
distress is not sold .( Jacobs v. King ,
5 Taunt. 541.)

DISTRESS .
89
if the tender be made and
refused
before the goods are
impounded , there will be vested
in the tenant
a right of
action , whereas a tender made after the impounding
is too
late (8).
It is clear
that
this
doctrine
of trespass ab
initio , if
strictly applied , must
bear
extremely hard
on landlords
who , having
entered
lawfully to distrain , would
by com-
mitting any subsequent abuse of the legal power conferred
and thus
exercised
become liable in
trespass for the
original
entry
and
subsequent
continuance
upon
the
premises on which the distress was levied .
Therefore , by
the statute
11
Geo . 2 , c. 19 ,
s . 19 , it was provided
that
where any distress shall be made for any rent justly due,
and any irregularity
or unlawful act shall be afterwards
done by the party distraining
or his agent , the distress
shall not be deemed unlawful nor the distrainor
be deemed
a trespasser
ab
initio , but damages
may be recovered by
action for the wrong done .
By this statute accordingly in
the particular
case of landlord
and tenant , the hardship
flowing
from the doctrine
as to trespass
ab
initio
was
removed . The
1st and 2nd sections of the statute just cited
are
material
in
reference to the remedies of a landlord
against his tenant .
By them is provided a very stringent
remedy in case of the fraudulent
removal of goods by a
tenant . If goods of the tenant are fraudulently
conveyed
away from the demised premises , they are made liable to a
distress within the period of thirty days to whatever place
they
may
be removed-liability
thus
attaching
to the
particular goods themselves and not merely attaching
to
them
so long as they continue
the goods of the tenant .
Sect. 2 provides , however , that
no landlord
shall
take or
seize goods
as a distress which have been bond fide sold for
valuable
consideration
to persons not privy to the fraud .
This
2nd
section consequently operates in
defeasance

Origin of.
the provisions of the 1st, and takes all goods thus sold out
of its operation .
Let us suppose that a party having possession of goods
fraudulently
removed by a tenant
holds them
innocently
as a bailee or as a donee , without having
given value for
them .
In this
case the liability of the goods to distress.
will continue , so that the close or house of the person in
whose possession they are
may be entered , and his locks
even may be broken without
any previous request , in order
to effect a recaption of the goods .
And though
this may
seem hard upon the individual
: we must remember
that
goods fraudulently
removed under the circumstances sup-
posed are not usually secreted
in a man's
close or house
without his privity
or consent- that it might be very
difficult for a landlord
within the
time
allowed for the
distress to put himself in a position
to prove the privity
to the fraud
of the
person
actually in possession of the
goods ,
and
that if notice were required
the remedy of
the landlord might in practice be entirely
defeated (u ).
IV. An advowson is the perpetual right of presentation
to a church , or ecclesiastical
benefice .
Advowson , advo-
catio, signifies in clientelam recipere, the taking
into pro-
tection
and
therefore
is
synonymous with
patronage ,
patronatus :
and he who
has the right of advowson is
called
the
patron of the church .
For ,
when
lords
of
manors first built churches on their
own
demesnes
, and
appointed
the
tithes of those
manors
to be paid
to the
officiating ministers , which before were given to the clergy
in common (as was formerly mentioned (x) ) , the lord , who
thus built a church , and
endowed it with glebe or land ,
had of common right
a power annexed of
nominating
such
minister
as
he pleased
(provided
he were canoni-
cally qualified ) to officiate in that church of which he was

one word , the

nature of.
This instance of an advowson well illustrates
the nature Incorporeal
of an incorporeal
hereditament .
It is
not
itself
the
bodily possession of the
church
and
its appendages
, but
it is a right to give
another man a title to such
bodily
possession .
The
advowson is the
object
of neither
the
sight nor the touch ; and yet it perpetually
exists in the
mind's
eye , and in contemplation
of law.
It cannot be
delivered from man to man by any visible bodily transfer ,
nor can corporeal
session be had of it. If the patron
takes corporeal possession of the church , the church -yard ,
the glebe , or the like , he intrudes
on another man's
pro-
perty ; for to these the parson has an exclusive right.
The
patronage
can therefore
pass from one owner to another
only by operation of law, or by deed of grant , which is a
kind of invisible
mental transfer : and being
so vested it
lies
dormant
and unnoticed , till
occasion calls it forth ,
when it produces
a visible
corporeal
fruit , by entitling
some
clerk , whom the patron shall please to nominate , to
enter, and
receive
bodily
possession of the lands
and
tenements of the church .

Donative

the advowson
has been once
separated
from the property
of the manor by legal conveyance
, it is called an advowson
in gross ,
or at large , and never can
be appendant
any
more ; but is for the future annexed to the
person of its
owner , and not to his manor or lands (c) , unless
indeed
the
separation
was only of a temporary
character ,
as if
made by a person having
only a partial
interest
(as for
years
or for life ) in the
manor ,
or being
made by the
owner in fee is only for a term of years or for life (d).
An
advowson may however be conveyed by a lord of a manor
with part of the land of the manor , without
parting with
the whole manor , in which
case it remains
appendant
to
the land with which it was conveyed, so as to pass by a
subsequent conveyance
of that land although
not named ,
with this exception however , that it
does
not where
the
crown is the grantor (e).
Advowsons are of three kinds- donative , presentative ,
and collative .
It is probable that all were originally of
the
first kind , of which
there
are
now but few .
An
advowson is donative when the patron , whether the king
or a subject , has the right to confer the church and all the
temporalities
by investiture , without
the necessity of any
presentation
to
or institution
by the
bishop .
The
only
restriction
upon the choice of the clerk
is that
he must
have received
ordination (f).

patron
is
under
no
necessity to fill the
church
when
vacant , but he can take the
property to his own use (g).
The
ordinary
has
no jurisdiction
over
the
incumbent
except for personal
offences
(h) .
As might be expected,
the church was greatly dissatisfied with such a condition
of impotence , and great
struggles
were made to abolish
the custom
of investiture
by the
patron
only (i) ; and in
the reign of Henry the
Second the method of institution
by the bishop
appears to have been first practised .
At
length
the practice grew up of presenting
the proposed
clerk
to the bishop ,
previously
to his institution ;
this
would
be
necessary
when the donee of the living was a
layman , and in that
case the bishop
could
exercise the
unquestioned
right of rejecting
him, and by the begin-
ning of the 14th century (k) the Pope and the bishops had
succeeded
in establishing
their power of refusal in most
cases ,
even where
the clerk
was already in holy orders ,
and about the
same time the doctrine of lapse was intro-
duced, entitling the
ordinary
to
collate
a clerk
to the
benefice if the patron
neglected to present one within
six
months
after the vacancy occurred .
So that ultimately ,
in parochial
churches at least , the practice of presentation
to the bishop
became
almost
universal .
Some churches
however
survived
this
innovation , and particularly those
which were closely connected with great family mansions .
In these the bishop or ordinary
is said to have power as
to the parson , but not as to the place (7).
Moreover , some were in later
times created by special
license of the crown ; the few donative
advowsons which
now
remain
are mostly
of this kind (m).

Presentative
advowson.
greater part of all advowsons now belong
to the second
class called
presentative , which , as will appear from what
has been said , are where the patron has a right to present
a clerk to the
bishop ,
and subject to the bishop finding
him canonically
qualified , to require that he be instituted
and inducted into the church .
A donative advowson , not specially created
so by letters
patent , becomes
as the law now stands presentative , if the
patron once waives the peculiar right of investiture
which
he possesses . If he
once presents to the bishop , and his
clerk is admited and instituted , the right of investiture
is
lost (n).
And if a donative
advowson receive augmenta-
tion from
Queen Anne's bounty under the act 1 Geo .
1 ,
st. 2, c.
10 , it
loses
its
special
character and
becomes.
presentative .
Since an advowson may , like land , be held for various
interests of different duration , as for years , or for life , or
for ever, the person who would , if it were land , be entitled
to the
actual
possession of the land,
at the time the
church falls vacant , has the right to present to the church
for that turn ; when the advowson belongs to several per-
sons in common , as for instance coparceners, they present
in turn , the
eldest first ( 0) , if they be joint tenants they
must
concur in
each
presentation , otherwise the bishop
may present.

So that if an advowson be sold when the church
is vacant , the presentation will not
pass,
although
the
sale is good
as to the advowson (q) . If the patron die
whilst the
church is vacant , then , although
the advowson
goes to the heir or devisee , the presentation is considered
as a chattel
and
goes to the personal
representative
(r) ;
if, however , the patron
is himself incumbent , so that the
vacancy is
occasioned by his own death , the presentation
goes to the heir or devisee (s).
An advowson being of a
valuable species of property , may of course be mortgaged ,
but inasmuch
as the presentations
are not matters
that
can be brought
into account , the
mortgagee
is
bound

Collative

Formerly,

institutions , it was ,
as we
have seen (g) , customary for them to appoint vicars to the
churches ; the right of nomination

stituted
another
advowson , which on the dissolution
of
monasteries came into the hands of private individuals ( ).
There is no difference in the law relating

of those vicarages which were before 31 & 32 Vict . c. 117 ,
called perpetual curacies .

VI. Annui-
VI. Annuities are of much the same nature as corodies ,
except that they have their origin in the grant of temporal
persons, whilst the former
are always due from spiritual
incorporations .
We have
already (k)
had
occasion
to
point out
much
of their nature in distinguishing
them
from
rent-charge , with which
they are often confounded ,
the two names being commonly , though inaccurately , used
interchangeably .
The primary requisite to a good annuity
is the fixity of the intervals
at which it is payable .
Thus ,
a covenant with A. and his heirs to find a priest to serve
a
chapel every holyday , or to pay 5l. for every
default , is no
annuity
on account of the uncertainty of the payment (1) .
The
annuity is to be considered
as
consisting
merely of
definite sums payable
at specified
epochs , and
so is dis-
tinguishable
from
payments in
the nature of interest .
Upon this principle , until provision was made by statute
for obviating
the evils attending
the rule (m ) , it was held
that if a man entitled
to an annuity
for his life died the
day before the
day of a payment
becoming
due,
his
executors
could
not
claim
any part of the sum which
would have accrued (n).
The characteristic of an annuity
at common law was that there was a special writ by which
it could
be recovered
(o) ; the modern form
of securing
its payment is by bond or covenant , the action upon which
may be had without
prejudice
to any security which
the
annuitant
may have, which
was not the
case
with the
ancient and now obsolete writ .
As we have said that since
an annuity may be limited to a man and his heirs , it con-
stitutes in some sort
an hereditament , otherwise it has
little about it in common with other
hereditaments .
It
may be put an end to by the grantor
obtaining
his order
of discharge in bankruptcy , the annuitant
having
merely

the right to prove in the bankruptcy
for the value of the
annuity (p).
We may notice that an inflexible
rule seems
to have been established
that
no
claim
for interest
on
arrears of an annuity
is allowed (q).
The
practice
of granting
annuities
is
now
far
less
frequent
than it was in the early part of this century ,
when the rate of interest
which could
be
legally made
payable upon a loan was limited .
At times when transac-
tions of this kind were frequent there were several restric-
tions
imposed
by the
legislature
upon
the
grant of
annuities , and amongst
these it was requisite
to enrol a
memorial
of the annuity in chancery in a prescribed form
within
thirty days
after the
execution of the grant (r) .
The litigation which
arose
out of this was found
to be
greater than the benefit , which the registration
was sup-
posed
to afford , warranted , and accordingly all the
legis-
lative
trammels
in which
annuities
were involved
were
put an end to by a recent
act (s) .
The
only requisite
which
now exists to the validity of an
annuity
when
granted by deed is a registration in the Court of Common
Pleas at Westminster

did not trespass upon royal territories (f) .

sories of land , such as air or water , and except
so far as
controlled
by statutes (g) , it has continued to be the com-
mon law up to the present day (h) .
In the progress of time ,
as husbandry
advanced , wild
animals
were to a considerable extent driven out of lands
which
belonged
to private
persons and were under culti-
vation , into waste lands and woods .
These for the most
part not being held by any person , were deemed
to belong
to the crown ,
and
thus
royal
forests
existed in Saxon
times .
The practice of the first Norman kings of creating
immense forests extending over the lands of private
per-
sons , was a novelty in England , and
as is well known , was
one of the greatest grievances which
the English
people
suffered
as the result of the
conquest.
The
claim was
made by William and
his
successors
to the sole right of
hunting throughout
the realm ( ), and they introduced for
the
purpose of protecting
their
forests
the cruel
laws
called
forest
laws ,
under
which
the
most
barbarous
punishments
were inflicted
for transgressing
against
the
rights so claimed (k) .
The cruel and insupportable
hard-
ships
which
these
forest
laws
created
to the
subject ,
occasioned our
ancestors
to be
as
zealous
for their re-
formation , as for the relaxation of the feudal rigours , and

This

the

swept
away all
ancient
rights
in

respect ,
and
substituted
the
doctrine that the right of pursuing

such
other
animals
as
were
accounted
game,
was
then
assumed
as belonging

Mr. Christian
has, however , pointed
out the im-

the other exactions introduced by the Norman family ; and
accordingly we find the immunities
of carta de forestâ
as
warmly contended for , and extorted from the king with as
much difficulty
, as those of magna carta
itself.
By this
charter , confirmed in parliament (7) , all the lands that had
been
afforested
by Henry II. ,
Richard
I. ,
and
John ,
except
the
proper
demesnes
of the
crown ,
were
dis-
afforested
and
freed from the
forest
laws ,
so far
as
extended to the owners .
They remained however subject.
to that law with respect to the rest of the world , and
acquired the
name
of purlieus
(m).
Many
regulations
were also made by the same statute in reference
to those
royal forests which were allowed
to remain , greatly miti-
gating the rigour of the forest law, particularly
( n ) killing
the king's deer was made no longer
a capital offence ,
but
only punished by a fine , imprisonment
, or abjuration of the
realm .
And by a variety of subsequent statutes , together
with the long acquiescence
of the crown without
exerting
these
laws , this prerogative
is now become no longer
a
grievance to the subject .
They
may be considered
as
never having taken root so as to constitute part of the law
of the land , and to have fallen together with the arbitrary
and tyrannous
power which
first
introduced
and
alone
supported them .
It is
worthy
of
remark
that
the same
king who in
later times
attempted
to establish the absolute irrespon-
sibility of monarchy , also endeavoured
to restore the juris-
diction of courts of Eyre to their former authority .
Courts
were held by the chief justice of Eyre under the direction.
of Charles I. , with a view of re-establishing
the forestal
rights of the crown , but the temper of those times was not
calculated
to permit such a proceeding , and it was aban-
doned (o).

Franchise of

Although,
according
to the
better
opinion , it
may
be held that by law a man might always kill game on his
own land , yet it is without
question that it was an esta-
blished
principle
of law that
animals feræ naturæ while
living could not
be the property of a private
individual
,
and consequently they were considered
to be, if not the
property
of the
crown , still
under
the
special
protec-
tion of the royal
authority (p).
So that
a private
per-
son might not
take measures
to appropriate
them
and
restrain
them
of their
natural
liberty,
in
order
to
increase the
enjoyment which
he might derive from the
chase (2).
The theory we have mentioned , when taken in connec-
tion with the much larger claims to the exclusive right of
sporting
set up by the Norman
kings (who
often
were
well able to make men , outwardly
at all events , respect
their
pretensions ) ,
seems
sufficient

It is
unquestionable
that they have been granted from the time

as might be expected

upon the idea that
without such
a grant
the rights of a subject to sporting
would be of small value (r).

assumed royal right to devote a certain
territory
to the
keeping of wild beasts
and fowls of forest , with the liberty
of freely hunting
and killing them , together with the right
of protecting it by the aid of the forest law.
There
have
been several cases where forests have been thus granted to
lords ( s) .
But commonly , when
royal forests have
been
granted to subjects , the grant
has not included
the juris-
diction of forest law, in which
case the forest in no respect
differs from
a
chase , and trespassers must be proceeded
against at common law (t).
Beasts of forest are specially
hart , hind , boar , wolf, and hare , but all beasts
of venery
are
equally

a particular
district , with the
exclusive

in all
respects , except that there are no laws peculiar
to
it.
Beasts of chase
are buck, doe, fox , martin , and roe ;
the property of these is in the owner of the chase . A chase
when belonging
to a subject , must
have been created by
royal grant.
But except in the early times of the Norman
kings , a chase could not be created even by the sovereign
over lands of a subject (u).
A park is an inclosed

To constitute

sites ,
a grant from
the

beasts
of

and if any of these be
wanting , it is no park.
By the statute Westminster

A free warren
is a franchise to have and keep certain
wild beasts and fowls within the limits of a specified dis-
trict, commonly
those
of a manor ( ).
The
owner of a
free warren has an exclusive power of killing game , so far
as his warren
extends, and also of preserving the game
by the
medium
of gamekeepers
or warreners ,
who
are
justified
in destroying
any dogs or other animals
which
injure the game (a).
It does
not
seem that the crown
ever claimed
the right of granting
free warren to a man
over the lands of another (b) , but merely the right over
his own lands .
A man might have a free warren over the
lands of another ; if, for instance , a lord of a manor
had
free warren
over the whole
lands
of the
manor
before
there were any freeholders , on the creation of their estates
he might retain
the warren (c) , or on a common
convey-
ance of land a man might reserve
the free warren (d) .
The beasts of warren
are hares and rabbits , the fowls
are pheasants and partridges (e) .

fishery.
A free fishery or exclusive right of fishing in a public , Free
i. e. a navigable (g) river, or an arm ofthe sea (h) , is also a
royal franchise , which is , like other franchises when vested
in
a private
person , held
under a grant from the crown
either
express , or, when prescribed
for , presumed .
The
claim of royalty to this right seems
to have been admitted
in all countries where the feudal polity has prevailed ( ),
and was probably introduced into England by the Normans .
The making grants of this right was prohibited
for the
future by king John's Magna Charta , and the rivers that
had been fenced in his time were directed to be laid open ,
as well as the forests to be disafforested ( ).
This open-
ing was extended by the second (7) and third (m) charters
of Henry III. to all rivers that were not in defence in the
time of Henry II. , and the defence
of these was limited
to the extent that existed in his time ;
so that a franchise
of free fishery must
be
at least
as
old
as the reign
of
Henry II. (n) . It is to be observed that a navigable river

is
a public highway ,
and
this
is the primary
character
which it bears, consequently the right of the crown and of
those claiming
under the crown
is subject to the public
right of passage (o) , and so also the general right of fish-
ing in a public river common to all subjects of the realm ,
must therefore be exercised only in such a manner as will
not prejudice the right of passage
when the latter right is
used in a reasonable manner (p) .
The
franchise
of free fishery seems
to be such
as we
have described :
but the word
free fishery has not
been
confined to fishing in public waters
and much discussion
has
taken
place
concerning it.
It is
certain
that the
rights and distinctions
of free fishery , several fishery , and
common of piscary , have been much confounded in our law
books .
C.-J. Holt distinguished
them by saying
that he
that had a several fishery must also
be
(or at least derive
his right
from ) the
owner of the soil ,
which
was
not
requisite with
a free fishery ( 9 ) , and next that the owner
of a free fishery has an exclusive
right even against
the
owner of a soil , which was not
the case with common of
piscary (r) . If in the learned judge's distinction
between a
free and a several fishery , he intends that a several fishery
must have
been created by grant express or presumed
from the owner of the soil , this is probably correct .

species of right usually included amongst VIII.offices .
incorporeal hereditaments are certain offices .
An office is
a right to exercise a public
or private employment , and to
take the fees and emoluments
belonging to it.
They are
either public or private ; the former are those which
con-
cern the general administration
of justice , and the govern-
ment
of the kingdom
or the
collection
of the
public
revenues , such as the judges of the courts of law or equity ,
the sheriffs or coroners of counties , the commissioners
of
inland revenue .
The latter are those which relate to par-
ticular districts
belonging
to private
individuals
, such
as
stewards and bailiffs
of manors .
It is perhaps scarcely
accurate
to describe an office as a property , because
even
in the cases of those which
are practically
sinecures there
are duties
which
are
supposed
to
be performed by the
holders , the refusal
to perform which would
cause
a for-
feiture (r) ; yet inasmuch
as the
tenure of
many
offices
closely resembles
and is connected with that
of land (8) ,
a man may have an
estate in them either to him for life
or to him and his heirs , or even for a term of years .
Thus
the office of Lord High Chamberlain
is an hereditary
office
held by the heirs of John de Vere , earl of Oxford .
That
of Earl Marshal is now held by the
duke of Norfolk in
fee.
By far the greater
number , however , of offices
are
held for life .
Offices
are also to be distinguished
into
two
classes ,
according to the
nature of the duties to be performed by
the holders .
One
class is
judicial
requiring

offices of this
class
cannot be granted
otherwise
than for
life , lest
they
should
vest
in the representatives of the
grantee (t) ;
and ,
moreover ,
they
cannot
generally
be
granted in reversion , because , although
at the time of the
grant the grantee may be capable of performing
the duties
of the
office ,
yet before the reversion
should fall
in
he
might become incapable (u) , though it seems that in some
cases where there has been a custom and usage to grant
a judicial office in reversion
such
a grant may be sup-
ported (x).
Offices ofthe second
class are called ministerial
, requir-
ing nothing
more than ordinary diligence and skill for the
fulfilment of their duties .
The law permits
offices of the
latter kind to be dealt with very much like property (y) ,
since the duties may be discharged by deputy (2).
Those
offices which are of a real nature , i. e. concern land , and
are grantable
in fee simple , may be entailed
within the
statute de donis (a) , because
they fall within the meaning
of the word " tenement " (b).
They
may
be held by a
woman (c), and consequently by a tenant by the curtesey (d) .

enacted
that all

CHAPTER

THE
FEUDAL
SYSTEM .
A STUDENT
of our constitution
, who wished
to form a
clear conception of the progress which it has made during
the last eight centuries , would find it difficult to compre-
hend many of its features , unless he were acquainted with
the
nature
of
the
feudal
system ,
a polity
which
in
connected
England , if possible , more than in other parts of Europe ,
has
pervaded
and
influenced
the
institutions
of the
country .
A student
of the English law relating
to the
possession of land , would
find it impossible
to under-
stand the principles
upon which
the structure rests with-
out this previous
knowledge (a).
A brief account of the
feudal system
therefore , naturally
finds
a place in
these
commentaries
before entering further into the law of real
property .
At the same time , it is also observable that the tendency
of modern
thought
is to
disregard
historical
facts
as
grounds
upon which to rest the foundation
of law.
The
mind of the modern law-giver has lately been and is now
solely intent
upon
the consideration
of what
is best for
society as now constituted , and as it promises in future
to

become

Many changes
,
therefore
,
have
been brought
now rapidly about
,
and
more
are
even
now
impending
,
which
bear
such
a
revolutionary
character
,
especially with
reference
to
the possession and transmission
of
landed
property
,

it

we shall do well
in

the origin

to
bear
in

history
of
those
parts
of
Europe
where
it
arose
,
which
,
speaking
generally
,
were
the
countries
subject
to
the
dominion
of
Charlemagne

First
,
we may remark
that although
the

of
Gaul were not entirely dispossessed
of
their property upon
the invasion
of
the barbaric
nations
of
Germany

,
soon
after the
establishment of the Merovingian
dynasty
they seem
to
have
in
individual
instances
been
admitted

high offices

to
retain their own laws

still the feudal

THE FEUDAL
SYSTEM .
Allodial
lands.
the wild forests of Germany .
Originally these German
races attached little importance
to the possession of land ,
and the idea of permanent ownership by individuals
was
one strange to their minds (e) .
This might
easily be the
case where arable land was scarce , and the country for the
most part a wilderness of forests .
At the same time , it is
also to be observed , that during the period succeeding the
time of Tacitus ,
and prior to the invasion of Gaul by
Clovis , they must have acquired some
more settled prin-
ciples of property , because
either before or soon after that
event we find the Salic
laws , which
contain
a
series
of
rules of property , including those of succession
, well esta-
blished .
It is clear that when they took possession of the
fertile
regions
which
they had
conquered
they
formed
permanent settlements , and for that purpose made a par-
tition of the lands amongst
themselves , leaving a portion
to
those
prior
inhabitants
whom
they
found
in
pos-
session (ƒ).
The
lands
so acquired
by the
Franks
(with
whose
occupation , alone , we now have
to do) were what were
termed allodial (g) , a description which in later times was
opposed to feudal or beneficiary , meaning that they were

(g) Allodium is
usually
derived
from the words all and odh, property
[Du Cange , voc . sors. ; Pontoppidan
,
History of Norway,
290,
et alii ].
M. Guizot
derives it from
loos, lot,
on the assumption
that a partition
was
made of the
lands
in
some
regular
way
by which they were
allotted .
That
there
was
some
principle
of allotment
seems clear
from the story of the vase of Sois-
sons
(1 Hall .
155), where
Clovis
having, on the occasion of distribu-
tion of plunder , begged for himself
a precious
vessel belonging
to the
church
of Rheims ,
a soldier , con-
trary it would seem to the general
wishes
of
the
army ,
exclaimed ,
striking the vase with his
battle-
axe, " you
shall
have nothing here
but what falls to your lot."


ITS GROWTH .

possessed
in absolute
ownership , subject
to no
burden
except the performance of the
universal
duty of public
defence .
They
passed
to the
children
equally ,
or
on
failure of children , to the nearest kindred ( ) .
From this
descendible quality the word
allodial
was
afterwards
not
uncommonly
used
synonymously
with heritable (i) .
In
the general
distribution
of lands , moreover , a very con-
siderable
share was reserved for the
maintenance of the
dignity of the crown .
These lands , called the fiscal lands ,
were dispersed over different
parts of the kingdom , and
formed the only regular source of revenue which
in those
times the sovereigns possessed .
This original absolute ownership of large tracts of land
by the crown is a fact of the highest
importance , for from
it depended a chain of consequences
, which
ended
in the
feudal
system .
It is obvious that when nearly the only
kind of wealth which existed was land and its immediate
products , the only rewards for past services and present
fidelity which
could be given by a monarch to his fol-
lowers would
consist in grants of land
to be enjoyed by
the grantee for such period as might be determined upon .
And this in fact
seems
to have been the practice .
The
demesne
lands of the crown , or the fisc , were granted under Benefices,
the title of benefices
to favoured
subjects , or
subjects
whose
fidelity it was of importance
to secure , upon
con-
ditions
creating
a close relationship
between the grantee
and his lord ( ).
Originally they were in general granted

Sub-infeu-

only for life , but in very early times they became heredi-
tary , capable of being enjoyed in succession, so long as the
conditions of their tenure were observed.
Of these con-
ditions
there
can be little
doubt
that an oath of fidelity
and the render of military service
constituted
the most
important .
When grants from the
crown
made in this
manner
became
common , there naturally
arose the custom of the
great
lords who owned
large
territories , either allodially
or as hereditary
benefices , granting
portions of their
land
to others to be held of themselves upon a like species of
tenure .
Even in the
days of Pepin
and
Charlemagne
(A. D. 750-800
circ .) this process
of sub -infeudation
was
practised .
At a later period it became universal .
Indeed
the constant private wars which existed rendered it of the
same importance
to a powerful baron ,
as
to the crown
itself , to have
attached
to him by a connection of more
enduring
kind than
mere personal
affection , a body of
retainers
ready to take arms at his word
and follow him
to the field . " Out of these ancient grants , now become for
the
most part hereditary , there grew up in the
tenth
century , both in name and reality, the system of feudal
tenures ()."
But , besides the land so held by grant from the crown
and by sub-infeudations , there was, as we have
seen , a
large
portion
held independently
or allodially.
This , in
the course of time , became
changed into feudal
holdings
by pressure of circumstances .
The history of the period
succeeding the establishment
of the Frankish
empire ,
contains
little
but
a
series of continual
struggles
for
power between not only those who claimed succession
to a

throne, but
those who with no better right than
that of
personal
energy
and
territorial
power ,
endeavoured
to
establish themselves in sovereign independence and with
absolute dominion over their possessions.
The Chronicles
are full of wars
internal
and
external ,
murders
and
outrages
of every kind (m ).
We find the kings of the
Merovingian
dynasty
gradually
losing
their
power
by
subdivision amongst themselves ,
by personal
incapacity ,
by the encroachments of their own great officers of state ,
until ,
after
passing
through
the
phase of
being
mere
puppets , they are finally overthrown
by a new
dynasty .
This ,
under
Charlemagne ,
attains
a
high
degree of
despotic
authority
only
to
be
degraded
under
his
successors
to the
same
or
even a more
abject
state
of
prostration .
Such
was the
condition
of society ,
and
in
such
circumstances it was but natural
that the assump-
tion of despotic
power
over
others should
not
be
con-
fined
to the
central
authority .
Provincial
governors ,
the
counts (n ) , the
dukes , and
other
nobles
generally ,
constantly aimed at more
or less
absolute
control
over
all with whom they
came in contact .
Thus
it was in-
evitable
that some dependency upon their powerful neigh-
bours
would
arise
on the
part of all
allodial
proprie-
tors of only
moderate
means.
And
remembering
the
subdivision of lands which took place on the death of each
(m) "It is a weary
and
unpro-
fitable task to follow these changes
in detail
through
scenes of tumult
and bloodshed
in which the
eye
meets with
no
sunshine ,
nor
can
rest upon any interesting
spot . It
would be difficult , as Gibbon justly
said, to find anywhere
more
vice
or less virtue ."

owner , we see that allodial
lands must be possessed
prin-
cipally
in
continually
diminishing
quantities .
Their
possessors
, therefore ,
must
chiefly
have been
placed in
circumstances which in peaceful times would render them
industrious
and happy yeomen , but, in the times of which
we speak, little
capable of effectually resisting
the power
arising
from the
combined
resources of
a baron's
pos-
sessions .
These,
therefore , " who
had
hitherto
formed
the
strength
of the
state fell
into
a much worse condition .
They were exposed to the rapacity of the counts , who ,
whether
as
magistrates
or governors , or as
overbearing
lords ,
had it
always
in their
power
to harass
them .
Every district
was exposed to continual hostilities
; some-
times from a foreign country , more often from the owners
of castles and fastnesses
, which in the tenth century , under
pretence of resisting
Normans and Hungarians
, served the
purposes of private wars .
Against such a system of rapine
the military
compact of lord and vassal was
the
only
effectual shield : its essence was the reciprocity of service
and protection .
An insulated
allodialist
had no support ,
his fortunes were strangely changed
since he claimed
at
least in right a share in the legislation of his country , and
could compare with pride
his patrimonial
fields with the
temporary benefices
of the crown .
Without law to redress
his injuries , without
the royal power to support his right ,
he had no course left but to compromise with oppression
and
subject himself in return
for protection
to a feudal

in

in
the celebrated

allodial
,
over
which the king's
officer
or

afterwards called

,
had juris-
diction
,
was
called

not seem to have been

effected
immediately
after the conquest , nor by the mere
arbitrary will and power of the Conqueror
; but to have
been gradually
established
by the Norman
barons , and
others, in such forfeited
lands as they received from the
gift of the Conqueror , and afterwards universally
consented
to by the great council of the nation long
after
his title
was
established .
Indeed ,
from
the
slaughter
of the
English nobility at the battle of Hastings , and the fruit-
less insurrection
of those who
survived , such numerous
forfeitures
had
accrued
,
that he was
able to reward
his
Norman
followers with very large
and extensive
posses-
sions .
The monkish
historians ,
and
such
as
have im-
plicitly followed
them , have represented him as
having
by right of the sword seized on all the lands of England ,
and dealt them
out again to his own
favourites .
This
supposition , grounded
upon a mistaken
sense of the word
conquest,
which , in its feudal
acceptation ,
signifies
no
more than
acquisition , has led many
hasty writers
into
the belief, which upon examination
is found to be untrue ,
that all Saxon
proprietors
were dispossessed
by the Nor-
mans , or at least were allowed to retain their land only by
new and special grant .
However , certain it is,
that the

England ; and their regard for the feudal law under which
they had long lived , together with the king's recommen-
dation of his policy to the English , as the best way to put
themselves
on a military footing ,
and thereby to prevent
any future attempts from the continent , were probably the
reasons that prevailed to effect
its establishment
here by
law.
And , though
the time of this great
revolution
in
the tenure of land
cannot
be ascertained with exactness
,
yet there are circumstances
that
lead
us to a probable
conjecture
concerning
it.
For we learn
from the Saxon
Chronicle (r) , that in the
nineteenth
year of king Wil-
liam's reign an invasion was apprehended from Denmark
;
and the military constitution
of the Saxons
being
then
laid aside , and no other introduced in its stead , the king-
dom was wholly defenceless ; which occasioned the king
to bring over a large army of Normans
and Bretons , who
were quartered
upon
every landholder ,
and greatly
op-
pressed the people.
This
apparent
weakness ,
together
with the grievances
occasioned
by a foreign
force , might
co -operate with the king's remonstrances , and the better
incline the nobility to listen
to his proposals for putting
them in a posture of defence .
For , as soon as the danger
was over, the king held a great council to inquire into the
state of the nation (s) ; the immediate
consequence
of
which was the compiling
of the great survey called domes-
day-book (1) , which was finished in the next year : and in
(r) A.D.
1085.

126
THE FEUDAL
SYSTEM .
the latter end of that very year the king was attended by
all his nobility at
Sarum ; where all the principal
land-
holders
submitted
their
lands
to the
yoke of military
tenure , became
the king's vassals , and did
homage and
fealty to his person ( ).
This may possibly
have been
the era of formally
introducing
the feudal tenures by law ;
and perhaps the very law, thus
made at the
council
of
Sarum , is that which
is still
extant (x) , and couched in
these
remarkable
words : " Statuimus ,
ut
omnes
liberi
homines fædere
et
sacramento
affirment,
quod intra
et
extra
universum
regnum
Anglice
Wilhelmo
regi
domino

esse
volunt ;
terras
et
honores illius
omni
fidelitate
ubique
servare
cum
eo,
et
contra
inimicos
et
alienigenas
defendere ."
The
terms
of
this
law
(as
sir Martin Wright
has observed (y) )
are plainly feudal
:
for , first, it requires
the
oath
of
fealty ,
which
made
in the
sense
of the
feudists
every man
that
took it a
tenant or vassal : and , secondly , the tenants obliged them-
selves to defend their lord's territories and titles against all
enemies foreign and domestic .
But what
clearly evinces
the legal establishment
of this system , is another law of
the same collection (~), which exacts the performance ofthe
military feudal services, as ordained by the general council .

The feudal system thus became established
throughout
the whole realm .
Its acceptance was in appearance vo-
luntary , or with
the consent of a great
council
; but
we
may easily suppose that the act was voluntary
only on the
part of those Norman
barons who were not only united in
interest with the king , but accustomed in their own earlier
history to the great military polity.
To them the adoption
of this system of tenure was at once a cause and a conse-
quence
of their power .
By
accepting
grants
from
the
king they
acquired
territorial
wealth ,
and
consequent
personal
power ;
by insisting upon
the
acceptance
by
others
of fiefs held
under
themselves
they insured
their
own safety and that of their society as then
established .
The conversion of allodial
property into feuds , although it
had never been done in the wholesale
way in
which it
was then effected
in England , had been
sufficiently
com-
mon in France
and other countries to make its
adoption.

as the
least of many evils to those upon whom it was forced (a) .

doctrines
which prevailed
in the

also such fruits and

to the bounty of
their sovereign lord .
Our ancestors therefore , who were by no means bene-
enforcedby ficiaries , but had barely consented to this fiction of tenure
from the crown , as the basis of a military discipline , with
reason looked
upon
these
deductions
as grievous imposi-
tions , and arbitrary
conclusions from principles
that , as to
them ,
had
no foundation
in truth (d).
However ,
this
king , and his
son William
Rufus , kept
up with
a high
hand all the rigours of the feudal doctrines : but their suc-
Relaxed by
cessor , Henry I. , found it expedient , when he set up his
pretensions to the crown , to promise
a restitution of the
laws
of king
Edward
the
Confessor ,
or
ancient
Saxon
system ; and accordingly , in the first year of his reign ,
granted
a
charter (e), whereby
he
gave up the greater
grievances , but still reserved the fiction of feudal tenure ,
for the same military purposes which induced his father
to introduce it.
But this charter was gradually
broken
through ,
and the former
grievances
were
revived
and
aggravated , by himself and succeeding princes ; till , in
the reign of king John , they became
so intolerable , that
they occasioned his barons , or principal
feudatories , to rise
up in arms against
him ; which
at length
produced
the
famous great charter
at Runingmead
, which , with some
alterations , was confirmed by his son Henry III .
And ,
though
its immunities
(especially
as altered
on its last
edition by his
son) (ƒ)
are
very greatly
short of those
granted by Henry I. , it was justly
esteemed
at the time
a vast acquisition

are not
(as some arbitrary
writers
would
represent them)
mere
infringements
of the
king's prerogative ,
extorted
from our princes
by taking
advantage of their weakness ;
but a restoration of that ancient constitution , of which our
ancestors
had been defrauded by the art and finesse of the
Norman lawyers , rather than deprived by the force of the
Norman arms (g).
33
(g) " It has been very common ,'
says Mr.
Hallam
(History of the
Middle
Ages ,
ch. 2, part
2), " to
seek for the origin
of feuds , or at
least for analogies
to them, in the
histories of various
countries .
But
though it is of great importance
to
trace the
similarity of customs
in
different
parts
of
the
world ,
be-
cause it guides
us to the
discovery
of general
theorems
as to human
society, yet we
should
be
on our
guard against
seeming
analogies ,
which vanish
away when
they
are
closely observed .
It is easy to find
partial resemblances
to the feudal
system.
The
relation
of
patron
and client
in the Roman
republic
is not unlike that of lord and vassal
in respect of mutual
fidelity ; but
it was not
founded
on the tenure
of land or on military service .
The
veteran soldier , and, in later times ,
some barbarian
allies of the
empe-
rors, received lands upon
condition
of public
defence ; but they were
bound not to an individual
lord,
but to the
state .
Such
a resem-
blance to fiefs may be found in the
VOL. II.
Zemindaries
of Hindostan
and the
Timariots of Turkey .
The clans of
the Highlanders
and Irish followed
their chieftain
into the
field ; but
their
tie
was
that
of
imagined
kindred
and
respect
for
birth, not
the spontaneous
compact
of vassal-
age.
Much less can we extend the
name
of feud ,
though
it is some-
times
strangely
misapplied , to the
polity of Poland
and
Russia .
All
the
Polish
nobles
were
equal
in
rights,
and
independent
of
each
other .
All
who
were
less
than
noble
were in
servitude .
No
go-
vernment
can be more opposite to
the long
gradations
and
mutual
duties
of the
feudal
system .
The
regular
machinery
and
systematic
establishment
of feuds , in fact , may
be considered as almost
confined
to
the dominions
of Charlemagne , and
to those countries
which
afterwards
derived it from thence ."

editions of Mr. Hallam's work ; in
the later editions
it is

amplified .

THE FEUDAL
SYSTEM .
The nature,
doctrine,
pal laws of
feuds,
Having given this
short history of their rise and pro-
gress, we will
next
consider the
nature , doctrines ,
and
principal
laws of feuds ; wherein we shall evidently trace
the groundwork
of many
parts of our public
polity , and
also the origin of such of our own tenures, as were either
abolished in the 17th century , or still remain in force .
The grand and fundamental
maxim of all feudal tenure
and princi-
is this : that all lands were originally granted out by the
sovereign , and
are
therefore holden
either
mediately
or
immediately
of the crown .
The grantor was called the
proprietor , or lord ; being
he who
retained the dominion.
or ultimate
property of the feud or fee : and the grantee ,
who
had
only
the
use and possession according
to the
terms of the grant , was
styled
the feudatory
or vassal ,
himself pointed
out an institution,
which appears
to have
been much
more
closely analogous to the
pro-
per
feud than any of those enume-
rated
above.
" This
was
usually
called
commendation ; and
appears
to have
been founded
on two very
general
principles , both
of which
the distracted
state of society in-
culcated .
The
weak
needed the
protection
of the powerful , and the
government
needed
some
security
for public
order .
Even before the
invasion
of the Franks,
Salvian , a
writer of the fifth century , mentions
the
custom
of obtaining
the pro-
tection of the great by money , and
blames their
rapacity ,
though
he
allows
the
natural
reasonableness
of the
practice .
The
disadvan-
tageous condition
of the less power-
ful
freemen , which
ended
in the
servitude
of one
part , and in the
feudal
vassalage
of
another ,
led
such
as fortunately
still
preserved
their alodial
property
to insure
its
defence by a stipulated
payment of
money .
Such
payments ,
called
Salvamenta , may
be traced
in
ex-
tant
charters ,
chiefly
indeed
of
monasteries .
In the
case of pri-
vate persons , it may be presumed ,
that
this
voluntary
contract
was
frequently changed by the stronger
party into a perfect
feudal
depend-
ence.
From this , however , I ima-
gine it properly differed
in
being
capable of dissolution
at the
infe-
rior's pleasure , without
incurring a
forfeiture , as well as in having
no
relation
to
land .
Homage , how-
ever, seems to have been incident
to
commendation
as well
as
to
vassalage .
Military
service
was
sometimes
the
condition
of this
engagement .
It
was the law of
France , so late at least as the com-
mencement
of
the
third
race
of
kings , that no man could take part
in private
wars , except in defence
of his own lord ; and this is strongly
supported
by the
analogy
of our
own Anglo-Saxon laws , where it is
frequently
repeated , that
no
man
should
continue without a lord."


FEUDAL
CEREMONIES .
131
which was only another name for the tenant
or holder of
the lands ; though on account of the prejudices which we
have justly
conceived
against
the
doctrines
that
were
afterwards grafted
on this system, we now use the word
vassal
opprobriously , as synonymous with slave or bond-
man (h).
The manner of the grant was by words of gra- Grant,
tuitous
and pure
donation , dedi
et
concessi ; which were
long the operative words in the
infeudations
or deeds of
feoffment of more modern times .
This was perfected by
the ceremony of corporal
investiture , or
open
and noto-
rious delivery of possession in the
presence of the other
vassals ; which perpetuated among them the era of the new
acquisition, at a time
when the art of writing was very

derivation
of
this word

which is entirely omitted

Meyer

onewhich

plausible

"The word
gesell,'" he says,
Dutch and
German , signifies
com-

Tacitus ,
we
know,
has
described the first rude appearances
of the relation of lord
and
vassal ,
under the notion of companionship ,
but his terms
comites and comitatus
were necessarily
abandoned for this
purpose when
they became applied ,
which was very early , to
designate
public
officers
and
public
charges ,
the governors
of
districts , and the
districts
themselves .
But it
is
obvious that these must have been
secondary
meanings , that,
before
comes signified
a count , or comitatus
a county , they
must
have
signified
companion
and companionhood , and
we know that the
first counts were
what we should
now call vassals of
the monarch .
When, however , the
secondary meaning
superseded
the
first , it seems not
improbable
that
the original
term might be Latin-
ised into
guasallus

vasallus .”

Servicesof

the lord.
vassal or tenant
upon investiture
did usually
homage to
his lord ; openly and humbly
kneeling , being ungirt , un-
covered, and holding up his hands both
together between
those of the lord , who sate before him
; and there profess-
ing, that " he did become his man , from
that day forth ,
of life and limb and earthly
honour :" and then he re-
ceived a kiss from
his lord ( ).
Which
ceremony was
denominated
homagium ,
or
manhood , by the feudists ,
from the stated form of words , devenio
vester homo (k).
When the tenant had thus professed himself to be the
man of his
superior
or lord , the next
consideration
was
concerning the service , which , as
such , he was
bound
to
render , in recompense for the land that he held .
This, in
pure , proper , and original feuds , was only twofold ;
to
follow,
or do suit to, the lord in his courts in time of
peace
and in his armies or warlike retinue , when neces-
sity called him to the field .
The lord was , in early times ,
the legislator
and judge over all
his
feudatories
therefore the
vassals of the inferior
lords were bound by
(i) Litt . s. 85.
(k) Homagium
per paragium
was
unaccompanied
by any feudal
obli-
gation ,
and
distinguished
from
homagium
legium , which
carried
with it
an
obligation
of fidelity.
The Dukes of Normandy
rendered
only
homagium
per
paragium
to
the Kings of France , and
received
the like
from the
Dukes
of Brit-
tany.
Littleton ,
s. 85, gives
the
following
description
of
homage .
" Homage
is the most
honourable
service , and
most
humble
service
of
reverence
that
a frank-tenant
may
do unto
his
lord .
For when
the tenant
shall make
homage
to
his lord, he shall
be ungirt and his
head uncovered , and his lord
shall
sit,
and the
tenant
shall
kneele
before him on both
his
knees , and
hold
his
hands
jointly
together
and
between the hands of his lord, and
shall
say thus :
I become
your
man from this day forward , of life
and limb and of earthly
worship ,
and
unto you shall be faithful, and
bear
you faith
for
the tenements
that I claim to hold of you , saving
the faith that I owe unto
our sove-
reign
lord the king ; '
and
then
the lord so sitting shall kiss him."
Ss. 86, 87, 88, contain
variations
of
the form of homage
suited
to the
cases of ecclesiastics , and single and
married women .
As to fealty , the
words
of which were
very
similar
to those of homage , see ss. 91, 92,
93, the
ceremony
was
somewhat
less
formal , and
might
be done in
the presence of the lord's steward
or proxy , which was not the
case
with
homage .

the faith owing

speedy and effectual justice
to all the tenants ) , in order ,
as well to answer
such complaints
as might be alleged
against themselves ,
as to form a jury or homage for the
trial of their fellow -tenants : and upon this account , in all
the feudal institutions
, both
here and
on the continent ,
they are distinguished
by the appellation
of the
peers of
the court ; pares
curtis , or pares
curiæ.
In like manner
the barons themselves , or lords
of inferior
districts , were
denominated
peers of the king's court , and were bound to
attend him upon summons , to hear causes of greater conse-
quence in the king's presence, and under the direction
of
his grand justiciary
; till , in many
countries , the power
of that
officer
was
broken
and
distributed
into
other
courts

peers
of the king's court
still
reserving
to themselves
(in almost
every feudal
govern-
ment) the right of appeal from those subordinate
courts
in the last resort .
The military branch
of service con-
sisted in attending

These it
is impossible
to define
or

tary tenure , which
is chiefly to be
considered ,
were in their
nature
uncertain,
and
distinguished
as
such from those incident
to feuds
of an inferior
description . It was
a
breach
of faith to
divulge
the
lord's counsel, to conceal from him

to
witness
and
some-
times to bear
a part in the

THE FEUDAL
SYSTEM .
Modeof
descent.
We have seen
how feuds came to be universally
ex-
tended beyond the life of the first vassal , to his
sons , or
perhaps to such
one of them
as the lord should
name ;
and in this
case
the form of the donation
was
strictly
observed
for if a feud was given to a man and his sons ,
all his sons
succeeded
him in equal portions
: and , as they
died
off , their
shares
reverted
to the lord , and did
not
descend to their
children ,
or
even
to their
surviving
brothers , as not being specified in the donation (n).
But
when
such a feud was given
to a man and his heirs , in
general terms , then
a more extended rule of succession.
took
place ; and when the feudatory
died , his male de-
scendants in infinitum
were admitted
to the
succession.
When any such descendant , who thus had succeeded
, died ,
his
male
descendants
were
also
admitted
in the
first
place ; and in defect of them , such of his male collateral
kindred
as were of the blood or lineage of the first feuda-
tory , but no others .
For this was an unalterable
maxim
in feudal succession , that " none was capable of inheriting
a feud , but such as was of the blood of, that
is , lineally
descended
from , the first feudatory " (o).
And
the de-
scent , being thus
confined to males ,
originally
extended
to all the males alike ; all the sons , without
any distinc-
tion of primogeniture
, succeeding to equal portions of the
father's feud.
But this being found , upon many accounts ,
inconvenient
(particularly , by dividing the
services
, and
during
which
the
tenant
of
a
knight's
fee was
bound
to be in
the field at his own expense .
This
was extended by St. Louis
to sixty
days ,
except
when
the charter
of
infeudation
expressed
a
shorter
period .
But the length
of service
diminished
with
the
quantity
of
land ; for half a knight's
fee, but
twenty
days
were
due ;
for
an
eighth
part , but
five ;
and
when
this was commuted
for
an escuage
or pecuniary
assessment, the same
proportion
was
observed .
Men
turned of sixty, public
magistrates ,
and
of course
women ,
were
free
from
personal
service , but obliged
to send their substitutes
: a failure
in
this
primary
duty
incurred ,
perhaps , strictly a forfeiture
of the
fief ; but it was
usual
for the lord
to inflict an amercement , known
in
England
by the
name of escuage ."

A custom
,
very similar in
effect to subinfeu-
dation
,
was the tenure by frérage
,
which
prevailed
in
many
parts
of
France
.
Primogeniture
,
in
thať
extreme which
our
common
law
has established
,
was
unknown
,I
believe
,
in
every
country
on the
continent
.
The customs of France
found means
to
preserve the dignity
of
families
,
and the indivisibility
of
a
feudal homage
,
without exposing
the younger sons
of
a
gentleman to
absolute
beggary
or
dependence
.
Baronies
,
indeed
,
were not divided
;
but the
eldest
son
was
bound
to
make
a
provision
in
money
,
by way
of
appanage
,
for the other children
,
in
proportion
to
his circumstances
and their
birth
.
As to
inferior
fiefs
,
in
many places
,
an equal
par-
tition
was
made
;
in
others
,
the
eldest took the chief portion
,
gene-
rally two
-
thirds
,
and
received
the
homage of his
brothers for the
re-
maining
part
,
which
they
divided
.
To the lord of whom the fief was
held
,
himself did
homage for the
whole
.
In the early
times
of
the
feudal
policy
,
when
military
ser-
vice
was the
great
object
of
the
relation
between
lord
and
vassal
,
this
,
like all other
subinfeudations
,
was
rather
advantageous
to
the
former
;
for when the homage
of
a
fief was
divided
,
the
service
was
diminished
in
proportion
.
Sup-
pose
,
for example
,
the
obligation
of
military attendance for an entire
manor
to have
been forty days
,
if
that
came
to
be split equally
be-
tween
two
,
each would
owe but
a
service
of
twenty
.
But
if,
instead
of
being
homagers
to
the
same
suzerain
,
one
tenant
held
imme-
diately
of
the other
,
as
every feuda-
tory might summon the aid of his
own vassals
,
the superior
lord would
in fact
obtain
the
service of both
.
Whatever
opposition
,
therefore
,
was
made to the rights
of
subinfeuda-
tion
or
frérage
,
would indicate
a
decay
in
the military character
,
the
living principle
of
feudal
tenure

Explanation
of the words
ANCIENT
ENGLISH
TENURES .
In this chapter we shall take a short view of the ancient
tenures of our English
estates , or the manner in which
lands ,
tenements ,
and hereditaments
might have
been
holden ,
as the same stood in force till the middle of the
last century .
In which we shall easily perceive, that all
the peculiarities , all the seeming and real hardships , that
attended
those
tenures , were to be
accounted for upon
feudal
principles ,
and
no
other ;
being
fruits
of,
and
deduced from , the feudal policy .
All the land of this kingdom is , by the theory of our
tenure, &c. laws , supposed to
have been granted
by , and to be de-
pendent
upon , and
holden of,
some superior
lord ,
in
consideration of certain services
to be rendered to the lord
by the tenant or possessor of this
property .
The thing
holden is therefore styled a tenement , the possessors
thereof
tenants , and the
manner
of their
possession
a
tenure .
King called Moreover , it is supposed to be holden , mediately or im-
mediately , of the king, who is styled the lord
paramount ,
or above all .
Such tenants as held under the king imme-
diately , when they granted out portions of their
lands
to
inferior
persons , became also lords with respect to those
inferior
persons , as they were still tenants with respect to
Mesnelords. the king (a) ;

were called mesne , or middle , lords .
So that if the king
granted a manor to A. , and he granted a part of the land
to B. , B. was said to hold of A. , and A. of the king ; or,
in other words , B. held his lands immediately
of A. , but
mediately
of the king .
The king therefore was styled lord
paramount ; A. was both tenant and lord , or was a mesne
lord : and B. was called
tenant paravail, or the lowest Tenant
tenant ;
being
he who was
supposed to make
avail
or
profit of the land (6) .

were either certain or uncertain .
Free services were such
as were not unbecoming
the
character of a soldier
or a
freeman to perform ; as , to
serve
under
his lord in the
wars, to pay a sum of money , and the like.
Base services
were
such
as were fit only for
peasants or persons of a
servile rank ;
as to plough
the lord's land , to make his
hedges , to carry out his
dung ,
or other
mean employ-
ments.
The
certain
services, whether free or base , were
such as were stinted
in
quantity , and could
not be ex-
ceeded on any pretence ;
as , to pay a stated annual
rent ,
or to plough
such a field for three days.
The uncertain
depended upon unknown
contingencies ; as , to do military
service in person , or pay an assessment in lieu of it when
called
upon ;
or
to wind a horn
whenever
the
Scots
invaded
the
realm ;
which
are
free
services
:
or to do
whatever the lord should command ; which is
a base or
villein service .
From the various
combinations
of these services have
arisen the
four kinds
of lay tenure
which
subsisted
in
England , till the middle of the 17th century ; and three of
which subsist to this day.
Of these Bracton (who wrote
under Henry the Third) seems
to give the
clearest and
most
compendious
account , of any
author
ancient
or
modern (e) ;
of which the
following
is the
outline
or
abstract (f).
" Tenements are of two kinds , frank-tene-
ment and villenage .
And , of frank-tenements , some are
held freely in consideration of homage and knight - service ;
others in free -socage , with the service of fealty only."
And
again (g), " of villenages
some
are pure , and others
privileged .

whether

do whatsoever
is

service. *
The
other kind of villenage
is called villein - socage , held
under
the king ( ) since
the
Norman
conquest ,
and ,
though
a villenage , is of a privileged
sort.
Being tenants
of the king they cannot
be removed from their lands so
long
as they
are willing
and
able
to perform
the
due
services .
Still they do villein
services , but
such
as are
certain
and
determined ."
Of which the sense
seems
to
be as follows : first , where the
service was free but un-
certain , as military service with homage , that tenure was
called
the
tenure in chivalry , per servitium militare , or
by knight - service .
Secondly , where the service was not
only
free , but
also
certain ,
as by fealty only , by rent
and
fealty , &c. , that tenure was called liberum
socagium ,
or free
socage .
These
were the
only
free
holdings
or
tenements ;
the
others
were
villenous
or
servile :
as
thirdly , where the
service was
base in its
nature ,
and
uncertain
as to time and quantity , the tenure was purum
villenagium , absolute or pure villenage .
Lastly , where the
service was base in its nature , but reduced to a certainty ,
this was still villenage , but distinguished
from the
other
by the name of privileged
villenage , villenagium privi-
legiatum ;
or it might be still called
socage
(from the
certainty of its
services ) , but
degraded by their baseness
into the inferior title of villanum
socagium , villein -socage ,
but the tenants held directly
under the king .

TENURES .
honourable
species
of tenure ,
was that by knight - ser-
vice ( ) , called in Latin
servitium
militare ;
and in law-
French chivalry , or service
de chivaler, answering
to the
fief d'haubert of the Normans
(k) , which name is expressly
given it by the Mirrour ( ).
This differed in very few
points , as we shall
presently
see , from
a pure and proper
feud, being
entirely military,
and the
genuine
effect of
the feudal establishment in England .
To make a tenure
by knight- service ,
a determinate
quantity
of land
was
necessary, which was called a knight's fee ,feudum militare ;
the measure of which in 3 Edw. 1. was estimated at twelve
plough -lands (m ) , and its value (though it varied with the
times (n) ) in the reigns of Edward I. and Edward II. (0) was
stated at 207. per annum (p).
And he who held this pro-
portion
of land
(or
a whole fee ) by knight- service , was
(i) Knight -service, having
regard
to etymology , is a tautologous

pression .
Among
the Anglo-Saxons
the vassals of the king were called
Thegns
or Thanes , that is to
say
servants , from Thegnian
(in modern
German Dienen ) to serve ; and they
rendered Thanes by the Latin word
ministri .
So, the knight
(Anglo-
Saxon
enicht) was
the
knecht
or
servant of his superior ; and among
the
Germans
the word
still
has
this meaning only ; their equivalent
for our modern knight being ritter.

every year, if called upon (g) : which
attendance
was his
reditus
or
return , his rent
or
service, for the land he
claimed
to hold. If he held only half a knight's fee, he
was only bound
to attend
twenty days, and so in propor-
tion (r).
And
there
is reason to
apprehend ,
that
this
service was the whole that our ancestors meant to subject
themselves
to ; the other fruits and
consequences
of this
tenure being
fraudulently
superinduced ,
as the regular
(though unforeseen ) appendages of the feudal system .
This tenure of knight -service had
all the marks
of a
strict and regular feud : it was granted by words of pure
donation , dedi
et concessi (s) , and was the tenure which
by operation of law was created when
the king made
a
grant without expressly reserving any particular
service (†) ;
it was
conferred
by investiture
or
delivering
corporal
possession of the land , usually called livery of seisin , the
ceremony
being
perfect
by homage
and
fealty (u).

the strict rigour of the feudal law an absolute forfeiture of
his
estate (y).
Secondly , to make the lord's eldest son a
knight ;
a matter
that was formerly
attended with
great
ceremony, pomp , and expense.
This aid
could
not be
demanded till the heir was fifteen years old , or capable of
bearing arms (2) : the intention of it being to breed up the
eldest son and heir apparent of the seignory to deeds of
arms
and
chivalry , for the better defence
of the nation .
Thirdly , to marry the lord's
eldest daughter , by giving
her
a
suitable
portion :
for
daughters ' portions were in
those days extremely
slender ;
few lords
being
able to
save much out of their income for this purpose ; nor could
they acquire
money by other
means,
being
entirely
de-
voted to matters
of arms ;
nor , by the
nature
of their
tenure , could
they charge
their
lands with this
or any
other incumbrances
(a) .
From bearing their proportion
to these aids no rank or profession was exempted
and
therefore
even the monasteries till the time of their dis-
solution , contributed
to the knighting of their founder's
male heir (of whom their lands were holden ) and the mar-
riage of his female descendants (b) .
But
besides
these ancient
feudal
aids , the tyranny of
lords by degrees
exacted more and more ;
as , aids to pay
the lord's debts , and aids to
enable him to pay aids or
reliefs to his superior lord (c) ; from which last indeed the
king's
tenants
in capite were , from the
nature of their
tenure , excused ,
as they held
immediately
of the king ,

had
no
superior .

John's
magna carta (d) ordained that no aids be taken by
the king without consent of parliament , nor in anywise by
inferior
lords ,
save
only the three
ancient
ones
above
mentioned
.
But
this
provision
was
omitted
in Henry
III.'s
charter ,
and the same oppressions were continued
till the
25 Edw . I. , when the
statute
called
confirmatio
chartarum
was
enacted ;
which in this respect revived
king John's
charter , by ordaining
that
none but the
ancient aids should be taken .
But though the species of
aids
was thus
restrained , yet
the
quantity
of each
aid
remained
arbitrary
and uncertain .
King John's
charter
indeed
ordered , that all aids taken by inferior
lords should
be reasonable (e) ;
and that the aids taken by the king of
his tenants in capite should
be settled by parliament (ƒ) .
But they were never completely ascertained and adjusted
till the statute Westm.
1 , 3 Edw . 1 , c . 36 , which fixed the
aids of inferior
lords at twenty shillings , or the supposed
twentieth part of the annual value of every knight's
fee ,
for making the eldest son a knight , or marrying
the eldest
daughter
and the
same was
done with
regard
to the
king's tenants in capite, by stat. 25 Edw . 3 , stat . 5 , c .
11 .
The other aid, for ransom of the lord's person , being not
in
its
nature
capable
of
any
certainty
,
was therefore
never ascertained

and
therefore
William
the
Conqueror
by his laws (h)
ascertained
the
relief,
by
directing
(in imitation
of the
Danish
heriots ) that a cer-
tain quantity of arms , and habiliments
of war , should
be
paid by the earls , barons , and vavasours respectively
; and
if the latter had no arms , they should pay 100s .
William
Rufus
broke
through
this
composition , and
again de-
manded
arbitrary
uncertain
reliefs ,
as due by the feudal
laws
thereby in effect obliging
every heir to new pur-
chase
or
redeem
his
land ( ) : but his brother
Henry I. ,
by the
charter before
mentioned , restored
his
father's
law ; and ordained , that the relief to be paid
should
be
according
to the law so established , and not an arbitrary
redemption (k).
But
afterwards , when , by an ordinance
in 27 Hen. II. , called the assize of arms , it was provided
that every man's
armour
should
descend to his heir , for
defence
of the realm ; and it thereby became impracticable
to pay these acknowledgments
in arms
according to the
laws
of the
conqueror , the
composition
was universally
accepted
of 100s . for
every knight's
fee ;
as we find it
ever after established ( ).
But it must
be remembered ,
that this relief was only then payable , if the heir
at the
death of his ancestor had attained his full age of one-
and-twenty years (m).

3. Primer seisin was a feudal burthen , only incident
to
the king's tenants in capite ut de coronâ , and not to those
who held of inferior

It was a right which the king had , when
any of his

mediate
possession : and half a year's profits , if the lands
were in reversion expectant on an estate for life (o).
This
seems
to be little more
than
an additional
relief, but
grounded
upon this feudal
reason ; that , by the
ancient
law of feuds , immediately
upon
a death of a vassal the
superior was entitled
to enter and take
seisin or posses-
sion of the land , by way of protection
against
intruders ,
till the heir appeared
to claim it, and receive investiture
:
during which
interval the lord was entitled
to take the
profits ; and , unless the heir claimed within
a year and
day, it was by the strict law a forfeiture
(p).
This prac-
tice , however , seems not to have long obtained in England ,
if ever, with regard
to tenure under inferior lords ; but,
as to the king's tenures in capite , the prima seisina was
expressly declared , under Henry III. and Edward II. , to
belong to the king by prerogative , in contradistinction
to
other lords (q) .
The king was entitled to enter and receive
the whole profits of the land , till livery was sued ; which
suit being
commonly
made within a year and day next
after the death of the tenant , in pursuance of the strict
feudal rule, therefore the king used to take as an average
the first fruits , that is to say, one year's
profits of the
land (r) .
And this afterwards gave a handle to the popes ,
who claimed to be feudal lords of the church , to claim
in
like manner from every clergyman
in England the first
year's profits of his benefice, by way ofprimitiae , or first
fruits .
ship.
4. These payments were only due if the heir was of full 4 Ward-
age ; but if he was under the age of twenty -one , being a
male , or fourteen , being a female (s) , the lord was entitled
to the wardship of the heir , and was called the guardian

custody of the body and lands of such heir , without any
account of the profits , till the age of twenty - one in males ,
and fourteen in females .
For the law supposed
the heir-
male
unable
to
perform
knight- service
till twenty -one :
but
as for the female , she was supposed capable at four-
teen to marry , and then her husband might perform
the
service.
The
lord
therefore had
no wardship , if at the
death of the ancestor the heir -male was of the full age of
twenty -one, or the heir-female of fourteen ;
yet , if she
was then
under
fourteen , and the lord
once
had her in
ward , he might keep her so till
sixteen , by virtue of the
statute of Westm.
1 , 3 Edw.
1 , c. 22, the two additional
years being
given
by the legislature
for no other reason
but to benefit the lord
(u) , but upon the marriage
of the
ward , if above fourteen years, she was entitled to enter .
This wardship , so far as it related to land , though it
was not nor could be part of the law of feuds , when they
were arbitrary , temporary , or for life only ; yet when they
were hereditary , and did consequently often descend
upon
infants , who by reason of their age could neither perform
nor stipulate
for the services of the feud , does
not
seem
upon feudal
principles
to have been unreasonable .
For
the wardship
of the land, or custody of the feud , was
retained by the lord , that he might, out of the profits
thereof , provide a fit person to supply the infant's
services
,
till he should be of age to perform them himself (x) .
And
and
England ,
and ,
perhaps ,
in
some parts of Germany .
By "the
law of France , the custody
of the
land was entrusted
to the next heir ,
and that of the person , as in socage
tenures
among
us, to the nearest
kindred
of that
blood
which
could
not inherit.
By a gross
abuse of
this custom in England , the right
of guardianship
in chivalry , or tem-
porary possession of the lands , was
assigned
over
to
strangers .
This
was one of the most vexatious
parts
of
our
feudal
tenures ,
and
was
never ,
perhaps ,
more
sorely
felt
than in their
last
stage under the
Tudor and Stuart
families ."

if we consider the feud in
its
original import
,
as
a
stipend
,
fee
,
or
reward for actual service
,
it
could not be thought
hard that the lord should withhold
the stipend
,
so
long
as
the service was
suspended
.
Though
undoubtedly
to
our
English
ancestors
,
where such
a
stipendiary
donation was
a
mere supposition
or
figment
,
inasmuch
as
the
lands
were not granted
to
them
,
but the system
of
tenure was
forced upon them
,
it
carried
abundance
of
hardship
;
and
accordingly
it
was
relieved by the charter of Henry
I.
before mentioned
,
which took this custody from
the lord
,
and ordained that the custody
,
both
of
the
land
and the
children
,
should belong
to
the widow
or
next
of
kin
.
But
this noble immunity
did not continue many years
.
The wardship
of
the body
was
a
consequence
of
the
wardship
of
the land
;
for he who enjoyed the infant's
estate was the properest person
to
educate and maintain
him
in
his infancy
:
and also
,
in
a
political
view
,
the lord
was most concerned
to
give his tenant
a
suitable education
,
in
order
to
qualify him the better
to
perform
those ser-
vices which
in
his maturity he was bound
to
render
(y).
When the male heir arrived
to
the age of twenty
-
one
,
or
the heir
-
female
to
that
of
sixteen
,
they might
sue out
their livery
or
ousterlemain
(z)
;
that
is,
the
delivery
of
their lands
out
of
their guardian's
hands
.
For this they
were obliged
to
pay
a
fine
,
namely
,
half
a
year's profits
of
the land
;
though this
seems
expressly contrary
to
magna
carta
(a).
However
,
in
consideration
of
their lands having
been
so
long
in
ward
,
they were excused all reliefs
,
and
the king's tenants also all primer
seisins
(6).

fruits of tenure , and to grant the heir his livery , the itine-
rant justices , or justices in eyre , had it formerly in charge
to make
inquisition
concerning
them by a jury
of the
county (c),
commonly
called
an
inquisitio
post
mortem ;
which was instituted
to inquire (at the death of any man
of fortune ) the value of his estate , the tenure by which it
was holden , and who , and of what
age his heir
was :
thereby to ascertain
the relief and value
of the primer
seisin , or the wardship
and livery
accruing
to the king
thereupon .
A manner of proceeding that came in process
of time to be greatly abused , and at length an intolerable
grievance ; it being
one
of the
principal
accusations
against Empson
and Dudley , the infamous tools of Henry
VII. , that, by colour of false inquisitions
, they compelled
many persons to
sue out livery from the crown , who by
no means were tenants thereunto
(d) .
And afterwards , a
court of wards
and liveries was erected
(e) for conducting
the same inquiries
in a more solemn and legal manner (ƒ) .
When the heir thus came of full age , provided
he held
a knight's fee in capite under the crown , he was to receive
the order of knighthood , and was compellable
to take it
upon him, or else pay a fine to the king .
For , in those
heroical times , no person was qualified
for deeds of arms
and chivalry who had not received this
order , which was
conferred with much preparation and solemnity .
We may
plainly discover the footsteps of a similar custom in what
Tacitus
relates
of the
Germans , who , in order to qualify
their young
men to bear arms , presented them in a full
assembly with a shield
and lance ; which ceremony has
been
supposed
to have

the

restraint and control of the ward's
marriage , especially of
his female ward ; because of their tender years , and the
danger
of
such
female
ward's
intermarrying
with
the
lord's enemy (m ) ; but no tolerable pretence could
be as-
signed why the lord should
have the sale or value of the
marriage .
And as this claim was by no means coexten-
sive with the
establishment of the feudal
system (n) , it
cannot be held as of strictly feudal origin ; the most pro-
bable account of it seeming to be this : by the custom of
France
the lord's
consent was necessary to the marriage
of his female wards (o) .
This was introduced into Eng-
land, together with the rest of the Norman
doctrine of
feuds
and it is likely that the lords usually took money
for such their consent , since, in the often -cited
charter of
Henry I., he engages
for the
future
to take nothing for
his consent ; which also he promises in general
to
give ,
provided such female ward were not married to his enemy .
But this , among
other beneficial
parts of that
charter ,
being disregarded , and guardians
still continuing
to dis-
pose of their wards in a very arbitrary
unequal manner , it
was provided
by king John's
great
charter , that
heirs
should be married without
disparagement , the next of kin
having previous notice of the
contract (p) ;
or , as it was
expressed in the first draught of that
charter , ita mari-
tentur ne disparagentur ,
et per consilium propinquorum
de
consanguinitate sua (q) .
But these provisions
in behalf of
the relations were omitted in the charter of Henry III.:
wherein (r) the clause stands merely thus , " hæredes
ma-
ritentur
absque
disparagatione :"
meaning
certainly , by
hæredes , heirs -female ,
as there
are
no traces before this
to be found of the lord's claiming the marriage

de Unfranville
,

sum equivalent

."
In this
casethe estate must have been large
,
the minor young
,
and the
alliance
honourable
.
For
,
as
Mr. Hargrave
informs us
,
who has well described
this
species
of
guardianship
,
"
the
guardian
in chivalry was
not
ac-
countable
for the
profits
made of
the infant's lands
,
during
the ward-
ship
,
but received them for his own
private
emolument
,
subject
only
to
the bare maintenance
of the infant
.
And this guardianship
,
being deemed
more
an interest
for
the profit
of
the
guardian
,
than
a
trust for the
benefit
of the ward
,
was
saleable
and
transferable
,
like the ordinary
subjects
of
property
,
to
the
best
bidder
;
and
if
not disposed of
,
was
transmissible
to
the lord's personal
representatives
.
Thus the custody
of the infant's
person
,
as
well
as
the care of his
estate
,
might
de-
volve upon the most perfect stranger
to
the infant
;
one
prompted
by
every
pecuniary
motive
to
abuse
the delicate
and
important
trust
of
education
,
without any ties of blood
or
regard
to
counteract
the tempta-
tions of interest
,
or
any
sufficient
authority

knight -service was that of fines due to the lord for every
alienation , whenever
the
tenant
had
occasion
to make
over his land to another .
This depended on the nature
and spirit of the feudal connexion ; it not being reason-
able nor allowed , as we have before seen , that a feudatory
should transfer his lord's gift to another , and substitute
a
new tenant to do the service
in his own stead , without
the
consent of the lord : and,
as
the
feudal
obligation
was
considered
as reciprocal , the lord
also could not alienate
his seignory without
the consent of his tenant , which con-
sent of his was called an attornment .
This restraint
upon
the lords
soon wore away ; that
upon the tenants conti-
nued
longer .
For , when everything
came in process of
time to be bought
and
sold , the
lords would
not grant
a licence to their
tenant , to aliene , without
a fine being
paid ; apprehending that , if it was reasonable for the heir
to pay a fine or relief on the renovation of his paternal
estate, it
was
much
more
reasonable
that
a
stranger
should make the same
acknowledgment
on his
admission
to a newly -purchased
feud .
With us in England , these
fines seem only to have been exacted fromthe king's tenants
in capite, who were never able to aliene without
a licence :
but as to common
persons , they were at liberty , by the
statute of quia emptores
(a)
(if not
earlier ) , to aliene the
whole of their
estate , to be holden of the
same lord
as
they themselves held it of before.
But the king's tenants
in capite, not
being included under the general
words
of
this
statute , could
not aliene without a licence :
for if
they did , it was in ancient
strictness
an
absolute
for-
feiture of the land (6).
But this severity was mitigated
by the statute
1 Edw . 3, c. 12 , which ordained ,
that , in
(a) 18 Edw. 1, c. 1.
There

such case , the lands should
not be forfeited , but a reason-
able fine be paid to the king .
Upon which statute it was
settled , that one -third of the yearly value should be paid for
a licence of alienation ; but if the tenant presumed to aliene
without a licence , a full year's value should be paid (c).

is the
determination
of the
tenure ,
or
dissolution
of the
mutual
bond
between the lord and
tenant , from the
extinction of the blood of the latter by
either natural
or civil means , if he died without
heirs of
his
blood , or if his
blood
was corrupted
and stained by
commission of treason or felony , whereby every inheritable
quality was
entirely
blotted
out
and
abolished (e) .
In
such cases
the land
escheated
or fell back to the lord of
the fee (ƒ) ; that is, the tenure was determined by breach
of the
original
condition
expressed
or
implied
in the
feudal
donation .
In the
one
case ,
there were no heirs
subsisting
of the blood of the first feudatory or purchaser ,
to which heirs
alone the grant of the feud extended ; in
the other , the tenant , by perpetrating
an atrocious crime ,
showed that he was no longer
to be trusted
as a vassal ,
having forgotten
his duty as a subject ; and therefore for-
feited his feud , which
he held under the implied
condition
that
he should
not be a traitor
or a felon .
The conse-
quence of which in both
cases
was , that the gift
being
determined , resulted back to the lord who gave it (g) .

ANCIENT
ENGLISH
TENURES .
Summary of
incidents of
tenure by
knight-
service.
These were the
principal
qualities , fruits , and conse-
quences
of the
tenure by knight-service
:
a tenure , by
which the greatest part of the lands in this kingdom
were
holden , and that principally of the king in capite, till the
middle
of the
seventeenth
century ;
and
which
was
created, as sir Edward Coke expressly testifies (h) , for a
military purpose , viz .
for
defence of the
realm
by the
king's
own principal
subjects , which
was judged
to
be
much better than to trust to hirelings
or foreigners .
The
description
here given
is that of knight- service

There were
also

other
species
of knight -service ;
so
called ,
though improperly , because
the service or render was of a
free and honourable
nature , and equally uncertain
as to
the time of rendering
as that
of knight - service
proper ,
and
because
they were attended with similar
fruits and
consequences
.
Such was the tenure by grand
serjeanty ,
per magnum
servitium , whereby the
tenant
was
bound ,
instead of serving
the king generally
in his wars , to do
some special honorary service to the king in person ;
as to
carry
his banner , his
sword ,
or
the like ;
or to be his
butler , champion , or other officer, at his
coronation
(1).
It was in most other respects
like knight - service
(k) ; only
he was not bound to pay aid ( ) , or escuage (m) ; and , when
tenant by knight -service paid five pounds for a relief on
every knight's
fee ,

other services of the same nature ) a species
of grand
ser-
jeanty (0) if held of the king , and of knight-service if held
ofany other .
These
services , both of chivalry
and grand
serjeanty , Escuage.
were all personal , and uncertain
as
to their quantity
or
duration .
But , the personal attendance in knight- service
growing
troublesome and inconvenient in many
respects,
the tenants found
means of compounding
for it ; by first
sending
others
in their
stead ,
and in
process
of time
making a pecuniary satisfaction to the lords in lieu of it , and
the tenure to which it was incident
was called scutagium
in Latin , or servitium
scuti : and in our
Norman
French ,
escuage .
A tenant by escuage
could , instead of himself personally
serving in war , send a substitute , or pay a compensation
for the
non -performance
of the
military
service (p).
When this kind of tenure became
common , it would seem
that sometimes grants were made with the reservation to
the lord of a tribute of this kind , varying according to the
expenditure which
the lord
had to incur in his own per-
sonal service
to the king (q).
In process of time the
claim
for
escuage
was levied
by royal
authority
at
so
much for a knight's
fee , the
amount
however being un-
certain , like knight - service .
The first time this appears to have been
taken was in
the 5 Hen . II ., on account of his expedition

ANCIENT
ENGLISH
TENURES .
but it soon came to be so universal , that personal
attend-
ance fell quite into disuse.
Hence we find in our ancient
histories , that, from this period , when our kings went to
war , they levied
escuages
or scutages on their
tenants ,
that is , on all the landholders of the kingdom , to defray
their
expenses ,
and to hire troops ;
and
these assess-
ments , in the time of Hen. II. , seem
to have been made
arbitrarily and at
the king's
pleasure .
Which
prero-
gative being
greatly
abused
by his
successors
, it became
matter of national
clamour ; and king John was obliged
to consent by his magna carta , that no scutage should
be
imposed
without
consent of parliament
(r).
But
this
clause was omitted in his son Henry III.'s charter , where
we only find (s) that scutages or escuage
should
be taken
as they were used to be taken in the time of Henry II.:
that is , in a reasonable and moderate manner .
Yet after-
wards by statute 25 Edw .
1 , c. 5 & 6 , and many subse-
quent
statutes (t) , it was again
provided , that the king
should take no aids or tasks but by the common assent of
the
realm : hence it
was
held
in
our
old
books , that
escuage
or scutage could
not be levied but by consent of
parliament
(u) ; such
scutages
being
indeed the ground-
work of all succeeding subsidies , and the land -tax of later
times .
Since , therefore , escuage
differed from knight-service in
nothing, but as a compensation differs from actual service ,
knight -service is
frequently
confounded with it.
And
thus Littleton (x) must be understood , when he tells
us ,
that tenant by homage , fealty , and escuage , was tenant by
knight-service : that is, that this tenure (being subservient
to the military policy of the nation ) was respected (y) as a
tenure in chivalry (~)
But as the actual service was un-

certain , and depended
upon emergencies , so it was neces-
sary that this pecuniary compensation
should
be equally
uncertain ,
and depend on the assessments of the legis-
lature
suited to those emergencies .
For had the escuage
been a settled invariable
sum , payable at certain times , it
had been
neither
more
nor
less than a mere pecuniary
rent ;
and the
tenure , instead
of knight- service , would
have then been of another kind , called socage (a) , of which
we shall speak in the next chapter .
of military
escuage.
For the present we may observe , that by the degene- Corruption
ration
of knight- service ,
or personal military duty , into tenures by
escuage,
or
pecuniary
assessments , all
the
advantages
(either promised
or real) of the feudal
constitution
were
destroyed , and nothing
but the hardships
remained .
In-
stead of forming
a national
militia
composed of barons ,
knights ,
and gentlemen , bound by their
interest , their
honour , and their oaths , to defend their king and country ,
the whole of this system of tenures now tended to nothing
else but
a wretched
means of raising
money to pay an
army of occasional
mercenaries .
In the meantime
the
families of all our nobility and gentry groaned
under the
intolerable
burthens , which
(in consequence of the fiction
adopted after the conquest) were introduced
and laid upon
them by the subtlety and finesse of the Norman
lawyers .
For ,
besides the
scutages to which
they were liable
in
defect of personal attendance , which however were assessed
by themselves in parliament , they might be
called upon
by the king
or lord
paramount
for aids ,
whenever his
eldest son was to be knighted
or his eldest daughter mar-
ried ; not to forget the ransom of his own
person .
The
heir , on the death of his ancestor , if of full
age , was
plundered
of the first
emoluments
arising
from
his in-
heritance , by way of relief and primer
seisin ;
and , if
under
age, of the whole
of his
estate during infancy .

Add to this , the untimely

his poverty
more com-

And

by
these
deductions
his
fortune was so shattered and ruined , that perhaps he was
obliged to sell his patrimony , he had not even that poor
privilege
allowed him, without
paying an exorbitant
fine

A slavery
so
complicated ,

so
extensive
as this ,
called aloud for a remedy in
a nation that boasted of its
freedom .
Palliatives were from time to time applied
by
successive acts of parliament , which assuaged
some tem-
porary
grievances .
Till
at length
king James I. con-
sented
(c) , in
consideration
of
a proper

as to be made in

except
so far
as
regards the merely
honorary

part of the statute , which
destroys
the incidents to tenures by knight's

serjeanty
was the highest
species, is expressed
with a generality
sufficient
to reach
grand serjeanty ; but then a proviso
follows by which the honorary
ser-
vices of this tenure
are
expressly
saved. It is
observable , that the
proviso
for this purpose
is
penned
with an inaccuracy which leads to
a very
mistaken
idea of the

The

quite foreign to grand

From
this

from the confusion

so conspicuous in most parts of the

we
are
inclined
to infer

exists at this
day, but has in a manner
absorbed
and
swallowed up
(since the
statute
of
Charles II. ) almost
every other species of tenure , we are next to proceed.
99
Socage, in its
most
general
and
extensive
signifi-
cation , seems to denote
a tenure by any certain and deter-
minate service.
And in this sense it is by our
ancient
writers constantly put in opposition
to chivalry , or knight-
service, where the render was precarious
and uncertain .
Thus Bracton ( ) ; if a man
holds
by a rent in money ,
without
any
escuage
or serjeanty , " id
tenementum
dici
potest
socagium :
but if you
add
thereto
any
royal
service, or
escuage , to any the
smallest
amount , "illud
dici poterit feodum militare ." So too the author of Fleta (c) ;
" ex donationibus , servitia militaria vel
magnae
serjantiae
non continentibus
,
oritur
nobis
quoddam
nomen
generale ,
quod est socagium ."
Littleton
also (d)
defines
it to be ,
where the tenant holds his tenement of the lord by any
certain
service, in lieu of all other services ; so that they
be not services of chivalry , or knight -service .
And there-
fore afterwards (e) he tells
us,
that
whatsoever
is
not
tenure in chivalry
is tenure in
socage
: in like
manner
it is defined by Finch (f),
as a tenure to be done out of
war .
The
service must
therefore be certain , in order to
denominate it socage ; as to hold by fealty and 20s . rent ;
or , by homage , fealty , and
20s . rent ; or by homage
and
fealty
without
rent ;
or, by fealty
and certain
corporal
service, as ploughing
the lord's
land for three
days ;
or ,
by fealty only without any other service
for all these
are
tenures in socage (g).
:
But socage , as was hinted in the last chapter , is of two
sorts
free-socage , where the services
are not only certain
but honourable ;
and villein -socage , where the services ,
though certain , are of a baser nature .

SOCAGE
TENURE .

former tenure
are called in Glanvil ( ), and other subse-
quent authors , by the name of liberi sokemanni , or tenants
in free -socage .
Of this tenure we are first to speak ; and
this both in the nature of its service, and the enjoyment
of
its
privileges
was always by much the most free and
independent
species
of
any
.
The
word
socage
(i)
has Free socage
,
been derived from the
Saxon
appellation
soc
,
which
sig-
nifies
a
franchise
or
jurisdiction
,
and
being joined
to
a
usual
termination
,
is
called
socage
,
in
Latin
,
socagium
;
signifying thereby
a
free
and
privileged
tenure
.
This
etymology
seems
to
be
much
more just than that
of
our
common
lawyers
in
general
(k),
who derive
it
from
soca
,
an old Latin
word
,
denoting
(
as
they tell
us
)
a
plough
:
for that
in
ancient
time this
socage
tenure
consisted
in
nothing else
but services
of
husbandry
,
which the tenant
was bound
to
do
to
his lord
,
as
to
plough
,
sow
,
or
reap for
him
;
but that
in
process
of
time
,
this service was changed
into an annual rent by consent
of
all parties
,
and that
,
in
memory of its origin
,
it
still retains
the
name of socage
or
plough
-
service
(1).
But this by no means agrees with
what Littleton himself tells
us
(
m),
that
to
hold by fealty
only
,
without paying
any rent
,
is
tenure
in
socage
;
for
here
is
plainly no commutation
for plough
-
service
.
The possession
of
freedom
and the right
of
attending
the feudal
territorial
courts
as
suitors and judges were the
most marked
and valued distinctions
of
the
sokemanni
,
who certainly
were considered
in
ancient times with great
respect

the name of franke ferme ,
as
being "lands

tenements whereof the
nature of the fee is changed by
feoffment
out of chivalry

certain
yearly
services , and

respect
whereof
neither

This, though
not
as we
see
accurate , inasmuch
as these claims might be made , though
in a
different
manner to that in military
tenures , yet
expresses
with
some
truth the freedom of socmen from
many of the oppressive qualities of these demands .
Taking this then
to be the meaning of the
word , it
seems probable
that the socage
tenures were the relics of
Saxon
liberty ; retained
by such
persons
as had neither
forfeited
them to the king , nor
been obliged to exchange
their tenure
for the more
honourable , as it was
called ,
but , at
the
same
time ,
more
burthensome ,
tenure
of
knight-service .
This
is peculiarly remarkable
in
the
tenure which
prevails
in Kent ,
called gavelkind , which
is
generally
acknowledged
to
be
a species of
socage
tenure (p) ; the preservation of which , inviolate
from the
innovations
of the Norman
conqueror , is a fact universally
known .
And those who
thus
preserved
their
liberties
were said to hold in free and common socage .
The
distinguishing
mark of this
species
of tenure
is
the
having
its renders
or
services
ascertained ; it will
therefore
include
under it all other methods of holding
free lands by certain and invariable rents and duties
and ,
in
particular ,
petit
serjeanty, tenure
in
burgage ,
and
gavelkind .
We may
remember
that
by
the statute

grand
serjeanty is not itself totally abolished , but
only
the slavish
appendages belonging
to it : for the honorary
services (such as carrying
the
king's
sword
or banner ,
officiating
as his butler, carver , &c. at the coronation ) are
still preserved .

blance to grand
serjeanty ; for as the
one is a personal
service , so the other is a rent
or render , both tending to
some
purpose relative
to the king's person .
Petit ser-
jeanty ,
as
defined
by Littleton (q) ,
consists
in
holding
lands
of the king
by the
service of rendering
to him
annually
some small implement of war , as a bow , a sword ,
a lance , an arrow , or the like .
This, he says (r) , is but
socage in effect
; for it is no personal service , but a certain
rent
and we may add , it is clearly no predial
service , or
service of the plough , but in all respects
liberum

socagium : only being
held of the king , it is by way of
eminence
dignified with the title of parvum servitium regis,

MODERN

Borough
English .
usually of a rural nature .
A borough , as we have already
seen ,
is
usually
distinguished
from other towns
by the
right of sending members to parliament
; and where the
right
of
election
was,
before
the
reform
of 1832 , by
burgage tenure , that fact alone is a proof of the antiquity
of the borough .
Tenure in burgage therefore , or burgage
tenure , is where houses, or lands which were formerly the
site of houses, in an ancient
borough , are held of some
lord in common
socage , by a certain
established
rent .
And these seem to have withstood
the
shock of the Nor-
man encroachments principally on account of their insig-
nificancy , which made it not worth while to compel them
to an alteration
of tenure ;
as a hundred
of them put
together
would
scarce
have amounted to a knight's
fee.
Besides , the owners of them being
chiefly
artificers
and
persons engaged in trade, could not with any tolerable pro-
priety be put upon such a military establishment
as was in-
volved in the tenure in chivalry .
The free socage , in which
these
tenements are held , seems
to be plainly a remnant
of Saxon liberty ; which may also
account for the great
variety of customs , affecting many of these tenements
so
held in ancient burgage : the principal
and most remark-
able of which is that called
Borough
English ;
so named
in contradistinction
as it were to the
Norman
customs ,
and which is taken notice of by Glanvil (~), and by Little-
ton (a ) ; viz. that the youngest
son , and not the eldest ,
succeeds
to the burgage
tenement
on the
death of his
father (6) .
For which Littleton (c) gives
this reason :
because
the younger
son, by reason of his tender age, is

not so capable as the rest of his brethren to help himself.
Other
authors (d)
have
indeed
given
a
much
stranger
reason for this custom , as if the lord of the fee had an-
ciently
a right of concubinage with his tenant's wife on
her wedding -night ; and that therefore the tenement de-
scended not to the eldest , but the youngest
son , who was
more certainly the offspring of the tenant .
But it is very
doubtful
whether
this custom
ever
existed in England,
though it certainly
did in
Scotland
(under the name of
mercheta or marcheta
) , till abolished by Malcolm III . (e).
Another and not more irrational
account may be derived
from the practice of the Tartars ; among whom , according to
father Duhalde , this custom of descent to the youngest son
also prevails .
That nation is composed
totally of shepherds
and herdsmen ; and the
elder
sons , as
soon as they
are
capable
of leading
a pastoral
life , migrate
from
their
father with a certain allotment of cattle ; and go to seek
a new habitation .
The youngest
son therefore , who con-
tinues latest with the father , is naturally
the heir of his
house , the rest being already provided for .
And thus
we
find that , among many other northern
nations , it was the
custom
for all the sons
but
one
to migrate
from the
father , which
one became
his heir (f) .
So that possibly
this custom , wherever it prevails , may be the remnant of
that pastoral state of our British and German ancestors,
which Cæsar
and Tacitus
describe .

mitted after the conquest till the reign of Henry VIII.;
though in the Saxon times it was allowable
(i) .
A preg-
nant
proof that
these
liberties
of
socage
tenure
were
fragments of Saxon liberty.
Another
species
of
socage
tenure
is that
commonly
called
tenure in gavelkind , or , more properly , tenure in
socage ,
subject
to the custom of
gavelkind
(k).
It is
chiefly found
in Kent , where it
has
prevailed
to
such
an extent that the law presumes that all lands
held for
estates
of inheritance
are so held
subject to the custom ,
unless proof to the contrary be furnished
;
though it was
and is to be found in other parts of the country (7).
It
has
generally
been thought
to have existed
before the
Norman conquest , and to have been retained by the men
of Kent , who ,
as is well
known , succeeded
more than
'most
others in preserving
their
ancient
liberties
and
customs after that event (m).
The distinguishing
proper-
ties of this tenure are various ; some of the principal
are
these :
1.
The
tenant is of age sufficient
to aliene his
estate by the ancient mode of conveyance
called
a feoff-
ment
at the age of fifteen (n ) .
2.
The
estate
does
not
escheat in case of an attainder and execution for felony ;
the maxim
being , " the father
to the bough , the
son to
the plough " (0) ; but this maxim
does not extend to pro-
tect the lands
from
escheat , if the tenant in gavelkind
being
indicted
for
felony
absent
himself
and
is
out-
lawed (p).

a right

so
on in
cases of remoter
col-

which
was indeed
anciently
the
most
usual
course of descent all over England (t) , though in
particular
places
particular
customs
prevailed .
These ,
among
other properties , distinguished
this
tenure in a
most
remarkable
manner : but it
is
only
a
species
of
a socage tenure , modified
by the custom of the country ;
the lands being holden by suit of court and fealty , which
is
a service in
its
nature
certain (u).
We find, by a
charter
of king John (x) , that
Hubert,
archbishop
of
Canterbury , was
authorized
to
exchange the gavelkind
tenures
holden of the
see of Canterbury
into tenures by
knight's -service ; and by

Many
lands in Kent
have been
made by special
acts to descend according
to the rules of

so have been commonly
said to have

known
among the Saxons , although
they
did not form a
part of their military policy , nor
were
drawn
out into
such arbitrary
consequences
as among the Normans . It
seems therefore reasonable to imagine , that socage
tenure
existed in much
the
same state before the
conquest as
after ; that in Kent it was preserved ; and that the rest of
the
socage
tenures
dispersed
through
England
escaped
the general fate of other property , partly out of favour
and affection to their
particular
owners , and partly from
their own insignificancy : for there seems little doubt that
the amount of land held by socage
tenure was for some
time after the conquest inconsiderable
; till by successive
charters of enfranchisement granted to the tenants , which
are
particularly mentioned
by Britton (2) , the
number
and value of lands
so held began to swell so far, as to
make
a distinct , and justly
envied , part of our English
system of tenures .
However
this may be, the tokens of their
original or
forced connection with feudal
laws will evidently
appear
from
a short
comparison
ofthe
incidents
and
conse-
quences of socage
tenure with those of tenure in chivalry :
remarking
their agreement or difference as we go along .
1. In the first place, then , both were held of the king ,
either
immediately ,
or
as
lord
paramount , and
(in the
latter
case ) of
a subject or mesne lord between the king
and the tenant .
2. Both were subject to the feudal return , render , rent ,
or service of some sort or other , which arose from a suppo-
sition of an original grant
from
the lord
to the tenant .
In the military tenure , or more proper feud, this was from
its nature uncertain : in
socage , which was a feud of the
improper
kind , it
was certain , fixed ,
and
determinate
(though
perhaps
nothing
more than
bare fealty ) , and so
continues to this day.
3. Both were, from their constitution , universally
sub-
ject
(over
and
above
all other
renders ) to the oath of

fealty, or mutual bond of obligation
between the lord and
tenant (a) .
Which
oath of fealty
usually
draws
after it
suit to the lord's
court .
And this
oath
every lord , of
whom
tenements
are holden at this day, may call upon
his tenants to take in his court
baron ; Littleton ( b) in-
deed suggests that this ought to be done , because if it be
neglected , it will by long continuance of time grow out of
memory
(as doubtless
frequently
has happened) whether
the land be holden of the lord or not ; and so he may lose
his seignory , and the profit which may accrue to him by
escheats and other contingencies (c).

ancestor was of full
age : but in socage
they
were
due
even though the heir was under
age , because
the lord has
no wardship
over him (g).
The
statute of Charles II.
reserves
the reliefs incident to socage
tenures ; and there-
fore , wherever lands in fee -simple
are holden
by a rent ,
relief is still due of common right upon
the
death of a
tenant (h).
6. Primer
seisin
was
incident
to the king's
socage
tenants in capite, as well as to those by knight - service (?) .
But primer seisins , among the
other feudal
burthens of
tenancy in capite, were entirely abolished by the statute .
7. Wardship is also
incident
to tenure
in socage ; but
of a nature very different
from
that
incident
to knight-
service.
For if
the inheritance
descend to an infant
under
fourteen , the wardship of him
does
not , nor
ever
did belong to the lord of the fee ; because , in this tenure ,
no military or other personal service being required , there
was no occasion for the lord to take the profits , in order to
provide a proper substitute
for the infant tenant ; but his
nearest relation
(to whom the inheritance
cannot descend )
shall be his guardian
in
socage , and have the custody of
his land
and body till he arrives
at the age of fourteen .
The guardian
must be such a one, to whom the inheritance
by no possibility can descend .
At fourteen this wardship
in
socage
ceases ; and the heir may oust the
guardian ,
and call him to account for the rents
and profits
(k) : for
at this
age the law supposes
him capable of choosing
a guardian
for
himself.
It
was in this
particular
of
wardship , as also in that of marriage , and in the certainty
of the render or service, that the
socage
tenures had
so
much the
advantage of the military
ones .
But
as the
wardship
ceased
at fourteen , there was this disadvantage
attending it : that young

Therefore , when
almost all the
lands in the kingdom
were turned
into
socage tenures , the same statute
12 Car . 2 , c . 24 , enacted ,
that it should
be in the power of any father by will to
appoint a guardian , till his
child should attain the age of
twenty -one.
And , if no such appointment
be made, the
court of Chancery will frequently

or advantage to the guardian , but
rather the reverse.
For , ifthe guardian
married his ward
under the age of fourteen , he was bound to account to the
ward for the value of the marriage , even
though he took
nothing
for it, unless he married him to advantage (m).
For , the law in favour of infants
is
always
jealous of
guardians , and therefore in this case it made them account ,
not only for what they did , but
also for what they might,
receive
on the infant's behalf ; lest by some collusion
the
guardian
should have received the value , and not brought
it
to
account :
but the
statute
having
destroyed all
values of marriages , this
doctrine
of course
ceased
with
them.

of
age the
ward might have

his guardian , till the late act for preventing

more at length
presently , in a condition
of bondage now
unknown
in any part of Europe .
These precarious
hold-
ings have become
by lapse of time , notwithstanding
their
mean origin , the
most important
incidents
of a manor ,
being , in fact , no other than
our modern
copyholds , the
arbitrary
power of revocation
originally possessed
by the
lord being
gradually
converted into
the seignorial
rights
which
now exist .
As a natural
accompaniment
of this
villein tenancy ,
there was established in every manor
a
court called the customary court , differing
from the court
baron , though
held
commonly
at the same time ; in this
customary court
the lord or his steward
alone exercised
judicial power.
In many manors
also there was a court
leet, similar in its jurisdiction
to the sheriffs ' court , being
created by the king's charter (r).
In most manors also there was a considerable
portion
of the land
which
was not capable of
culture ,
at
least
according to the state of agriculture
in the early
times.
when
manors
were
created .
This
waste
land the
lord
allowed
his
tenants
generally
to use for
pasture ,
re-
creation , or for roads , as occasion might require , it having
probably been
so used by the inhabitants
immemorially
.
This
permission , like that from which
copyhold
tenure
has sprung , became in
course of time
irrevocable ,
and
thus
arose the
rights
of common of pasture ,
and
other
commons of the present day .
It will be seen from this description
that in order
to
constitute
a manor
there must
exist
on the part of the
lord a power of sub-infeudation
or of granting
lands to be
held of him in fee .
This in the early times of our legal
constitution
was
exercised
without
question
as
to its
legal
foundation .
But more than this , the great barons ,
holding large
territories
under the
crown ,
granted
not
only lands to be held of them in fee
as lords of a manor,
but frequently granted
out of their great manors smaller
manors to be held of themselves , the seignory reserved

(r) Mirr . c. 1, s. 10.

against sub-
them
being
then
frequently
called
an
honour
(s) .
In
imitation
of this, the inferior lords
made similar
sub-
grants , the
process
being
continued
downwards
ad infi-
nitum .
As a consequence
of this method
of sub -infeuda-
tion , the superior
lords
observed
that they
lost all their
feudal
profits
of wardships ,
marriages ,
and
escheats ,
which fell into
the hands of the mesne or middle
lords ,
who were the immediate
superiors of the terre-tenant , or
him who
occupied the land :
and
also that the
mesne
lords
themselves
were so
impoverished ,
that
they were
disabled
from
performing
their
services
to their
own
superiors.
This
occasioned, first,
that
provision
in the Statutes
thirty -second chapter of magna carta , 9 Hen. III.
(which
infeudation.
is not to be found in the first charter
granted
by that
prince, nor in the great charter of king John

But these provi-

the like law
concerning
them is declared by the
statute
of Prerogativa

no tenant of a common lord

Having mentioned

dwell
upon their several peculiarities , with reference to
the present state of things , premising
that manors them-
selves
might be
held
upon
any of the various kinds
of
free tenures which we have described , being
however in
ancient
times
chiefly
held by knight -service ,
and now
since the abolition
of military tenures , with few excep-
tions , in common socage
: and , moreover , a manor
when
in the
hands
of the
king himself, through
escheat
or
otherwise , was not considered as absorbed
in the supreme
lordship of the crown , but continued
in contemplation
of
law to exist .
The demesnes
of a manor being in the absolute disposal
of the lord without
any restriction
arising
from claims of
tenants
of the manor , can be granted
by the
lord
for
years, for life, or in tail, without
affecting the manor (y) ,
though (since the statute Quia emptores ) during the con-
tinuance of such an estate they
cease to be parcel of the
manor . If granted in fee
they are severed
for ever from
the manor , and cannot be reannexed to it,
even if re-
purchased by the lord (2).

Next, as to the free tenemental
lands .
These are now
held in common
socage ,
and only differ
from
ordinary
freehold lands in respect that
the seignory is in the lord
of the manor
instead of the
crown , and
a small
rent is
still often
payable : therefore , in cases of escheat , which
is now the most valuable
quality of such seignory , the
lord of the manor regains possession .
They again become
part of the demesnes
, the tenancy being extinguished in
the seignory (a) .
If, however , the union of the tenancy
and seignory arise from purchase , as if the lord
purchase
the tenemental
lands , they do not
become again part of
the manor , but are severed
from it for ever (b).
If all of the
freehold
lands
become
vested in
one
person , or if the lord purchase
all the
freehold
lands ,
or all but those of one owner , the manor is extinguished .
Because in either
case there
can be no court
baron, for
which , as we have already remarked , two suitors at least
are requisite :
though it would
revive if the
freeholds
after being united in one person should
become separated
again
by alienation
or
otherwise .
In this instance the
law is the same as to purchase and escheat
(c) .
Since ,
however , by a recent act (d) the jurisdiction of the court
baron
has
been
taken away in all
cases
except such
as
relate
to the rights of a widow in her
husband's
lands ,
the legal existence of a manor has become
of small con-
sequence, for we may remark
that manors

guished
or suspended may still remain
manors in repu-
tation
and retain
many of the incidents
which
attached
to them
in
their
perfect
state (e).
In particular
the
jurisdiction
of the lord to hold
customary
courts ,
ac-
cept
surrenders ,
and make
grants
of copyholds , which
is now the most
notable
power
possessed
by the lord,
remains
after the extinction
of the
manor (ƒ) .
By far
the
greater
number of manors
of the present
day
are
but manors by reputation , the instances where freeholds
can be proved to be held of a manor being comparatively
rare .
We come now to the consideration of those parts of the
lands within a manor
which , formerly
held in reality
at
the will of the
lord ,
are now
so
held
only
in
name.
These, though
originally of slight consideration
and not
part of the original
conception of a manor , have
become ,
in England at least , the most common , and , at the same
time , most important
incidents of one (g).
Among
our Anglo - Saxon
ancestors lands
were divided
into two
species ,
called
bocland
and
folcland ,
which ,
though not directly
represented by the freehold and copy-
hold lands of feudal and modern times , were distinguished
from
each other by peculiarities
similar to those which
mark the difference between the latter tenures .
Bocland
was held by book
or charter , and
conveyed
by deed
or
written grant.
It was alienable and devisable at the will
of the proprietor .
Folcland, on the contrary , was held
by a much less certain title.
Originally, land
belonging
to the community
at large
seems
to have been parcelled
out among the common people by some recognised autho-
rity ,
such as the
folcgemot
or
court
of
the
district
;

Bradshaw v. Lambert , 4 T. R. 446 ;

have been by no means uncommon
there .

when
so
distributed ,
the
allottees
held
it
for
such
period
as was fixed by the court , but never in perpetuity .
They were subject to many burthens
and exactions , from
which owners
of bocland
were exempt , particularly
the
obligation
to
render
hospitality
and
afford
means of
travelling
and
maintenance
to the king and great lords
and their followers (h) .
This admitted duty owing to the
state , and
a
forced
submission
to the will of some
par-
ticular powerful lord , would be , not improbably , much the
same in their effects .
A class of people in a state of
servitude would
be equally
incapable of resisting
the de-
mands of one
as the other , and the possession of lands
for
a period
depending
upon
the will of
a
community
would
be very similar in substance to
a tenancy at the
will of the nearest lord.
When the Normans , therefore ,
introduced their system of tenure , they found a class of
inhabitants
not possessed
as of right of any property , nor
even enjoying
freedom of person , but occupying
part of
the land at the
arbitrary
will of others , and on condi-
tion of rendering
menial
and arbitrary
services.
Import-
ing into this state of slavery the feudal notion of faithful
allegiance,
and
the
corresponding
duty
of the lord to
grant personal protection from
the aggressions of all but
himself , we have a near approach to the condition of the
villein () of the 12th century .
In accordance
with the nature
and characteristics of a
manor and the necessities of the
case , the
demesnes
of
the lord were cultivated by his villeins , to whom a portion
of them was assigned for their own subsistence:
Villeins
thus employed were called regardant (k), that is , annexed to
the manor or land . A villein regardant might , however , be

granted
by deed
separately from the land : he then be-
came a villein in gross , that is , annexed to the person of
his lord ( ) , and consequently a man might
be seised of a
villein in gross without relation
to any land .
Villeins in
gross being
considered
as of the nature of land , but not
capable oflivery of seisin , could only be granted by deed (m) .
A villein could not leave his lord without
permission ; and
if he ran away, or was taken away, he might be claimed
and recovered by action , like
beasts or
other
chattels .
They held their little plots of land by way of sustaining
themselves and families ; but it was at the
mere will of
the lord , who might dispossess them whenever he pleased ;
and it was upon villein
services , that is, to
carry
out
dung ,
to hedge
and ditch
the lord's
demesnes
, or any
other the meanest offices
(n ) : and their services
were not
only base , but uncertain both as to their time and quan-
tity (o). A villein could acquire no absolute property either
in lands
or goods :
for if he purchased
either , the lord
might enter upon them , oust the villein , and seize them
to his own use, unless he contrived
to dispose of them
again
before the lord had
seized
them ; for the lord had
then lost his opportunity
(p).
In many places also a fine was payable to the lord , if
the villein presumed to marry his daughter
to
any one

cannot
have any remedy .

without leave from the lord (9) : and , by the common law,
the lord might also bring an action against
the husband
for damages in thus purloining his property (r) .
For the
children of villeins were also in the same state of bondage
with their parents ; whence they
were called , in
Latin ,
nativi , which gave rise
to the female
appellation
of a
villein , who was called a neife (s) .
In case of a marriage
between
a freeman
and a neife , or a villein and a free-
woman ,
the
issue followed
the
condition of the
father ,
being free if he was free, and villein if he was villein (t) ;
contrary to the maxim of the civil law, that partus sequitur
ventrem .
But no bastard could be born a villein , because ,
by another
maxim
of our law, he is nullius filius : and as
he can gain nothing
by inheritance , it were hard
that he
should lose his natural
freedom by it (u) .
The law how-
ever protected the persons of villeins , as the king's sub-
jects , against atrocious injuries of the lord : for an indict-

Gradually
raisedtheir
his
lord ,
and in
others
vesting
in him
an
ownership
entirely
inconsistent
with his
former
state of bondage .
So also if the lord brought
an action against his villein ,
this enfranchised him (b) ; for,
as the lord might have a
short
remedy
against
his villein ,
by seizing
his goods
(which was more than equivalent to any damages
he could
recover) , the law, which
is always
ready to catch at any
thing in favour of liberty , presumed that by bringing this
action
he meant
to set his villein
on the same footing
with himself, and therefore held it
an implied
manumis-
sion .
But in case the lord indicted him for felony , it was
otherwise ; for the lord
could not inflict a capital
punish-
ment
on his villein without
calling in the
assistance of
the law.
By the indulgence
of custom , in some places
villeins
were permitted
to acquire
property
and
so pur-
chase their
freedom (c).
Moreover , it
must
be noticed
that , in England at
least ,
during the period
after
the
Norman
conquest with which
we are now dealing ,
the
villein was only in a state of servitude as against his lord .
As regarded all other men , he possessed
the usual rights
of citizens .
He might acquire and enjoy property with-
out fear of disturbance
: he might sue and be sued (d).
If,
therefore ,
he either by contract , gift ,
or otherwise ,
escaped
from
the
power of his lord , he
became
in all
respects
a free man .
Villeins , by these and many other means , in process of
condition to time gained considerable
ground
on their lords ; and in
copyholders. particular
strengthened the tenure of their estates
to that
degree, that they
came to have in them an interest in
many
places full
as
good , in
others better than
their
lords .
For
the
goodnature
and benevolence
of many
lords of manors having , time out of mind , permitted their
villeins and their children
to enjoy their possessions with-
out
interruption

a
regular

common law, of which custom is the life , now gave them
title to
prescribe
against
their
lords ; and , on
perform-
ance of the same services, to hold their
lands in spite of
any
determination
of the lord's
will .
For , though in
general they
are
still said to hold their
estates
at the
will
of the lord (e) , yet it is
such a will as is
agree-
(e) In some
manors
there
are
found tenements
held according
to
the custom
of the manor , but not
expressed to be
at the will of the
lord .
They
are held
by
copy
of
court -roll , and
are assigned by sur-
render and
admittance
in the cus-
tomary court.
But the tenure
of
them is of a
rather
higher
nature
than
of ordinary
copyholds ,
inas-
much
as
the
inheritable
quality
which
attaches
to
them
does not
depend
upon
custom ,
since
the
lord
may
not
oust
them.
They
are, however , for all purposes at the
present
day
copyholds .
The free-
hold is in the lord, and the right of
the tenant
to the minerals , &c., can
only
exist by custom .

They are sometimes called

Again , there
are some estates held
according to
the custom of a manor , but not by

at the will
of the lord . "These

land

ferred the

standing
all these

cir-
cumstances , it seems to
be
now so
far
settled
in
courts
of law, that
these customary
tenant -right estates
are not freehold , but that they in

able to the custom of the manor ; which customs are pre-
served and evidenced by the rolls of the several manorial
courts in which they are
entered , or kept
on foot by the
constant immemorial
usage
of the
manors in which
the
lands lie .
And , as such tenants
had nothing
to show for
their
estates but these customs , and admissions
in pur-
suance of them , entered on those rolls , or the
copies
of
such entries witnessed by the steward , they now began to
be called
tenants
by copy of court -roll , and their
tenure
itself a copyhold
(ƒ).
Thus copyhold tenures , as sir Edward
Coke observes (g) ,
although very meanly descended
, yet come
of an
ancient
house ; for, from what has been premised , it appears
that
copyholders are in truth no other but villeins , who , by a
long series of
immemorial
encroachments
on the lord ,
have at last established a customary right to those estates ,
which
before were held
absolutely
at the
lord's will (h) .
Which
affords
a very
substantial
reason for the great
variety of customs that prevail
in different
manors , with
regard

to the
descent of the
estates , and the pri-

is in-

to
question
the origin
of
copyholds
: " I cannot help doubt-
ing
(observes
that

whether
this
deduction
is
not
founded in
mistake .
The circum-
stance which
first
led
me to enter-
tain the doubt
is,
that , in
those
parts of Germany from whence the
Saxons
migrated
into
England ,
there exists , at
this day,
a species
of tenure exactly the same with our
copyhold
estates ; and there exists
likewise , at this day ,
a
complete
state of villenage
;
so
that
both
stand
together ,
and
are
not
one
tenure growing
out of another , and
by degrees assuming
its place , & c.
What I have
stated I found in a

accurate
treatise
of
German
law by
Selchow ,
one of the pro-
fessors of the
university
of
Got-
tingen ,
entitled
Elementa

This
seems
sufficient
to negative the
idea that
copyholders
sprang out of villeins .
In England , villenage
has
ceased,
and copyholds
remain ; but here , as
in other
countries , they
both

vailed

vileges belonging to the tenants (2) .
And these encroach-
ments grew to be so universal , that when tenure in ville-
nage was virtually
abolished
(though copyholds were re-
served ) by the statute of Charles II. , there was not a pure Pure villen
villein left in the nation (k) .
For
sir Thomas
Smith ( 1) before
testifies , that in all his time
(and he was secretary to
Edward VI .) he never knew any villein in gross through-
out the realm ; and the
few villeins regardant
that were
then remaining
were such only as had belonged to bishops ,
monasteries , or
other
ecclesiastical
corporations , in the
preceding
times
of popery .
For
he tells
us , that "the
holy fathers , monks , and friars had in their confessions ,
and specially
in their
extreme
and deadly sickness , con-
vinced the laity how dangerous
a practice it was, for one
Christian
man
to hold another in bondage :
so that tem-
poral men, by little and little , by reason of that terror in
their consciences , were glad to manumit
all their villeins .
But the said holy fathers , with the abbots and priors , did
not in like sort by theirs , for they also had
a scruple in
conscience to impoverish
and despoil the church
so much ,
as to manumit
such as were bond to their churches , or to
the manors which the church had gotten ; and so kept their
villeins still ."
By these several means the generality of
villeins in the kingdom have long ago developed
into
copyholders : their persons being
enfranchised by manu-
mission or long acquiescence
: but their
estates , in strict-

ness , remaining
subject to the same servile conditions and
forfeitures
as before.
We may now exhibit the principal
rules
regulating
copyhold tenure as they exist
at the present day , and the
grounds upon which those rules rest.
First , the freehold
or feudal seisin of the land
is in the lord
of the manor ,
the tenant has merely a possessory right by grant
of the
lord , evidenced by his admission .
Therefore the soil , and
everything
deemed
to constitute part of the soil , such as
timber or minerals , belong to the lord (m).
Nevertheless
it must be remarked that this dominion
of the lord may
be qualified by special custom , for by the customs of some
manors the tenants
have the right to dig mines
and cut
timber (n).
But the onus of proving
such a custom lies
upon the tenant claiming it.
And , on the other hand , the
lord, evenwhere entitled to the minerals or timber by virtue
of his ownership , may not come upon the land
to open
mines or cut the wood without the copyholder's
leave .
He
may not even work the minerals
by outstroke , that is by
mining them
through
adjacent
mines (o).
Therefore , in
consequence of this divided power , the existence of copy-
hold tenure is no slight
hindrance
to the full enjoyment
of
all those products
of land which
are
not strictly
agricultural
(p).
Copyholders , with a very few exceptions ( q) , have by
law (as distinguished
from custom , which , however , be it
remembered , is , when proved , recognised and
acted

by courts of law) only an interest in the land , determinable
at the will of the lord .
But their actual beneficial interest
differs
very materially
in different
manors
according
to
the custom .
In most manors
this interest is of as per-
durable
a character
as can be enjoyed in freehold
lands ,
if the
duties
of the
tenant
be
always
duly
observed
.
When this is so , the estates
are called copyholds of inhe-
ritance (r).
In other manors (s) the custom is for the lord to demise
the lands only for the duration
of one or more lives , at
the expiration
of which
period
they revert to him to be
again demised , or, unless there be a custom for renewal ,
which is very common , to be retained by the
lord , if he
pleases , in his own possession
.
Frequently
small rents are
reserved , both
on copyholds of inheritance
and for lives ;
these rents are fixed by the custom from which
the lord
cannot deviate (t).
The lands
must
have
been
demised
or demisable

which
regulate the
descent
of
freehold
lands, as to which
we shall seemore

exists

difficulty
in
ascertaining

heir .

extending

as if a lord holding the manor , pro

or for half
a year , could
by granting
an
ordinary
lease for
years , destroy the copyhold quality
of the land .
But this seems incor-
rect .

These doctrines
are
stated by lord
Coke as follows
: "If a copyhold is
forfeited
to the lord , or escheats, or
otherwise
comes to the lord's hands ,
if the lord make a lease for years or
for life , or other
estate by deed or
without deed , this
land
can
never
after
be
regranted
by
copy , for
the
custom
is discharged , because
during
such
estates the
land
was
not
demised
nor
demisable
by
copy .
So, if the lord makes a feoff-
ment in fee thereof upon condition ,
and afterwards
enters for the condi-
tion broken ,
yet it
can
never
be
regranted
by
copy .
But if the
lord keeps the land in his hands for
a long
time , or
lets it at will , he,
his
heirs
or assigns , may well re-
grant it
at
his
pleasure .
So, if
the interruption is
wrongful , or if
the lord is disseised , and
the
dis-
seisor dies seised, or if the land
is
recovered against
the lord by false
verdict
or erroneous judgment ; in
these cases, till the land is recovered
or the judgment
reversed
by the
lord of the manor , the land was not
demised or demisable , and yet after
the land is recontinued , it is grant-
able
again
by
copy ;
but if the
land
so
forfeited
or
escheated,
before
any
new
grant
made ,
is
extended upon a statute or recogni-
zance acknowledged
by the lord , or
if the wife of the lord in a writ of
dower has this land assigned to her ,
although
these
impediments
are by
acts in law, yet , inasmuch
as the
interruptions
are lawful, the
lands
can never after be granted by copy .
If a copyholder
accepts a lease for
years of the lord of
his copyhold ,
COPYHOLDS .
193
copyhold is assigned to the lord there is a suspension , pro
tanto (y).
In those manors where the heir is entitled by
custom
to succeed to the lands of his ancestor , it is necessary
in order that his title should be complete as against the lord ,
that he should claim the land , and be admitted by the lord
to be his tenant .
Though
as against all others than the
lord the title of the heir is complete without any such
ceremony (2).
quousque.
When the death of a copyholder has been " presented "
or made
known
to the customary
court , the lord
may
thereupon require the heir or other person claiming
title
to the land of which the copyholder died
seised , to come
in and be admitted .
Proclamations
to this
effect
are
made by the lord
at three successive
courts (a) . If after Seizure
the third
proclamation
no such person claims to be ad-
mitted , a precept may be issued by the lord or steward to
seize the lands
into the
lord's
hands pro defectu
tenen-
tis(b).
This seizure
is
not absolute but
is
quousque
,
as
it
is
called
,
that
is
,
until some person claims
admittance
,
unless
indeed
there
is
a
custom to warrant
an absolute
forfeiture
(c),
but meanwhile the lord takes the profits for
his own use
.
This right
of
seizure formerly
was
a
cause
of
much hardship where the persons entitled
to
claim admission
were infants
or
lunatics
or
otherwise incapacitated
to
protect
their own
interest
.
To remedy
this
,
the legislature
has
provided that
a
suitable representative
of
the incapacitated
person may appear and claim admission
on
his behalf
(
d).
the copyhold
is
destroyed
for ever
,
and
can
never
be
granted
again
.
If
the
copyholder
takes
a
lease for
years
of the
manor
,
by that
his
copyhold
has not continuance
;
but
such lessee
may regrant
the
copy-
hold to whom
he will
,
for this land
was always
demised
or
demisable

It is a consequence
of the peculiar mode by which copy-
holders
hold
their lands that the manner of transfer of
lands inter vivos is wholly different from that which
is ap-
plicable to ordinary
freeholders .
The mode of alienation
which has continued to the present day is very similar to
that which obtained in the strict feudal
times

before the right of free alienation
was
established .

death of the former tenant or a surrender by him, there is
commonly
required
by the lord
a payment of a fine .
Fines are in some cases fixed by custom ; in other cases
they are left to the arbitrary will of the lord .
But now
even when arbitrary in name , they are restricted
by the
rules laid
down by courts of common law to two years'
improved value of the land (q).
In addition
to the fines ,
certain fees are usually paid to the steward (r).
In those manors
where the custom is to demise
the
land for lives , the fine is,
as might be
expected
,
often
arbitrary ;
and when the
admission is made for several
lives in succession
, the fine
payable is usually
a full
fine
for
the first life, half that
amount for the
second ,
a
quarter of it for the third , and so
on , so that
the whole
fine
can
never
amount
to
double
two
years '
annual
value (s).
We may notice that if under a will or other settlement
dealing with the copyholds a person is made tenant for life
of the property or with some other similar limited
interest ,
the admission of such tenant for life enures for the benefit
of the remainderman
under the settlement , so
that
no
further
fine is payable after the
death of the tenant
for
life , always
excepting
that
there is
a special
custom
of
the manor providing
otherwise (t).
Where
several persons are entitled

of any

which we shall see more hereafter : any one of them may
demand admission : it would
seem that in this
case the
lord is entitled
to a larger fine than on the admission of a
single tenant (x) .
When the
admission is of several persons as tenants in
common , a single
fine
only is payable , which
is appor-
tioned upon each so admitted (y) .
In
estimating
the
annual
value of the
property , the
quit rents , the expenses
of repairs , and other outgoings of
a like nature , but
not the land tax , must be taken into
account (2) .
The right of the lord to the fine accrues only
on the admittance , after which he may , though not before ,
sue for it in assumpsit (a).
Another exaction
permitted
by the customs
of some Heriots
manors
is that of heriots .
Heriots
which were known to
the
Danes , and probably were introduced
by them , are a
render of the best
beast (b) or other chattel (as may be
the custom which fixes the particular
article ) , to the lord
on the death of a tenant .
They are sometimes
due even
from the free tenants of a manor as well as the
copyhold
tenants (c) .
Frequently
also heriots
are by custom con-
verted into a money payment of fixed
amount (d).
Un-
less by special custom
one heriot
only is
due upon the
admission of joint tenants (e) .
For the latter division of heriots , which is called heriot-
service , and is only a species of rent , the lord may distrain ,

as well as seize , but for heriot -custom (which
Sir Edward
Coke says (ƒ) lies only in prender , and not in render) the
lord may seize the identical
thing itself, but cannot distrain
any other
chattel
for it (g) .
This
speedy
and effectual
remedy
of seizing
is given with regard to many
things
which the lord may in many manors claim
as lying
as it
is said in franchise ; as waifs , wrecks , estrays , deodands ,
and the like ; all which the lord or person entitled thereto
may seize without
the formal
process
of a suit
or
action .
Not that they are debarred of their remedy by action ; but
have also the other and more
speedy
one , for the better
asserting their property ; the thing to be claimed
being
frequently of such a nature as might be out of the reach
of the law before any action could be brought .
Reliefs
are by special
custom
sometimes
incident
to
copyhold tenements , but they are usually
included
in the
fine, or at least commuted by custom into a certain money
payment .
In some
manors
also
there
is
a
special
custom for the lord to have wardship of an infant tenant ,
in which
case he is accountable for the rents and profits ,
like a guardian in socage .
The right
is rarely exercised ,
the duty being
delegated to some relation of the infant
tenant .
It must be remembered , however , that by the
statute of Charles II., ( ) which
abolished military te-
nures , the power of appointing
guardians by will was given.
to a father , and even where the custom above mentioned
exists , it would
seem
that the guardian
appointed by the
father would
at least
have the control
of the person , if
not of the copyhold property of the infant (¿) .
Escheats on failure of heirs and forfeiture
on the felony
or corruption
of blood of the tenant are further
incidents
of this tenure by

moreover the merger of the copyhold tenure in the seignory
takes place even if the lord have only a limited
interest in
the manor (9).
If the lordship
belong to several , as tenants in common
or joint tenants , and one of them purchase copyhold lands
held of the manor , a part of the tenancy , in proportion
to
the
interest
of the
purchaser
in the
manor , is extin-
guished (r) .
If the lord , being tenant in fee , convey the freehold to
the tenant , the land
thenceforth
becomes
in all respects
land
of ordinary
socage
tenure , it is severed
from the
manor , and is enfranchised or made free from every cus-
tomary duty and burden (s).
By the copy hold act before
alluded to (t) power is given either to the tenant or to the
lord to insist upon enfranchisement , and means
are
pro-
vided for effecting this , in cases where the parties
cannot
agree to the terms of enfranchisement
or some of them
are under
disability .
It is obvious that
in the present
day the peculiar nature and incidents
of copyhold tenure
are
a hindrance
to the improvement
of land
and
the
development of its resources
, the policy of the legislature
has
therefore
been to
encourage
as far as
possible its
abolition , and meanwhile
to alleviate
the
inconvenience
attending
its continuance (u).
There is yet
another
species of tenure called
ancient
demesne, which differs but slightly from socage , or rather

perhaps is a peculiar form of socage , but requires separate
mention , having regard to its origin , and also because , so
far as there is a variation
from the ordinary characteristics
of socage tenure ,
it
is in the
direction
of villenage
or
copyhold tenure , the original
services
due from the tenants
being of a base or villein character .
Ancient
demesne
consists
of those lands
or manors ,
which , though
now perhaps granted
out to private
sub-
jects,
were actually
in the
hands of the
crown in the
time of Edward the
Confessor ,
or
William
the Con-
queror ; and so appear to have been by the great survey
in the Exchequer
called Domesday Book (x).
The tenants
of these lands , under the crown , were not all of the same
order
or degree .
Some of them, as Britton testifies (y),
though free, holding
their land like villeins , except that
their tenure was more certain .
Others were enfranchised by
royal charter
being
only bound in respect of their lands
to perform some of the better sort of villein
services
, but
those determinate
and certain ; as to
plough
the king's
land for so many
days , to supply his
court with such
a
quantity of
provisions , or
other
stated
services , all of
which are now changed into pecuniary rents
and in con-
sideration thereof they had
many
immunities
and privi-
leges granted to them (~) ;
as to try the right of their pro-
perty in a peculiar court of their own , called a court ofan-
cient demesne , by a peculiar process
denominated
a writ of
(a) F. N. B. 14, 16.
(y) " Ancient
demesnes are lands
which
were
part
of
the
ancient
manors annexed
to the crown , in
which
demesne
dwell
some
who
have been freely enfeoffed by char-
ter ; others who are free of
blood ,
and hold
land of us in villenage ,
and these are properly
our
soke-
men,
and
are
privileged
in
this
manner
that they are not to be
ousted from such tenements so long
as they perform
the services which
appertains
to their tenements , nor
can their
services
be increased
or
altered , so that
they
shall
do any
other
or greater services , or in any
other
way
than they have
been
used
to
do .
And
because
such
sokemen are the tillers of our lands ,
we will that they be not summoned
anywhere
to toil in juries
or in-
quests ."

right close (a ) ; not to pay toll or taxes ; not to contribute
to the expenses
of knights of the shire ; not to be put on
juries ; and the like (6) .
These tenants , therefore , have an interest equivalent to
a freehold
for notwithstanding
their
services were of a
base
and
villenous
origin (c), yet
the
tenants
were
esteemed
in all
other respects to be
highly
privileged
villeins
;
and
especially because
their services
were fixed
and determinate , and that they could
not be compelled.
(like pure villeins) to relinquish these
tenements
at the
lord's will , or to hold them against their own : " et
ideo ,"
says Bracton , " dicuntur liberi ."
Britton also, from such
their
freedom , calls them absolutely
sokemans (d) ,
and
their tenure sokemanries
; which he describes to be " lands
and tenements , which
are not held by knight-service , nor
by grand serjeanty , nor
by petit , but by simple
services,
being , as it were, lands
enfranchised by the king or his
predecessors from their ancient demesne."
And the same
name
is also given
them in Fleta (e) .
Hence Fitzher-
bert observes (ƒ) , that no lands are ancient demesne
, but
lands holden in socage: that, is , not in free and common.
socage , but in this amphibious
subordinate class of villein-
socage .
And it is possible , that as this
species of socage
tenure is plainly founded upon predial
services , or services
of the plough , it may have given cause to imagine that all
socage tenures arose from the
same
origin ; for want of
distinguishing
, with
Bracton ,
between
free
socage
or
socage of frank-tenure , and villein - socage
or
socage
of
ancient demesne (g) .
From the account which we have given of the principal
and fundamental
points of the doctrine of tenures , both
ancient and modern , it appears , that whatever

a religious

lands of the

for
ever (h).
The
service which they
were
bound to render for these lands was not certainly defined ;
but only in general
to pray for the souls of the donor and
his heirs , dead or alive ;
and therefore they did no fealty
(which
is
incident
to all
other
services
but
this (i) ) ,
because
this
divine

was of a nobler
and more

This is the tenure , by which
almost
all the ancient monasteries and religious

at present , this is a tenure of a nature very distinct
from
all
others ;
being
not
in
the
least feudal ,
but
merely
spiritual .
For , if the service be neglected , the law gives
no remedy by distress

merely
a complaint

CHAPTER VII.
ESTATES
OF INHERITANCE .
WE have
shown how the feudal
system with all
its
peculiar incidents
of tenure
was
adopted
by ,
or rather
forced upon , this country , with
an universality
hardly to
be found
elsewhere, so that the ownership
of every acre
of land throughout
the kingdom
became
subject to feudal
rules .
The most superficial
acquaintance with
the prin-
ciples of feudal
tenure
is sufficient
to render intelligible
the doctrine that no subject
can be an absolute owner of
land, a doctrine which formed
the main
feature of the
system , and
which
still
remains , though
nearly
every
other important
member has perished .
It is impossible
to understand
the laws regulating
the
possession
of landed
property , unless this fundamental
principle be carefully
borne in mind .
A subject may , in
the present decrepitude of the rules of tenure , have such
an interest in
land
and such powers of dealing with it ,
that, for all practical
purposes , there seems
none but a
verbal
difference
between his
right of ownership ,
and
those of an absolute owner ;
but this interest
and these
powers
are , in the
eye
of the law,
only
of
a limited
duration
and
extent .
There
must in
every
case
be a
possibility of their coming to an end , and of another and
paramount title supervening .
To use the terminology
of the law, a subject can only
be a tenant of
lands ,
having
an
estate
in them .
The
next subject for our consideration , therefore , is the nature
of estates , together with their
properties
and incidents .


206
ESTATES
OF INHERITANCE
.
Estates.
Three views
taken of
them.
First their
duration.
But , in order to prevent confusion in the mind , in dealing
with the present condition of things we must here premise
that a modification
of almost
every remark
is necessary
when it is to be applied to lands of copyhold tenure .
For
as we have
seen ,
a copyholder
is in
one
sense
a mere
tenant
at the will of the lord of the manor , although ,
this will of the lord
being
controlled
by custom , the
interest of the tenant may be as perdurable
as if the lands
were not held at the will of the lord of a manor but in
fee simple under the seignory of the crown alone.
The
estate which a man has in lands , tenements ,
or
hereditaments , denotes the whole interest which he has in
them , and his power over them (a) .
It is called in Latin
status , indicating
thereby the condition of the owner with
regard to his property .
There
may , however , be powers
unaccompanied
by benefit to their possessor
, which do not
amount to what
is
involved
in the meaning of estate.
Thus
an executor has in many
cases
a power conferred
upon him to sell land for the purposes of winding
up his
testator's
affairs ; this is no estate, the executors taking
nothing
without
an exercise of the power , and upon that
exercise, it is the vendee , and not the executor who takes
the
beneficial
interest in
the
estate .
Such
powers
are
perhaps therefore , better described as
powers over
some
estates in the land , rather than powers over the land itself.
The
mode in which
they operate is highly technical
(b).
To this we shall hereafter revert .
Estates
may be considered in three
different
views :
first , as regards
the duration
and extent of the
estate ;
secondly , as regards the time when the
estate
is to com-
mence in
beneficial
enjoyment
of the property ;
and
thirdly ,
as
regards
the number
and
connection of the
tenants or possessors .
First, as regards the duration and extent of the interest
(a) In
colloquial
language
the
word " estate " is, by an error of a
common
kind , often
used to indi-
cate a particular tract of land
be-
longing to an individual or family .
(b) See Sug . Powers , chs. 1 & 2.

FREEHOLD
ESTATES .
207
which a tenant has in the tenement :-The law recognises
various
periods during
which an estate may exist .
Thus
it may subsist for a period of a definite
number of years,
months , or days , or it may
be
made to
last during the
tenant's life , or that of any other man , terminating
at his
death ; or again it may continue after the tenant's death , so
long as any descendants from him shall live .
The greatest
estate, and that which most nearly approaches to absolute
dominion is one which may last not only during the tenant's
life, but so long as there shall continue any
heir to him,
without any restriction upon the title of his heirs .
It is an
estate limited to a man
and his heirs generally .
These
are the most usual estates , but others may be created par
taking more or less of a mixed character ; for instance , an
estate may
be limited to exist
for
100 years if J.
S.
should live
so
long , but
to terminate
upon the death of
J.
S.
This is not
an
estate during the life of J.
S.
because
by supposition
of law J. S. may live more than
100 years , neither
is it an estate for years , for it probably
will
not
continue
till the
expiration
of the
100
years.
We will treat the various
estates in their order .
In ancient
times
the
practice
of granting leases
for
terms of years , i.e. of creating
estates
for years , was rare,
it being
considered that the smallest interest which was
worthy
of the
acceptance of a freeman
was
one which
must endure during his life.
In feudal times , therefore ,
when
the
possession
of
land,
otherwise
than
at
the
arbitrary will of some lord , was only given to freemen , the
form of investiture
only applied to this or a greater estate .
Whence it arose that estates
for the life or for any longer
duration
than the life of the tenant , were called freehold
estates .
Liberum tenementum , frank tenement , or freehold
is defined by Britton as being " the possession of the soil
by a freeman " (c) .

ceremony of investiture

See also Doctor
and

Jermyn tells us that "the posses-
sion of the land

of England

freehold ."

became
afterwards the common law ceremony of livery of
seisin , and this , therefore , explains what is said by Little-
ton (d) , " that, where a freehold shall pass , it behoveth to
have livery of seisin ." In the case of incorporeal heredita-
ments , however , such as a rent , although
livery of seisin ,
or the actual physical
delivery
is not applicable , still
by
analogy to the
case of land , estates
of inheritance , or for
life
are
called
freehold .
Estates
limited
to
a
certain
number of years ,
are , in the
eye of the law, less
than
freehold ; livery of seisin , therefore , never applied to them ,
and
they
are
looked
upon
as
less
enduring , because
although
an estate for a 1000 years will undoubtedly
out-
last the lives of any number of living persons ; yet inas-
much as the law does not take account of the duration of
human life, it considers that the uncertainty of the latter
period
includes
a possibility that it may extend beyond
any given limit .
The laws applicable to the two classes
of
estates , those of freehold and those less than freehold , were
formerly
widely
different .
They
have
been
so far as-
similated
by modern
legislation
suited
to the
require-
ments of modern times , that there is, for most purposes ,
little difference material
to the interests of the community
other than that arising from the essential character of the
estates
themselves .
The
most
important
difference be-
tween the laws concerning a tenancy for years and one in
fee
simple , consists
in the different
destination
of the
property when the tenant dies intestate .
We proceed to consider in detail the different
estates ,
taking in
order first , those which
are freehold , and next
those of inferior degree.
We will begin with the greatest
estate a man
can have, an estate in fee simple
as it is
usually
called .
Tenant in fee simple
(or , as he is
frequently
styled ,
tenant in fee ) is he that has lands , tenements or heredita-
ments , (whether corporeal or incorporeal ) , to hold to him
and
his
heirs
for
ever (e) ,
generally ,
absolutely ,
and
(d) S. 59.
(e) Litt . s. 1.


FEE SIMPLE .
209
simply,
not restricted
to
any particular
kind
of
heir .
The
word tenant
(in Latin tenens ) indicates that the land
or hereditament
is holden .
By the theory of English law ,
as we have seen , all lands are holden
mediately or imme-
diately of the king (ƒ)
The king , therefore , alone has
absolutum et directum dominium (g).
A fee simple (feudum or feodum simplex (h ) ) , is , there-
fore,theutmost interest in landwhich a subject may possess ;
under it the tenant enjoys dominium utile (i) , or, the full per-
ception of every profit which may be derived from the soil ;
and hence it is that , in the most
solemn acts of law, a
man
having
this
estate in land is
said to be " seised in
his demesne as of fee ," to have the demesne or domi-
nium, i.e. property , not absolute however , but qualified , or
feudal
" as of fee ;" that is , it is held of
a superior lord ,
and either directly
or remotely of the king , in whom the
ultimate property resides .
The word fee or feodum then , as we have already seen ,
indicates this quality of tenure , and thus is distinguished
from allodium , or absolute
property in land , wholly irre-
spective of any
superior
lord , and without
any
duty of
rendering rent or service (k).
This primary
sense , how-
ever, in early times ceased to be the common acceptation
of the word , for (as sir Martin Wright justly observes
(1) )
the doctrine that " all lands are holden " having
been for
so many ages a fixed and undeniable
axiom , our English
lawyers became
accustomed to use the word fee , to express
the continuance
or quantity
of estate .
Thus
Littleton
says, " feodum
is the same as inheritance " (m) , and thus

fee , " in our legal
understanding
, signifieth
that the land
belongs to us and our heirs , in respect whereof the owner
is said to be seised in fee , and in this
sense the king is
said to be seised in fee " (n) : that is to say, the king may
have an estate of inheritance , but he can be the feudatory
of no man .
It is in this sense , also , that a man may have an estate
in fee in
incorporeal
hereditaments (o).
There
is this
difference , however , in the
technical
legal
description
of
the estates in the two species
of hereditaments , that , of a
corporeal
hereditament
of which
manual
occupation
can
be enjoyed,
a man is said to be seised in his demesne
as of
fee , the word
demesne denoting
beneficial
per-
sonal enjoyment ; thus the lands-part of a manor which
the lord of the
manor
himself occupies-are
called
the
demesne lands .
But of an incorporeal hereditament , such
as an
advowson , a man is said merely
to be seised
as
offee (p).
The fee simple , or inheritance of lands and tenements ,
comprises the whole
interest which
a subject may possess
in land
;
and this doctrine has been held so completely at
common law, that , although
the
estate may
determine
through
failure of heirs , yet it was considered that when
a fee simple has been
conveyed to any person , no interest
could by any possibility
be given to any other person in
the same lands : for example , if there were limitation to
A. and
his heirs , with
a further
limitation
, that in
case
there should
be a general
failure of A.'s heirs then to C.
in fee, this further
limitation was absolutely void , for the
first
limitation
carrying
the whole
fee
there
could
be
nothing
left in the grantor
which
can be limited
over.
The same principle
was extended to all cases where it was
attempted to limit a fee after the determination
of a
fee ,
even to cases less obviously contradictory
to the nature of
(n) Co. Litt. 1.

FEE
SIMPLE .
211
a fee simple .
Thus, if there were a limitation
to A. and
his heirs so long as B. should have issue, and upon failure
of B.'s heirs
then to C. in fee; or so long as they paid
annually to the dean and chapter of St. Paul's fourteen
marks , and if they failed in payment , then that their estate
should
cease , and that the said dean and chapter and their
successors should have the land , this latter limitation was
considered to be wholly void (g) .
This general
doctrine
that an
estate
cannot be limited
to take effect after the
natural determination
of
a fee
simple , still remains
in
force ; but , as we shall
hereafter see , the law has allowed
it to be practically
evaded
and means to be adopted for
causing
an abrupt
determination of a fee simple
to take
place , and then that
another
fee
simple
in
some
other
person should take the place of the one so cut short .
It is a principle of law, derived from
feudal
notions.
respecting
the
possession of land , that the
freehold
or
feudal seisin must never be without
an owner , and further ,
though
this was not
so strictly insisted upon , that the in-
heritance in fee always resides in some person or other . In
general there is little difficulty
in seeing how the estates ,
as
vested in particular
cases , accord with this principle ,
as to which
something
more will appear hereafter , when
treating of remainders .
But there are cases in which it
is not very obvious
how this
may be.
To take a much
discussed
instance ;
suppose a grant to John for life , and
afterwards
to the heirs of Richard , a living person.
Here
the seisin is in John , by virtue of his
freehold estate
for
life , but plainly, the inheritance
is not so , neither
is it in
any
person answering
the
description
of the heirs of
Richard , for
nemo
est hæres
viventis .
Formerly,
a
case
like this was explained by saying that during John's life
it was in abeyance
, or in gremio legis , or in nubibus , but
this
artificial
doctrine
is
not
now
accepted
,
the
true
opinion being that the inheritance
remains in the grantor
until some person arises
by the death of Richard , answer-
(g) 1 Eq . Abr. 186, pl. 3 ; Fearne , Cont . Rem . 373.
P

ing the description
given , and so capable of taking under
the grant.
Indeed it is obvious that if John died before
Richard , the only person who
could
enter would
be the
grantor , who might then
resume his former
estate , and
the estate given to Richard's
heir would never take effect.
The
establishment of this
opinion
is due to the treatise
upon
contingent
remainders , originally published
by the
late Mr.
Fearne
in the
year
1772 , the great
learning
of which , and
the
able discussions
therein
contained ,
have contributed
greatly
to the
clear understanding
of
many disputed
questions of this
nature .
A similar diffi-
culty in determining
where the inheritance
resides
occurs
in the
case
put
by Littleton (r ) , of land
belonging
to a
corporation
sole , as the parson of a church .
Here , during
the life of the
parson , the freehold of the glebe of the
parsonage is in him , but the fee simple , Littleton says , is
in abeyance
, and after the death of a parson , and before
the
church is
filled
by his
successor , the freehold
also
seems to be without an owner , or in abeyance .
Perhaps ,
however , notwithstanding
Littleton's view of this case , it
may be explained by observing that a freehold , equivalent
to one of inheritance , is in the
parson
subject
to the re-
striction of there being no power of alienation , and further,
that the successor
takes exactly as the heir would take on
intestacy in an ordinary case , the succession by blood being
replaced by the succession in the office of parson .
As to
the period
during which the
church
is void , it may be
noticed
that the successor must
then be in existence ,
though
not actually pointed
out till his institution and
induction .
He, on institution
, claims and can receive all
the rights
accruing
since the death of his predecessor (s) .
It
is
clear , however, that
the
original
grantor
and his
heirs are entitled to everything which is not taken by the
corporation ;
and the
estate
will
revert
to them on the
dissolution of the corporation .

FEE SIMPLE.
213
Such is the nature of an
estate
in fee-simple , which a
subject possesses .
It only remains to notice that the pos-
session of this estate carries with it the
invariable
right
of alienation , by which not
only
the
ownership of the
estate is transferred
from one
person to another , but in
some sense the estate is itself affected , for being before an
estate capable of enduring
so long
as there shall be any
heirs of the
alienor , after the
alienation it
becomes
an
estate, limited
to endure so long
as there shall be heirs of
the alienee , the latter class of heirs being substituted for
the former .
This right of free
alienation
constitutes
one
of the most valuable attributes of this estate .
The various
modes
of alienation
will
come under
our
consideration
when investigating
the various kinds of title under which
a man may claim an estate .
A few points may , however ,
here
be
noticed ,
regulating
the
grant
or
creation
of
an
estate ,
which
also
govern
the
present
powers
of
alienation .
" heirs" ne.
grant of fee.
The word " heirs " is necessary in the grant or donation , The word
in order to make
a fee , or inheritance .
For , if land be cessaryin
given to a man for ever , or to him and his assigns for ever , simple,
this
vests
in him but
an estate
for life (t).
This very
great nicety
about the insertion
of the word " heirs " in
all feoffments and grants , in order to vest a fee , is plainly
a relic of feudal strictness
; by which
we may
remem-
ber (u), it was required
that
the
form
of the donation
should
be
punctually
pursued ; or that,
as

Mr. Preston observes, that the word
" heirs," or, in the case of a corpo-
ration,
successors,"" needs not be
in the identical deed or grant
; and
therefore , where one to whom
lands
had
been
granted in fee does, after
reciting the grant , or without any
recital , grant
the lands to another ,
" as fully as they were granted to
him ," the fee-simple will pass with-
out any
limitation
to the heirs in
express terms .

at
this day , in conveying
an estate in

are un-
necessary and immaterial
. (2 Prest .

expresses it in the words
of Baldus, " donationes sint
stricti juris,
ne quis plus
donâsse
præsumatur
quam
in
donatione
expresserit ."
And
therefore ,
as
the
personal
abilities of the donee were originally supposed to be the
only
inducements
to the gift , the donce's
estate
in the
land
extended
only to his own person , and subsisted no
longer than his life ; unless the donor , by an express pro-
vision in the
grant , gave it
a longer
continuance , and
extended it also to his heirs .
But this rule
has been
softened by many exceptions (y).
In the case of wills made before the year
1838 , the
necessity for the use of the word " heirs " was dispensed
with if the testator
had sufficiently
expressed his inten-
tion that a devise should be in perpetuity .
Thus if the
devise were to A. in fee-simple (~), or for ever
(a) , or to
A. and his assigns or successors
for ever
(b) ; in all these
cases
the words
of perpetuity
or description
sufficiently
denote the intention
of the testator .
And as the power
of alienation by will was introduced
when feudal rigour
was rapidly declining , the court
adopted such
a liberal
construction
of wills
as would
give effect to that which
was thus manifestly
intended , though
not
couched
in the
formal language which had always been required in deeds .
There must , however , be no ambiguity
in the mode in
which
the intention
appears , and , therefore , a gift
to A.
and his assigns , since there
could be no
inconsistency
with this gift , that A. should take an estate for life only ,
that is all which will be taken under it (c) .
This question
as to the
estate
taken under
a will
cannot now arise in
cases
where the will has been made since the year
1837 ,
for it being
found that,
notwithstanding
the anxiety of
the court thus to give effect to the intention
of testators

which seemed the most probable , it was often defeated
from
not being sufficiently
expressed , it has been enacted
(d) ,
that a devise of any real estate without words of limita-
tion shall carry
the
fee-simple
or the whole
interest ,
whatever it may be, of the testator , unless a contrary in-
tention appear by the will.
In the peculiar assurances which
formerly
were made
with the aid of the courts by the
pretence of
actions ,
an estate was
conveyed
without
the
use
of
the
word
"heirs " (e). ; for , by these fines and
recoveries
(ƒ) , the
estate
in fee passed
by
the
operation
of
law.
The
zame result
occurs in many cases of release by deed , the
effect of which
is the extinction
of an
estate
or interest ,
and this effect
may be produced without the use of the
word " heirs " (g).
In creations of nobility by writ , the peer so created
has an inheritance
in his title , without
expressing
the
word " heirs ;"
for heirship
is implied
in the
creation ,
unless it be otherwise specially provided : but , in creations
by patent , which are stricti juris , the word " heirs " must
be inserted ,
otherwise
there is
no
inheritance (h) .
In
grants of lands to sole corporations
and their
successors
,
the word " successors
" supplies
the place of " heirs ;
for , as heirs take from the ancestor , so doth the successor
from the predecessor ( ) .
Nay , in a grant to a bishop , or
other sole spiritual

It appears from
recent inquiries in Parliament that
the crown cannot
now
create life
peerages .
(i) In a grant to a sole corpora-
tion, the word " heirs " will not con-
vey a fee any
more than the word
" successors "
would in a grant to a
natural person . For instance , a limi-
99
tation
to a parson as such, and to his
heirs , gives him only
an estate for
life .

"frankalmoign " supplies
the place of " successors
" (as
the word " successors " supplies the place of " heirs " )
ex vi termini ; and in all these cases , a fee simple vests in
such sole corporation .
But , in a grant of lands to a cor-
poration
aggregate , the word " successors " is not neces-
sary, though usually inserted : for although
such
simple
grant
be
strictly
only
an
estate
for
life ,
yet ,
a
a
corporation
never dies , such estate for life is perpetual , or
equivalent to a fee simple , and therefore the law allows it
to be one ( ).
Lastly , in the case of the king , a fee simple
will vest in him, without
the
word " heirs "
or " suc-
cessors " in the grant ; partly from prerogative royal , and
partly from a reason similar to the last , because
the king
in judgment of law never dies () .
But the general
rule
is , that the word " heirs " is necessary to create
an estate
of inheritance .
In discussing
hitherto
the nature
and
quality
of an
estate
in
fee simple , or the largest estate a man
may
possess in lands , we have treated it as absolute , free from
condition
or qualification
(m ) .
But besides
such absolute
successors , the word " heirs ," in the
one case, and " successors " in the
other , come within this rule .

fees there are others commonly called base
fees , which
are
to be distinguished
by the peculiarity
that they are liable
to come to a determination
sooner
than the natural deter-
mination of a fee simple , by the
cesser
of some
other
continuous
fact , the duration of which has been made the
measure
of
the
continuance
in existence of the estate .
Thus , in the case of a grant to A. and his heirs , tenants of
the manor of Dale ; in this instance , whenever the heirs of
A. cease to be tenants of that manor (n), the grant is entirely
defeated .
So , when Henry VI . granted to John Talbot,
lord
of the
manor of Kingston -Lisle in
Berks , that he
and his heirs , lords of the said manor , should be
peers of
the
realm , by the title of barons
of Lisle ;
here John
Talbot had a base
or qualified fee in that dignity (0), and
the instant
he or his heirs quitted
the seignory of this
manor , the dignity was at an end.
This estate is a fee ,
because

ESTATES
OF INHERITANCE .
Estate in
fee-tail.
most common , or indeed in the present day the only one
that is not very uncommon is, a fee -simple which continues
so long as A. or any lineal descendants of A. shall be alive ,
and no longer ; this
is a base fee , and is one which most
frequently
in
practice
arises
in a manner
which
will
appear hereafter (p) .
A base
fee is in no way distin-
guishable
from
an absolute
fee -simple ,
except by this
liability to an abnormal termination .
It is to be remembered (q), that, though
these base or
qualified
fees are of a duration which may be considerably
less than that of an estate in fee simple ;
yet
a tenant in
fee
simple
cannot , upon
granting
a base
fee , reserve to
himself an estate in remainder
to come into possession
upon the determination of the base fee.
What in such a
grant is reserved to the grantor
is merely a right of entry
upon the determination of the fee so created (r) .
The
next
estate
which
we shall notice
is
an
estate
limited to a man and the heirs of his body begotten . This
is such an estate
that it descends
to the issue of the first
owner in regular succession ; but it comes
to an end upon
the failure of his
descendants
on the happening of which
event the land reverts
to the grantor
or creator
of the
estate.
This
estate
is called an estate tail , feodum tallia-
tum (s), or an estate cut out of the
greater
estate
in
fee -simple ;
and
herein we notice
at
once
a distinction
which the law makes between this and
a base fee such as
that above described , where the
estate
continues
so long
as
there
should
be
descendants
of
a given
person .
(p ) In Seymour's
Case, ubi
sup .,
the
estate which gave
rise to the
litigation
was
held
to
be of this
kind ,
and
there
being
no lineal
descendants
of the
propositus
the
estate was at an end.
(q) Ante , p. 210.
(r) Such
a right of entry is an
incorporeal
hereditament
which de-
scends to the heirs , or is devised by
the will, of the
grantor , like
other
real
property
(see ante, p. 19, note
(0) ).

FEE-TAIL .
219
Because, although the duration
of the
estate -tail is the
same
as that of the base
fee, yet there may
be an estate
in
fee tail,
or a series of
estates
in fee tail ,
or
estates
for life followed
ultimately
by an
estate
in fee
simple ,
limited to take effect in succession , one after the other , as
the prior estates
determine .
Thus , a limitation
to A. and
the heirs of his body , and after the determination of this
estate to B. (a living person ) for life , and after B.'s death
to C. (also a living person) and the heirs of his body , and
after
the
determination
of the last
estate , to D. and his
heirs , would
be a perfectly good limitation
.
But a limi-
tation to A.
and his heirs
so long as
B.
or any lineal
descendant
of B.
shall
live, with
remainder to C. and
his
heirs , would
have
no
effect
in giving
any
estate
to C. (t).
There
are
also
special
forms of estate -tail ; thus , the
limitation may not only be to a man
and the heirs of his
body generally , but it may be confined to him and the heirs
of his body by a particular
wife , or to him and the heirs
male of his body , or the heirs female of his body .
In all
these
cases
the
descent is only to those who fall within
the
special
description
;
thus
no
daughter
or
remoter
female
issue ,
or
person
claiming
through
any
female ,
could succeed
to an estate in tail male (u) , and conversely ,
no male or person derived from
one could claim an estate
given in tail female (x) .
Thus , if the
donee in tail male
has a daughter ,
who
dies leaving
a son, the grandson
in this case cannot inherit the
estate -tail ; for he cannot

that
there can be no remainder after afee,
for having been good at its creation
it does not lose its character by the
alteration of the prior

provides
for
certain
consequences
which might
ensue upon the union
of the two estates.

deduce his descent wholly by heirs male (y).
And as the
heir male must convey his descent wholly by males , so must
the heir female wholly
by females .
And therefore , if a
man has two estates -tail, the one in tail male , the other in
tail female ; and he has issue a daughter , which daughter
has issue a son ; this grandson
can succeed
to neither of
the estates ; for he cannot trace his descent wholly either
in the male or female line (2).

further
limitation
of
the strictness of the feudal donation
,
the word

,
or
some
other
words

,
are
necessary
to
make
it
a
fee tail
,
and ascertain
to
what
heirs
in
particular
the fee
is
limited
.
If
,
therefore
,
either
the
words
of
inheritance
or
words
of
procreation
be
omitted
,
albeit the others are inserted
in
the grant
,
this
will not make
an estate
-
tail
.
As
,
if
the grant
be to
a
man and the issue of his body
,
to
a
man and his seed
,
to
a
man and the children
,
or
offspring
;
all these are only
estates
for life
,
there wanting the words
of

,

(a).
So
,
on
the other hand
,
a
gift by deed
to
a
man
,

,

or

,
is
an
estate

In order fully to understand
the nature of these estates-
tail , which we have been describing , we must refer to their
history.
Our ancestors held , that a gift to a man and the A condi-
heirs of his body was a gift subject to the provision
that at common
it should revert to the donor , if the donee
had no heirs of to
the
donor

They therefore called
it
a

simple
,
on condition
that he had issue
.
So that
as
soon
as
the grantee
had condition
,
any issue born
,
his
estate was supposed
to
become
abso-
lute
,
by the performance
of
the condition
;
at
least
for
these three purposes
:
1.
To enable the tenant
to
aliene
the land
,
and thereby
to

his own issue

2.
To
subject him to forfeit it for treason
, which he could not do ,
till issue born , longer than for his own life ; lest
thereby
the inheritance
of the issue , and reversion of the donor ,
might have
been
defeated (h).
3. To empower him to
charge the land with rents , commons , and various
other
incumbrances , so as to bind his issue ( ).
And
this was
thought
the more
reasonable ,
because , by the birth of
issue , the possibility of the donor's reversion was rendered
more distant
and precarious : and his
interest
seems
to
have been the
only one which the law, as it then
stood ,
was solicitous to protect ;
little regard
being had to the
right of succession
intended to be vested in the issue.
However , if the tenant did not in fact deal with the land ,
no effect was produced on the legal character of his estate ;
for ifthe issue had afterwards
died , and then the tenant ,
or original
grantee , had died , without making
any aliena-
tion ; the land , by the terms of the donation , could descend
to none but the heirs of his body , and therefore , in default
of them , must have reverted to the donor ; moreover , after
the death of the
issue, the donee could not aliene unless
other issue were born (k).
For which
reason , in order to
subject the
lands
to the ordinary
course of descent, to
collaterals
in default of descendants , the donees of these
conditional
fee simples took care to aliene as soon
as they
had issue ; and afterwards
repurchased the lands , which
gave them
a fee simple
absolute , that would
descend to
the heirs
general , according to the course of the common.

And thus stood the old law with regard to
fees of

character : which things, says sir Edward

are

statute revived in some sort
the ancient
feudal restraints
which
were originally laid
on alienations , by enacting ,
that from
thenceforth
the will of the donor be observed ;
and that the tenements so given (to a man and the heirs
of his body ) should at all events go to the issue, if there
were any ; or, if none, should revert to the donor (n).

are, " That the

expressed
should
be
observed , so
that they to whom a tenement
was
so given

It will be observed
that
the

does
not
absolutely
annul
every alienation
the
tenant
in tail
may
make ,
but
merely
provides
that no alienation
shall prevent the
title of the issue in tail, and of the
donor's
heirs ; and this distinction
will be found to be important.

And
hence it is that Littleton tells us (p) , that tenant in fee-

Such was the origin of estates -tail ; the next question ,
therefore , is, what
things
may , or may not , be entailed
under the statute
de donis .
Tenements is the only word
used in the statute :
and this sir Edward
Coke (q) ex-
pounds
as
comprehending
all
corporeal
hereditaments
whatsoever ; and also all incorporeal hereditaments , which
savour of the realty , that is , which
issue out of corporeal
ones , or which
concern,
or
are
annexed
to , or may
be
exercised within the
same ;
as rents , estovers , commons ,
and the like.
Also
offices
and dignities
which
concern
lands , or have relation
to fixed and certain places , may be
entailed (r).
But
mere personal
chattels , which
savour
not at all of the realty , cannot be entailed .
Neither can
an office , which merely relates to such personal chattels ;
nor an annuity , which
charges only the person , and not
the lands of the grantor .
But in these last , if granted to
a man and the heirs of his body, the grantee has either an
absolute interest at once , or at least a fee conditional
such
as at common law existed before the statute ; and by his
alienation
(in the latter
case after issue born ) may bar the
claim of every person whether heir or reversioner ( s).

,
copyhold

cannot be entailed ,

Inconveni-
encesof
The incidents
to a tenancy in tail under the statute of
Westminster
2 are principally these (a) :
a tenant in tail
may commit waste on the entailed land , by felling timber ,
pulling down houses , or the like , without being impeached
or called to account for the same by the issue in tail (b) .
Next, the widow
of the tenant
in tail shall have her
dower, or life interest , in a third of the tenement , in like
manner
as the widow
of tenant in fee simple ;
the right
to which we shall hereafter more fully explain .
Lastly , an estate -tail, may notwithstanding
the appar-
ently adverse declaration of the statute , be barred or con-
verted into an ordinary
estate in fee simple by the tenant in
tail.
This now can only
be done in the special manner
and subject to certain restrictions pointed out by a modern
enactment ;
previously
to
which ,
however , it could be
effected by certain fictitious
legal processes
called common
recoveries
and
fines , the nature
of which , though
now
obsolete, it may be well shortly to examine . These ancient
as well as the present methods of depriving
the issue of a
tenant in tail of the benefit of the gift which the law had
declared should remain to them , we shall , therefore , in a
subsequent chapter explain .
Thus much for the nature of estates -tail : the establish-
settlements, ment of
which
family
law (as it is properly
styled by
Pigott (c) ) , occasioned
infinite
difficulties and disputes (d) .

by mortgaging it for as much
as it was worth ; innumer-
able latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of
the lands they had fairly bought ; of suits in consequence
of which our ancient books are full : and treasons were
encouraged
;
as estates
tail were not liable to forfeiture ,
longer than for the tenant's life .

branded, as the source of new contentions
and mischiefs
unknown
to the common law ;
and
almost
universally
considered
as the
common
grievance
of
the
realm (e).
But as the nobility were
always
fond
of this
statute ,
because it preserved their
family estates
from forfeiture ,
there was little hope of procuring
a repeal by the legisla-
ture , and
therefore , by the connivance
of an active and
politic
prince , a method was devised to evade it.

declared by the
judges
to be a sufficient

courts

Edward

observing ( ) (in the disputes between the houses of York

on families , whose estates were protected by the sanctuary
of entails , gave his countenance to this
proceeding , and
suffered Taltarum's
case to be brought before the court (2) :
wherein , in consequence
of the principles then laid down , it
was in effect determined , that a common recovery suffered
by a tenant in

be

adopted as ordinary
assurances
, and continued
to be
so
until , as we shall
see , they were abolished to make way
for a more simple mode of effecting
the
same object in
manner suited to modern ideas and wishes .
Whilst , how-
ever, they
existed
they
were looked
upon
as the legal
mode of conveyance , by which
a tenant in tail might dis-
pose of his lands and tenements :
so that no court would
suffer them to be shaken or reflected
on , and even acts
of parliament (1) by a side-wind countenanced and estab-
lished them .
This
expedient
having
greatly
abridged
estates -tail
with regard
to their
duration , others were soon invented
to strip them
of
other privileges .
The next that was
attacked was their freedom from forfeitures
for treason .
For , notwithstanding
the large
advances
made
by re-
coveries, in the
compass of
about
threescore
years ,
towards unfettering
these inheri ances , and thereby sub-
jecting
the lands
to forfeiture , the rapacious prince then
reigning , finding
them frequently
resettled
in a similar
manner , to suit the convenience of families , had address
enough to procure a statute (m) , whereby all estates of in-
heritance
(under
which
general
words
estates
tail
were
covertly included ) are declared to be forfeited to the king
upon any conviction of high treason .
The
next
attack
which
they suffered in order of time
was by the statute
32 Hen.

c.
28 ,
whereby
certain
leases
made by tenants in tail, which do not tend to the
prejudice
of the issue , were allowed
to be good in
law ,
and to bind the issue in tail.
This power of granting
leases
by
simple
deed
without
enrolment ,
has
been
extended
so as to allow a tenant in tail to grant a lease
decided , that,
under
the
circum-
stances, the
entail
had
not
been
destroyed ; but they founded
their
argument
upon the assumption
that
a recovery
properly
suffered would
have destroyed it.

had been adopted .
Fines, as they were called , which were,
like common recoveries , in appearance a species
of judicial
action , had acquired under Edward
I. (0) some validity
in
effecting this
object , which , after being
destroyed
in
the
reign of Edward III . (p) was revived by acts of Richard
III. (9) and Henry VII. (r) , and extended first by judicial
interpretation (s) , and subsequently by statutory
declara-
tion, in the
reign
of
Henry VIII . (t) ,
to operate as
a
complete
bar to all persons claiming under an entail .
Thenceforth fines continued
to be in use as a means of
barring all claim by the issue in tail until their abolition ,
which
took
place at the same time as that of common
recoveries (u) .
In order , however , that the property of the
crown might be in no danger of infringement
, all estates-
tail created by the
crown ,
and of which
the reversion
remained in the crown , were excepted out of the statute ;
and with the
like
object ,
and for
fear of
ambiguity ,
another act (x) was
passed
(declaratory , however ,
only of
the previous law (y) )
which
enacted,
that a common
recovery
should not bar the reversion in the
king of an
estate-tail created
by the crown .
This special protection
given to reversions in the crown has been preserved by the
modern act (z).

WE are next
to consider
such
estates
of freehold
as Estates for
are not of inheritance , but for life only .
And of these
estates for life, some are conventional , or expressly created
by the acts of the parties ; others merely legal , or created
by construction
and
operation of law (a) .
We will con-
sider them both in their order .
by deed, &c.
I. Estates for life , expressly created by grant or devise
I. Created
(which alone are properly conventional ) , are where a grant
or gift is made of lands or tenements to a man , to hold for
the term of his own life , or for that of any other person ,
or for more lives
than
one : in any of which
cases he is
styled
tenant
for life ;
only when he holds the estate by
the life of another , he is usually
called tenant pur autre
vie(b).
These
estates
for life are , like inheritances , of a
feudal
nature ; they were given or conferred by the same
feudal
rights
and
solemnities ,
the same
investiture
or
livery of seisin , as
fees
themselves
were ; and they were
held by fealty , if demanded , and such conventional
rents
and
services ,
as
the
lord or lessor
and
his tenant
or
lessee, had agreed
on.
Estates
for life, rendering
rent ,
are now not uncommon in the case of lands belonging
to
ecclesiastical
corporations ,
colleges,
and
other
similar
proprietaries.

Estates for life may be created , not only by the express Created by
words before mentioned , but also by

without
defining
or limiting any specific
estate (c) .
As ,
if one grants to A. B. the manor of Dale , this makes him
tenant for life (d ) .
For though , as there are no words of
inheritance
or heirs mentioned in the grant , it cannot be
construed to be a fee , it shall
however be construed to be
as large an estate as the words of the donation will bear ,
and therefore
an estate for life.
Also such a grant at
large , or
a grant
for term of life generally , shall be con-
strued to be an estate for the life of the grantee (e) , in case
the grantor
has authority
to make such a grant
:
for an
estate for
a man's own life is more beneficial
and of
a
higher nature than for any other life ; and the rule of law
is, that all grants
are
to be taken most strongly against
the grantor (f) ,
unless in the
case of the king . If the
grantor has not power to make a grant for the life of the
grantee , the
rule
is
different ;
and therefore a grant by
a tenant in tail,
without
words of
limitation
,
and
not
enrolled
so as to operate
as a disentailing
deed , is construed
to be a grant for the life of the grantor (g).
Estates
for life may be
created by any of the modes
of assurance
or
conveyance proper
for
passing
freehold
estates ; of the various
sorts of these we shall
see more
hereafter .
The
rule that
a gift to a person ,
without
any addition
of words of inheritance ,
conferred
on
him
only an estate for life , was formerly
applied to the con-
struction of wills as well as of deeds .
It was found , how-
ever, that it very frequently
had the effect
of defeating
the intention of testators , who little suspected when they
made their wills ,
as
must
often
happen , without
pro-
fessional
assistance, that
a devise to A. B. of all their
lands gave only a life interest in them .
The recent Wills
Act (h), therefore , has abrogated this technical rule ,

Waste , vastum , is

that already mentioned , and permissive , as where houses
are allowed to fall into ruin , or sea walls to fall in (9) ; but
we may remark
that , as regards
tenants for life , the re-
medy at law for permissive waste appears to be doubtful (r) ,
and in equity is none at all (s).
Where the commission
of acts of waste ,
such as cutting down
timber

proceeds
being
invested for
the benefit of the remaindermen , but the annual
interest
being
given
to the
tenant
for life (t) .
But where
the
waste is wholly unauthorised , the proceeds
of the waste or
the things wasted belong to the owner of the first
estate
unimpeachable for waste , if there be one in existence at
the time , and if there be none it belongs to the owner of
the first estate of inheritance , and ought to be retained for
his benefit , the annual interest in this case not being given
to the tenant for life so improperly
committing
waste (u).
It is
common , in modern
settlements
by which
life
estates are limited , to create
them " without impeachment
of waste ."
The effect of this is to give the tenant for life
very enlarged
powers
as to doing
acts of the nature of
waste (x).
Still his power , in this
respect , is not
even
then equal to that which a tenant in fee simple possesses ;
because courts of equity have established a doctrine that Equitable
he may not commit any act which tends to the destruction
of the thing settled ( y) ;
as , for instance , the pulling down
of a castle (*) or family mansion ,
or even cutting any
timber which has been planted
or left standing for orna-
ment (a).

taste is allowed to influence the

whether

or profits of the crop , and they may enter for the purpose
of carrying them away ( g) : for the estate was determined
by the act of God , and it is a maxim in the law, that actus
Dei neminifacit injuriam .
The representatives , therefore ,
of the tenant for life shall
have the emblements
to com-
pensate for the labour
and
expense
of tilling , manuring ,
and sowing the lands ; and also for the encouragement of
husbandry, which being
a public
benefit , tending to the
increase
and

1 Williams
on
Executors , ubi
sup .
With respect
to the person who
is entitled
to
emblements ,
Lord
Ellenborough
observed , in
West v.
Moore,
8 East ,
343, that the
dis-
tinction between the heir and
de-
viseein this respect was
capricious
enough.
In the testator
himself,
the standing
corn , though
part of
the realty , subsists
for
some
pur-
poses, as a chattel
interest , which
goeson his death to his executors ,
as against the
heir ;
though ,
as
against the executors , it goes
to
the devisee of the land, who
is in
the place of the heir , unless other-
wise directed .
This
is
founded
upon a presumed
intention
of the
devisor in favour
of the
devisee .
But this again may be rebutted
by
words which show an intent that
the executor
shall
have it.
A de-
vise to the executor of all the tes-
tator's stock
on the
farm , entitles
him to the crops , in opposition
to
the devisee of the estate.

cutor's claim is good

(Id.; Owen , 102 ; Dyer,
It was
held formerly, that if a

to B., and before severance A. dies ,
B.
shall
have them (Anon.,
Cro.
Eliz . 61 ;
see Spencer's Case, Win .
51 ; Godb . 159) ; but the contrary
has been long
established , and the
present rule is that the executor of
the tenant
for life shall have them ,
it being for the benefit of the king-
dom ,
which
is interested
in the
continual
produce of corn , and will
not suffer them to go to
the
re-
mainderman .
(Lawton
v. Lawton ,
3 Atk. 16.)
(g) Co. Litt. 56 a.
(h) If therefore
the person whose
estate
determines
has not
himself
been
at the
expense
of the tillage
and sowing , the rule
does not
ne-
cessarily
apply ;
as,
where
A.
having
sown land , grants it to B.
for life ,
remainder
to
C. , and
B.
dies before the crop
is
severed , C.
shall have
the
crop
and
not
B.'s
executor .
(Grantham
v. Hawley,
Hob.
135 ; Vin . Ab., Emblements
(A).)
But if a
testator ,
having
sown the land, devise it to
A. for
life, without any remainder
over,


238
FREEHOLDS
, NOT
OF INHERITANCE .
Therefore ,
by the
feudal
law, if a tenant
for life
died
between
the
beginning
of
September
and the
end of
February , the lord , who was entitled to the reversion , was
also entitled
to the profits of the whole year ;
but if he
died
between
the
beginning
of March and the end of
August, the heirs of the tenant
received
the whole ( ¿) .
From this
our law of emblements
seems
to have
been
derived , but with very considerable improvements .
So it
is
also , if a man be tenant for the life of another , and
cestui que vie, or he on whose life the land is held ,
dies
after the corn sown , the tenant pur
autre
vie shall
have
the emblements (k).
The
same is also the rule , if a life
estate
be determined by the act of law .
Therefore , if a
lease be
made
to husband
and wife
during
coverture ,
(which gives them a determinable
estate for life , )
and the
husband sows the land , and afterwards
they are divorced
a vinculo
matrimonii , the husband shall have the emble-
ments in this case ; for the sentence
of divorce is the act
of law (1) .
But if an estate for life be determined by the
termine by
tenant's own act,
(as , by forfeiture for waste committed
;
or , if a tenant during widowhood thinks proper to marry ),
in these,
and
similar
cases ,
the
tenants ,
having
thus
determined
the
estate
by their own
acts , shall not be
entitled
to take
the
emblements (m).
The doctrine

None, if

What are
emble-
ments.
and
both
the
testator
and A.
die
before the crop
is
severed , the ex-
ecutors
of A.
shall
have
the crop
(Winch , 51 ; Co. Litt.
55 b) ; but
if there had been a remainder
over,
the
remainderman
would
have
been entitled .
The ground of this
distinction may
be collected
from
the preceding note .
From a dictum
in Hob . 132, it would
appear that
the rule is different
in
respect of a
grant
inter vivos
; and that there ,
if the ultimate
remainderman
die
before
severance , the
grantor's
ex-
ecutors
are
entitled
to the
crops
sown by such grantor .
(i) Feud . 1. 2, t. 28.
(k) The rule
applies
to any un-
certain
estate or
interest
; as, for
instance , to an estate for years , de-
terminable
with
a life
(Gilb. Ev.
215), or to an estate at will, deter-
mined
by the
lessor ,
or
by
the
death
of the lessee.

emblements
extends
not only to corn sown , but to roots
planted (n) , and other
annual
artificial
profits , but it is
otherwise of fruit -trees , grass ,
and the like ; which
are
not planted
annually
at the
expense and
labour of the
tenant , but are either a permanent , or natural profit of the
earth (o).
For
when
a man plants
a tree, he cannot be
presumed
to plant it in
contemplation
of any
present
profit ; but merely with a prospect of its being
useful
to
himself in future , and to future successions of tenants (p) .

of Lord
Coke
(Co. Litt . 55 b. ) ; but both Godol-

worth
(Office

assert that
carrots ,
turnips,
and
other annual
roots
belong
to the
heir, because the executor is not at
liberty to break
the

to
reach
them.

for life.
The
same ; for the law of estovers
and emble-
ments , with regard to the tenant for life , is also law with
regard to his under -tenant , who represents him and stands
in his
place (r)
and greater ; for in those
cases where
tenant for life shall
not have the
emblements ,
because
the estate
determines by his own act, the exception
shall
not reach his
lessee , who is a third person .
As in the
case of a woman who holds
durante viduitate ; her taking
husband is her own act, and therefore deprives her of the
emblements :
but if she
leases
her
estate
to an under-
tenant , who sows the land , and she then marries , this her
act shall not deprive the tenant of his emblements , who is
a stranger , and could not prevent her (s).
The lessees
of
tenants for life had also at the common law another most
Apportion
unreasonable advantage ; for , at the death of their lessors ,
the tenants for life , these under -tenants might, if they
pleased , quit the premises , and pay no rent to any body
for the occupation of the land since the last quarter
day,
or other day assigned for payment of rent (t).
To remedy
which it is now
enacted , that the
executors
or admini-
strators of a tenant

death
any
lease
determined ,
shall
recover of the
lessee
a rateable pro-
portion of rent, from the last day of payment to the death

In
order
to
promote the
improvements
of property ,
powers have been given by the legislature to tenants for life
to charge the inheritance in certain cases where the money
raised
is laid
out in draining , irrigation , embankment
of rivers , erection of labourers ' cottages, and in making

improvements ,

a tenant for life has power in a suitable case to dedicate a
piece of the land to which he is so entitled as a site for a
church or school , or other buildings for the promotion
of
religion or education (d).
And
under another act (e) , he
may , with
the
approbation
of the
court
of chancery ,
dedicate lands
to the
public
for roads or other
similar
purposes , if to do so will prove
advantageous to the rest
of the estate .
In other cases where land is purchased for public works
under
the
authority
of special
acts of parliament ,
the
tenant for life is empowered to enter into an agreement
as to the price to be paid , and also to carry out the agree-
ment by conveying the fee simple
upon the
price
being
paid
into the court
of chancery (f).
Similar
powers
of dealing
with
the
inheritance
have
been
created
by
statute to meet the
cases
of settlements
made by will
when the lands are required for payment of the debts of
the testator (g).
A tenant
for life formerly
could
not
(unless , as was
commonly
the
case ,
the
settlement
under
which
he
claimed
gave him
power to do so) make any disposition
of the land which would
continue valid after his death ,
for his
own
interest
terminating
then
there
could
be
nothing which his
dealings could
affect afterwards .
The
inconvenience
of not being
able to make a lease which
would unquestionably
endure throughout the term created
by it, led to giving tenants
for life
a limited power of
binding their successors by a lease.

Had it called
him
tenant in tail without issue , this
had
only
related
to
the
present
fact,
and
would
not
have
excluded
the possibility of future
issue.
Had he
been
styled
tenant
in
tail without possibility
of issue ,
this
would exclude time past as well as present , and he might
under
this
description
never have had any possibility of
issue .
No definition , therefore , could
so
exactly
mark
him out , as this of tenant in tail after
possibility
of issue
extinct , which (with
a precision
peculiar
to our own law)
not only takes in the possibility
of issue in tail , which he
once
had , but also
states that
this
possibility is now
extinguished
and gone .
This estate must be created by the act of God , that is,
by the death of that person out of whose body the issue
was to spring ,
for no limitation, conveyance, or
other
human
act
can
make
it (m ) . If land be given

But a possibility of issue is always
supposed to exist in law, unless extinguished by the death
of the parties
even though

be

This estate is of an amphibious
nature , partaking
partly
of an

and partly of an estate for life .
The

is , in truth ,
only
tenant for life, but he enjoys
many of the privileges of a tenant in tail ; for instance , he
is under no restriction

rule, as by cutting
down ornamental
trees , he will not be
allowed
to retain
the proceeds, which will be impounded
for the benefit of the owner of the first estate of inheritance
in remainder (q).
We may also look upon this tenant in another point of
view, as being
a tenant in tail , subject to many of the
restrictions
of a tenant for life ; thus he formerly
forfeited
his estate, if he aliened it in fee - simple (r) : whereas such
alienation
by tenant in tail, though voidable
by the issue ,
was
no forfeiture
of the
estate
to the reversioner :
who
cannot be concerned in interest , till all possibility
of issue
be extinct .
But, in general ,
the law looks
upon
this
estate as equivalent
to
an estate for life only ;
and ,
as
such , will permit this tenant to exchange his estate
with
a tenant for life ;
which
exchange can only be made, as
we shall
see hereafter , of estates
that
are
equal in their
nature .
If this
tenant
convey his estate

of the alienee, it is but an
ordinary
estate
for the

In this case
he shall , on the death of his wife , hold the lands
for his
life, as tenant by the curtesy of England (u) .
This
estate , according to Littleton , has its denomina-
tion ,
because
it is used within
the
realm
of England
only, the word perhaps
denoting
that it was recognised
by the courts of England (x) ; and it is said in the Mir-
rour (y) to have
been
introduced
by king Henry I.; it
appears also to have been the established law of Scotland ,
where it probably
was introduced
from England (~) , and
was there called curialitas (a).
It is likewise used in Ire-
land , by virtue of an ordinance of king Henry III. (6. )
But
it appears (c) to have obtained in Normandy
; 'and
was
likewise
used among the ancient Almains or Germans
( ).
And yet it is not generally
apprehended to have been a
consequence
of feudal tenure (e), though
some substantial
feudal reasons
may be given for its introduction
.
For , if
a woman seised of lands
hath issue by her husband , and
dies, the husband
is the natural
guardian
of the child,
and
as
such is in reason entitled
to the
profits
of the
claims ,
and
from
some late crea-
tions, by which women
have
been
made
peeresses in
order
that
the

for they could not have been
aliened without his
consent
,
which
would

But
of
some incorporeal
hereditaments
a
man may
be
tenant by the curtesy
though
there have been no actual
seisin
of
the wife
;
as
,
in

of

where the
church
has not become void
in
the
lifetime
of
the wife
which
a
man
may
hold

because
it
is
impossible
ever
to
have actual seisin of
it,

Crying indeed
is

of
its

it

The

also be born

if

the

because
,
at

,
he was
clearly not entitled

In the case men-

of

to
look upon
it
as

TENANT BY THE CURTESY .

shall not afterwards
be taken from him (s) .
In gavelkind
lands , a husband
may be tenant by the curtesy without
having any issue (t) ; but the custom there is that he only
has half the
lands
and loses
these by a second mar-
riage (u).
In general there must be issue born : and such
issue
as
is
also
capable
of inheriting the
mother's
es-
tate (x) .
Therefore , if a woman
be tenant in tail male ,
and
have
only
a daughter
born ,
the
husband
is
not
thereby entitled to be tenant by the curtesy ; because
such
issue female can never inherit the estate
in tail male (y) .
And this suggests
the principal reason, why the husband
cannot be tenant by the curtesy of any lands of which the
wife was not actually
seised , because, in order to entitle
himself to such estate , he must have begotten
issue that
may be heir to the wife : but no one, by the old rule of
law (z) , could be heir to the ancestor of any land , whereof
the
ancestor
was not
actually
seised
; and
therefore ,
as
the husband
had never begotten
any issue that could be
heir to those lands , he could not be tenant of them by the
curtesy (a) , and this rule
remains , although
the law out
of which it arose has been abrogated . It is not necessary,
however , that the issue begotten by the husbandshould
be heir apparent
of the
land , it is sufficient
that
there
should be a possibility
of its inheriting
.
Thus if a woman
be solely seised of lands in fee - simple and have a son by
a former
marriage , yet her husband , if he have issue by
her , shall be tenant by the curtesy , for possibly
the child
of the second
marriage might have inherited the land (b) .
The
same will
happen if the wife be convicted of felony
after the birth of the issue (c).

For a similar reason there can be
no curtesy of a joint estate of inheri-
tance .

in

case
the

of the
widow's
dower
seems
to
have been thrown by the
land during the nonage
of
the heir
,
entirely
upon the socage lands
if
of
sufficient
value
.
This
dower fell
with the other incidents
of

.
It
gained
its name from
the
widow
,

endowing herself
of

solely (h) seised
of an

presently
noticed , the wife
had the third part of all the
lands
and tenements
whereof
he was
seised
at any time
during the coverture , to hold to herself for the term of her
natural life. Where the land was gavelkind , the widow was
entitled
to a moiety of the lands , but only
so long as she
remained chaste and unmarried (k) ; and of lands held by
the tenure of borough English , she took the whole for her
life.
But over copyhold lands , which depend for all their
incidents
upon the customs of the manor of which
they
form part, the widow
had no claim
unless
there
was a
special
custom to that effect.
Where such a custom has
existed the widow's claim is usually called free-bench , and
is regulated wholly by the customs .
Sometimes she may
take a third, sometimes half, and sometimes the whole of
the lands for her life.
But usually
only those lands of
which her
husband was
seised
at the time of his death ,
and not , as in the case of dower , under the old law, of all

at any time during the coverture he had

(1) The banishment
of the hus-

Parliament,
being
a civil
death ,
was held to entitle
the wife
to her

it gave her no avail , without whose

FREEHOLDS
NOT
OF INHERITANCE.
Its origin.
The law of dower having
been recently
much changed
by the
legislature
(m) , it is necessary to distinguish the
case of widows
who were married on or before the 1st of
January , 1834 , whose rights were unaffected by the statute ,
from that of those who were married
after that date , who
come under the operation of the new law.
The
statute
extends to gavelkind
lands (n) , and it is presumed to those
held in borough English , but not to copyhold lands (0) ; we
will therefore examine the origin and rules of the ancient
law, which though rapidly losing its practical
importance ,
cannot yet be treated
as
obsolete ,
and afterwards
show
what modifications
the legislature has introduced .
Dower is called in Latin by the foreign jurists doarium ,
but by Bracton
and our English writers
dos : which among
the
Romans
signified
the
marriage
portion , which
the
wife brought to her husband ; but with us is applied
to
signify this kind of estate , to which
the civil law, in its
original
state , had nothing
that
bore a resemblance
; nor
indeed is there anything
in general
more different , than
the regulation of landed property according to the English
and Roman laws .
Dower out of lands seems also to have
been unknown in the early part of our Saxon constitution
;
for, in the laws of king Edmund (p) , the wife is directed
to be supported wholly out of the personal estate .
After-
wards , as we have
seen , in gavelkind
tenure , the widow
became entitled
to a conditional
estate in one half of the
lands with
a proviso
that
she remained chaste and un-
married ;
this
condition
is
common
also
in
copyhold
dowers, or free-bench .
Yet some (9) have ascribed the
introduction
of dower to the
Normans ,
as
a branch
of
their local
tenures ; though
we cannot expect any feudal
reason for its invention , since it was not a part of the
pure, primitive , simple law of feuds, but was first
of all

introduced
into that system
(wherein it was called triens
tertia (r) and dotalitium ) by the emperor Frederick II. (s) ;
who was contemporary with our king Henry III.
It is
possible, therefore , that it might be with us the relic of a
Danish custom
since, according to the historians of that
country , dower was introduced
into Denmark by Sweyn ,
the father of our Canute the Great , out of gratitude
to the
Danish
ladies , who sold all their jewels
to ransom him
when taken
prisoner
by the
Vandals
(t) .
However
this
be, the reason which
our law gives for adopting it is a
very plain and
sensible
one ; for the sustenance of the
wife,
and the
nurture
and
education
of the
younger
children (u).
In treating of this estate, let us consider , 1st , who may
be endowed ; 2ndly, of what she may be endowed ; 3rdly ,
the manner how she shall
be endowed ; and 4thly, how

FREEHOLDS
NOT
OF INHERITANCE .
It was formerly
thought
that the wife of an idiot might
be endowed, though
the husband of an idiot could not be
tenant by the curtesy (c) : but , as an idiot cannot marry ,
being
incapable of consenting to any contract , this doc-
trine
has
in fact
no application (d) .
By the ancient law
the wife of a person attainted of treason or of felony could
not be endowed ; to the intent , says
Staunforde (e), that
if the love of a man's own life cannot
restrain him from
such atrocious acts , the love of his wife and children
may ;
though Britton (f) gives it another turn : viz . that it is
presumed the
wife
was privy to her
husband's
crime .
However , the statute
1 Edw . 6 , c. 12 , abated the rigour
of the common law in this particular , and
allowed
the
wife her dower.
But a subsequent statute (g) revived this
severity
against
the widows
of traitors ,
who
are
now
barred of their dower (except in the case of certain modern
treasons relating
to the coin ( ) ) ,
but
not
against
the
widows of felons .
Formerly also an alien could not be en-
dowed (1), unless
she were queen consort , on the principle
cessio mirabilis
et inaudita, it was
decided in Parliament
, a few
years
after the
statute
was
enacted , not-
withstanding
the
purgation
of the
adultery in the spiritual court , that
the wife
was not entitled
to dower .
(2 Inst . 435. )
This is
an indict-
able
offence, being
a great
public
misdemeanor .
Moreover ,
conduct
on the part of the
husband
is no
excuse for adultery
on
the
wife's
part, and therefore
she even in this
case loses her dower .

We are next
to
inquire
of
what
a

may
be
en-
of
what

Herein
is
the great difference between the present

and the
ancient
law of dower
.
A
widow
not coming
within the act
is
entitled to be endowed of all lands tene-

was

any time during the coverture
,
and
of
which any issue which
she might have had might
by
possibility
have been heir

).
There
is
,
it
may
be
observed
,
no necessity like that
in
the case
of
curtesy that
any heritable issue should
have been born
.
Therefore
,
if
a
man
,
seised
in

,
had
a
son by his first wife
,
and afterwards
married
a
second wife
,
she could be en-

was no dower of
an equitable

We may here
notice
a
case
of
some
importance , in Under
the
which
the widow
,
whose rights we are describing
,
never
entitled
to
dower
;
she
had
no
claim
to
dower
of
an equitable
estate
(a).
This
is
,
we may re-
member
,
contrary
to
what
obtains
in
a
like case
as
to
a
husband's
curtesy
.
The
reason
(
not
a
very
satisfactory
one
)
which has been
assigned for there being no dower of
an
equitable
estate
is
that
at
common law she had no
dower
of
a
use
,
and courts
of
equity
in
conformity
with
this rule
of
uses
out
of
which equitable
estates
sprung
,
refused to allow her to claim dower
:
but inasmuch
as the
doctrine
has been extended
to
equitable estates
not arising
out
of
uses
,
for instance
so
as
to
deprive
her
of
dower
if
the estate happened
to
be mortgaged
,
in
which
case the
husband had merely an equity
of
redemption
in
place
of
a
legal estate

there was often considerable hardship

Changes
introduced
has
accordingly ,
as
we
shall
see ,
been
remedied
by
the act.
The other
principal
inconvenience
arising out of the
ancient law was
the
peculiarity
of the widow's
dower
attaching , notwithstanding
that the husband
had parted
with the land before his death (c).
Therefore dower could
never be released without
the expensive process of a fine ,
and cannot now (when governed by the old law) be released
during the husband's life, except by a deed acknowledged
by the wife pursuant
to the Fines and
Recoveries Abo-
lition Act.
Let us now see what
changes the act we have alluded
by the
act
.
to
introduced
into the law
of
dower
.
In the first place
the
widow's
right
to
dower
is
extended
to
equitable
estates
(d),
so
that the
widow
of
a
husband
,
entitled
to
any
equitable
interest
in
land
equal
to
an estate
of
inheritance
in
possession
,
is
entitled
in
a
court of equity
to dower out of such land
.
Next the act
provides
(e)
that
a
right
of
entry
or
action
only
shall
give
the
widow
a
title
to
dower
,
although
the
husband
shall
not
have
recovered
possession
of
the
land
,
provided
that she
sues
for the
dower within the period
during
which
such right
of
entry
or
action might
have
been
enforced
.
This gain on the part
of
the wife
is
,
however
,
more than
compensated by the power which
is
given
to
the husband
of
preventing the widow enjoying her right
.
For no widow
coming
within the act
(f
)
can be endowed of any land
(
which word includes all hereditaments
,
whether corporeal
or
incorporeal
,
except such
as
are not liable
to
dower

)),

dower

which shall have been disposed of by her husband
in his
life-time ,
or by his will (
) .
Moreover
all
partial
dis-
positions , such
as mortgages
or contracts
made by the
husband , and
even his debts ,
shall
be good against
her
dower ( ) .
Her dower may be barred by any declaration.
that his widow shall not be entitled to dower made by the
husband either in the deed by which lands have been
con-
veyed
by him, or in any deed (k) , or even in his will ( 1) :
and her right to dower may be subjected to any restric-
tions which he may impose by his will (m) , and lastly a
devise
of any land
or any
interest
in any land out of
which she might have been endowed , to her
or for
her
benefit , will bar her dower not only of that but of all his
other land,
unless
a contrary
intention
shall be declared
by his will (n).
Thus it appears that the wife's title to
dower is put absolutely within the control of her husband ,
and now she can only be endowed out of lands of which he
has died intestate and concerning which
he has made no
declaration
against
her dower .
And her dower even of
these lands may be lost by a devise to her of some interest
in other lands (o).

We proceed to consider
the
method
of endowment , Common-
or assigning
dower.
By the old
law, grounded
on the ments,
feudal exactions , a woman could not be endowed without
a fine paid
to the
lord ; neither
could she marry
again
without his licence ; lest she should contract
herself , and

(0) It has been held that a con-
veyance made prior to 1834 to the
old uses to bar dower (as to which ,
see page 267), with an express de-
claration
that
the
intention
was
that the purchaser's
then present or
any future
wife should
not
be en-
dowed , did not as against the heir-
at -law bar the dower
of
a second
wife
married
subsequently
to
the
act.

In
other
words
the
declaration
against
dower
must
be in a deed
executed
subsequently
to the
act .
By s. 14 the same
necessity
exists
as to the will (dealing with dower )

so convey part of the feud to the lord's enemy ( p) .
This
licence the lords took
care to be well paid for ; and , as it
seems , would
sometimes
force
the
dowager
to a second
marriage , in order to gain the fine.
But to remedy these
oppressions , it was
provided ,
first
by the
charter
of
Henry I. (4) , and afterwards by magna
carta (r) , that the
widow shall pay nothing for her marriage ( s) , nor shall
be
distreined to marry afresh , if she chooses
to live without a
husband , but shall not, however , marry against
the con-
sent of the lord ; and farther , that nothing
shall
be taken
for assignment of the widow's
dower , but that
she
shall
remain in her husband's
capital
mansion -house for forty
days after his death , during which time
her
dower
shall
be
assigned .
These
forty days are called
the widow's
quarentaine ;
a term made use of in law to signify the
number of forty
days , whether applied to this occasion , or
any other (t) .
The particular lands , to be held in dower ,
must be assigned (u) by the heir of the husband ,
or his
guardian ; not only for the sake of notoriety , but
also to
entitle
the
lord of the fee to demand
his
services of the
heir , in respect of the lands so holden .
For the heir by
this
entry becomes
tenant
thereof
to the lord ,
and the
widow is immediate tenant to the heir , by a kind of sub-
infeudation
or under
tenancy
completed by this
inves-
titure
or assignment
; which tenure may still be created ,
notwithstanding
the statute of quia emptores , because
the
heir parts not with the fee simple , but only with an estate
for life. If the heir
or his guardian
do not assign her
dower within
the
term
of quarentaine ,

at law and the
sheriff
is
appointed
to

Or if the heir (being under
age ) or his guardian
assign more than she ought to have ,
it may be afterwards remedied by writ of admeasurement
of dower (y). If the thing of which
she is endowed be
divisible , her dower must be set out by metes and bounds ;
but if it be indivisible, she must be endowed specially ; as

remedy.
A suit in
equity is now the
more usual mode of the suit in
widow's
asserting
her right to dower when disputed , the the usual
costs of which , if her
claim
be improperly
resisted ,
are
thrown upon the person so acting , though where there is
no improper
resistance
each party pays his own costs (a) .
Tenanoy in dower ,
even
before the
alteration
of the
law by the recent statute was not very common , for upon
preconcerted
marriages
and in estates
of
considerable
importance , the rights which
the wife
should enjoy as a
widow , in
respect
of
her
husband's
lands , were usually
provided
for by a settlement .
This leads us to consider
the methods by which dower may be barred or prevented ,
-a subject much more important
formerly than it is now.
A widow may be barred of her
dower not only by elope-
ment , divorce , the treason of her husband , and other dis-
abilities
before
mentioned (b) ,
but
also temporarily

detaining the title

of the estate from
the heir, until
she restores them (c).
By the statute of
Gloucester (d) , if a dowager aliened the land assigned her
for dower , she forfeited it ipso facto , and the heir might
recover it by action (e) .
But now an attempted alienation
only carries
the
estate
for life of the dowager , and
no
forfeiture
ensues .
A woman also might be barred of her
dower , by levying
a fine , or suffering
a recovery of the
lands , during her coverture (f) , when fines and recoveries
were in use ; and now a wife , who was married on the 1st
January ,
1834 , whose dower it is desired
to bar ,
may
effect that object by a deed duly acknowledged
by her .
But the
most
usual method of barring dowers for a long
time
was by
jointures ,
as regulated by the

by sir
Edward Coke (g) : " a competent livelihood

to take effect , in
profit
or possession , presently
after the death
of
the
husband ; for the life of the wife at least."

not where a gift or feoff-

dower ; for, in that
case, he in the
reversion
might
enter
for the for-
feiture , and avoid
the estate.
But
the mischief was, that
when
the
feoffee, or any
other , died
seised,
whereby
the
entry

was
taken
away , he in
the

could
have
no writ

after the decease of tenant in dower ,

ESTATE
IN JOINTURE .
263
tion is framed from the purview of the statute 27 Hen. 8,
c. 10 , before mentioned , commonly
called
the
statute of
uses , of which we shall speak fully hereafter .
At present
we have only
to observe , that before the making of that
statute, the greatest part of the land of England was con-
veyed to uses ; the property or possession of the soil being
vested in one man , and the use , or profits thereof , in another ;
whose directions , with regard to the disposition
thereof ,
the former was in conscience obliged to follow, and might
be compelled
by a court of equity
to
observe .
Now,
though
a husband
had the use of lands in absolute fee-
simple , yet the wife was not entitled to any dower therein :
he not being seised
thereof : therefore it became usual , on
marriage , to settle by express
deed
some special
estate
to the use of the husband and his wife , for their lives , in
joint- tenancy , or jointure : which settlement would
be a
provision for the wife in case she survived her husband .
At length the statute of uses
ordained , that such as had
the use of lands
should , to all intents and purposes , be
reputed and taken to be absolutely
seised
and possessed of
the soil itself.
In
consequence
of which legal seisin , all
wives would have become
dowable of such lands
as were
held to the use of their husbands , and also entitled at the
same
time to
any
special
lands
that might be held in
jointure
had
not the same statute
provided
that upon
making
such
an
estate
in jointure to the wife
before
marriage ,
she
shall
be for
ever
precluded
from
her
dower (h).
But
then
these
four
requisites
must

take effect (i) immediately
on the death of the husband .
2. It must be for her own life at least , and not pur autre

or

Although the
estate must be
in
point of quantity
for
her
life
,
yet
it
may be such
as
may
be
deter-
mined
sooner
by
her
own
act
.
Thus
,
an

is

,
because unless

herself
,
it

3. It must
be made to herself , and no other in trust for
her-though this condition
is not very material , as courts
of equity will uphold
as a good jointure
a limitation of an
equitable
estate (m ) .
4. It must
be made, and so in the
deed particularly expressed
to be ( n ) , in satisfaction of her
whole
dower , and not any particular
part of it.
If the
jointure be made to her after marriage , she has her elec-
tion after her husband's
death , and may either accept it
or refuse it, and betake herself
to her dower at common
law ;
for she was not capable of consenting to it during
coverture (o) .
And if, by any fraud or accident , a jointure
though made before marriage proves to be on a bad title ,
and the jointress
is evicted, or turned out of possession , she
shall then (by the provisions of the same statute ) have her
dower pro tanto at the common law.
Though
even in this
case and notwithstanding
the
statute , if the wife
was of
full
age when she married , she will be held , in a court of
equity , bound by the contract then made by her (p) .
We
may notice that dower may also be barred even when at
the time of marriage
the wife
is an infant , by a settle-
ment made, with that object , of personal property (q) .

Tenant in dower by the old common law was
subject to no tolls or taxes ; and hers is almost the only
estate on which , when derived from the king's debtor , the
king cannot
distrain
for rent , if
contracted during the
coverture (r) .

of proceeding , is necessary to compel a legal assignment of
dower ( s).
And , what is more , though dower be forfeited
by the treason of the husband , yet lands settled in jointure
remain
unimpeached
to
the
widow (t).
Moreover ,
a
jointure
is
not

of the wife , as

These
settlements ,
previous
to
marriage , seem to have been in use
among the ancient
Germans , and
their kindred nation the Gauls .
Of
the
former
Tacitus
gives
us this
account : " Dolem non uxor marito ,
sed uxori maritus
affert ; intersunt
parentes
et propinqui ,
et
munera
probant." (De Mor. Germ . c. 18. )
And
Cæsar (de Bello
Gallico , 1. 6,
c. 18) has given us the terms of a
marriage
settlement
among
the
Gauls , as nicely calculated
as any
modern jointure : " Viri ,
quantas
pecunias
ab uxoribus
dotis
nomine
acceperunt,
tantas
ex
suis
bonis,
æstimatione factâ, cum dotibus com-
municant .

The
dauphin's
commentator
on
Cæsar
supposes that this
Gaulish
custom
was the ground of the new
regula .
tions
made by Justinian
(Nov.
97)
with
regard to the
provision
for
widows
among
the
Romans
; but
surely there
is
as much
reason to
suppose , that it gave the hint for
our statutable
jointures .

that
she has
separated herself
from him and
lived
in
adultery ( u).
Besides the
method of barring dower by jointure
or
settlement , a widow might be, and often was, practically
deprived of her specific claim for dower by her husband's
will even before the statute : for if he by his will gave her
any benefits which , either by clear expression or necessary
implication
, were intended
to be in lieu of her dower , a
court of equity would
restrain
her from both taking the
benefits under the will and claiming
the dower .
She was
put to her election which she would take (x).
A jointure then , or, what is equivalent in
its effect , a
settlement
upon
the wife with the
intention
of barring
her right to dower , has long been in use , to
such
an
extent that
few widows
have been
able to claim
dower
under their general right .
But inasmuch as , in order to
establish
a free
power of alienation
of his lands , it was
necessary (before the statute ) for a married
man to show
that by some of these
methods
his wife
was barred of
her dower, a necessity which
was no inconsiderable
clog
upon his title, it became desirable
that upon purchasing
an
estate of inheritance
some
means
should
be devised
whereby the property could be
conveyed
to him so as to
be under his absolute disposal , and yet that the right of
dower
should
not attach .
Various
modes were formerly

question in these
cases is whether
the testator meant to give away his

dower , which he
could
not
do directly.
For that it
must
be
seen clearly that he meant to dis-
pose,
so that if she should
claim
dower , it
would

MODE
OF
BARRING
DOWER .
267
Uses to bar
in use for this purpose .
Sometimes the estate was con-
veyed to a trustee
for the purchaser , in which
case , as we
have
seen , the widow could
claim
no dower : but
this
method
was
not
much
liked ,
inasmuch
as
a
natural
objection existed
to giving a third person any power by
being seised of the legal estate.
Another
method
was to
have
the land conveyed
to the purchaser and another as
joint tenants , the interest
of the other being
merely
a
trust for the purchaser .
In this case , so long as the joint.
tenancy existed , the wife
could not be endowed , but , as
the
trustee
might die
before
the
husband ,
the
latter
might
become
solely
seised,
and
the
dower
would
attach .
The method was therefore imperfect , in addition
to having
the same objection
as in the previous
method
of the legal
estate
being
vested in a trustee.
At last , a
method
was invented (y) which
was free from all objec-
tion, which was as follows :-To limit a life estate to the
purchaser , and after the determination
of this
estate , by dower.
forfeiture
or otherwise , a remainder was limited
to trus-
tees during the life of the purchaser in trust for him , and
after his death
a remainder
in fee was
given
to him.
This method of limitation will be better understood
here-
after
when we treat of remainders ; it will be sufficient
here to observe , that the intermediate
remainder to the
trustee , however little likely to have any operation , was
considered sufficient to prevent his having at any moment
during his lifetime a fee simple in possession , and there-
fore his wife
could
claim
no dower (2).
The last im-
provement
to this scheme
was to give the husband , by the
aid of the statute of uses , a power of appointing
the fee
simple in such manner
as he might please in priority to
his
own life interest
and the remainders .
The mode by
which this took effect will be understood when we shall
have considered the operation of powers (a).
This method of conveying property to uses to bar dower

was settled by Mr. Fearne .

Estate pur

(as it was called) became general , and is still the daily
practice
on conveyance of property
to
a
married
man
whose marriage took place on or before the 1st of January ,
1834.
It is obvious that
no
necessity
arises for
the
adoption of any such method where the marriage of the
purchaser has taken place since that date, and indeed
the
limitation to
uses to bar dower would
not in that
case
effect
their
object (b) . If it be desired by a purchaser
coming
within
the
act to
prevent
his wife having her
dower against his heir
in
case
of his
own intestacy , on
which alone, as we have seen , the wife could claim (a not
very reasonable desire it may be thought ) , by inserting a
simple
declaration
in the
purchase
deed , he
effectually
debars her .
We mentioned at the beginning of this chapter the case
of a life estate , held not for the life of the tenant
but of
some other
person , called
an
estate
pur
autre
vie,
the
person for whose life it is held
being called
cestui que vic.
This estate , since it may determine before the death of the
tenant
for life , is considered in law to be inferior to an
estate for his own life , and yet it may prove to be more valu-
able, for the cestui
que vie , or the person for whose life the
estate is holden , may outlive the tenant .
The estate may
be limited
to a man and his heirs , or to a man without
any
addition of words of limitation , or in various
other
modes.
Formerly
much
importance
was
attached
to
these modes of limitation . If the estate were granted to
a man without
words of limitation , he could
not take
an
interest to endure longer than
his own life, and therefore
during the interval
between the death of the grantee and
that of the cestui
que vic, there was no person entitled , as
the grantor
having
parted with his property for the whole
period
of the life of the
cestui
que vie , had
no right
to
enter, and
no one
was
entitled
under
the grant ; he ,
therefore , who first entered upon
the land might
retain

possession
until
the
cestui
que vie died , and
was
called
general occupant .
This seems
to have
been recurring
to first principles ,
and calling in the law of nature to ascertain the property
of the land , when
left without
a legal owner.
For it did
not revert to the grantor , though it formerly
(c) was sup-
posed so to do ; for he had parted with all his interest , so
long as cestui que
vie
lived
:
it
did
not escheat
to
the lord
of
the fee
,
for all escheats
must be of the absolute entire
fee
,
and not
of
any particular
estate carved out
of
it
:
much less of so minute
a
remnant
as
this
:
it
did
not
belong
to
the grantee
;
for he was dead
:
it
did
not de-
scend
to
his heirs
;
for there were no words
of
inheritance
in
the grant
:
nor could
it
vest
in
his
executors
;
for no
executors
could
succeed
to
a
freehold
.
Belonging
there-
fore
to
nobody
,
like the hæreditas jacens
of
the Romans
,
the law left
it
open
to
be
seized
and appropriated
by
the
first person that could enter upon
it
,
during
the life
of
cestui que vie
,
under the name
of
an
occupant
.
But there
was no right
of
occupancy allowed
,
where the king had
the reversion
of
the lands
;
for
a
special privilege
,
that
of
treating the grant
as
at
an
end
,
was
,
in
this
as
in
many
other similar instances
,
given
to
,
or
at
least
successfully
claimed by the crown

however

the heir might

, except
that the owner
may
bar the entail and dispose of the

Act(e).
This theory of common occupancy could have no appli-
cation to incorporeal
hereditaments , as rents , advowsons ,
commons , or the like (f), because there could be no actual
entry upon such
species
of property .
Originally , there-
fore, a grant pur autre vie of such hereditaments seems to
have been thought absolutely to determine on the death of
the grantee , unless it were limited to heirs or some other
persons, who by virtue
of the grant might take posses-
sion (g).
That the possession of the heir was recognised
as
lawful
seems
rather
contradictory
to the theory
of
special
occupancy , but he was ,
nevertheless ,
called
a
special occupant .
We may here observe that there can

be no occupancy of a trust estate , for the trustee
is , of
necessity, in possession (h) .
The doctrine of occupancy has been much modified by
successive
statutory enactments : the first () gave the tenant
pur autre vie power to devise the
estate when there was
no special occupant , and directed that , in default of such
devise , it should go to his executors , or administrators
,
and be
assets in their
hands for payment of the debts of
the deceased
tenant.
The next statute (k) gave to the tenant pur autre vie an
unrestricted
power of devising the estate . It also rendered
the
estate ,
when not
devised, but in the hands of the
heir
as a special occupant , liable as assets by
descent to
the same extent as lands in fee simple .
Further , it made
the
estate , in
case
of there being
no special
occupant ,
assets in the hands of the executor or administrator
, to
be administered
not only in payment of debts , but in all
respects
as other
personal
estates .
A still later
act (1)
has re-enacted
these
provisions , giving both ample power
of devising the estate and providing
for intestacy in every
possible case (m). It has, moreover , removed all questions
arising where the
subject of the
estate is an incorporeal
hereditament , by declaring
that estates
pur

these shall
also , where there is no special
occupant , go
to the executor or administrator
, in order to be distributed
by him.

an exact number
of days.
In order to
satisfy
as far as
was practicable these conditions , it is ordained by law (d)
that
every year , except bissextile
or
leap -years ,
should
contain 365 days , and that leap-years should
contain
366
days, the additional day being , it is almost needless to add ,
the 29th of February .
Leap -years , moreover , occur every
fourth year, i.e. in every year the name of which

the years which are divisible by 100 are not
leap-years

The law takes
no
account of fractions of a day , therefore half an ordinary
year consists only of 182
days (e) ;
so a quarter of a year
consists of 91
days only , the extra
6 or

rejected (f) : though where justice

means four
weeks .
A lease for " twelve months " is only for forty-
eight weeks ; though if the expression used be " a twelve-
month " in the singular
number , it is
good
for the
whole year (m) .
The word " twelvemonth " being uni-
versally intended to mean a year , no ambiguity
can arise
in interpreting
it .
The exceptions
to this general
rule
are , first, in quare
impedit,
and in
ecclesiastical
cases
generally (n) ;
se-
condly , in
commercial
matters ,
in
which

"It is not neces-

should
rather
think it would be
more
easy to
maintain , that the

ought
in all cases to

that it should
in all
cases be in-
cluded.
Our law rejects
fractions
of a day
more
generally
than the
civil law
does.
The
effect is
to
render the day a sort of indivisible
point , so that any act done in the
compass of it is no more
referrible
to any one than to any
other
por-
tion of it ; but the act and the day
are
co-extensive
;
and
therefore ,
the act cannot
properly
be said to
be passed until
the day is passed.
But it is not necessary to lay down
any general
rule.
Whichever
way
it should be laid down , cases would

or husbandmen , who every year rendered some equivalent
in money , provisions , or other rent , to the lessors
or land-
lords , but, in order to encourage
them
to manure
and
cultivate
the
ground , they
had
a
permanent
interest
granted
them , not determinable
at the will of the lord .
And yet their possession was esteemed
of so little
conse-
quence , that they were rather considered as the bailiffs or
servants of the lord , who were to receive
and account for
the profits
at a settled price , than
as having
any property
of their
own .
And
therefore
they
were not allowed
to
have a freehold estate : but their
interest (such as it was)
vested after
their
deaths in their executors , who were to
make up the accounts of their testator with the lord , and
the other creditors , and were entitled
to the stock upon
the farm .
The lessee's
estate
might also, by the ancient
law, be
at
any
time
defeated
by
a common
recovery
suffered by the tenant of the freehold (s) ; which annihi-
lated all leases for years then subsisting , unless afterwards
renewed by the recoveror , whose title was supposed supe-
rior to his by whom those leases were granted .
While
estates
for years were thus
precarious , it is no
wonder that they were usually very short , like our modern
leases

the ancient law no leases
for more than forty years were
allowable , because

Yet this law, if ever it existed , was soon antiquated ; for
we may observe
in Madox's
collection of ancient instru-
ments , some leases
for years of a pretty early date , which
considerably
exceed
that
period
(u) :
and long terms , for
three hundred
or a thousand
years , were certainly in use
in the time of Edward III. (x) , and probably of Edward
I.
(y).
But certainly , when by the statute

years
as J. S. shall
live , is void from
the beginning
(c) ;
for it is neither certain , nor can ever be reduced
to a cer-
tainty, during the
continuance
of the
lease .
And
the
same doctrine holds , if a parson make a lease of his glebe
for so many years
as he shall continue
parson of Dale ;
for this is still more uncertain .
But a lease for twenty or
more years , if J.
S. shall
so long
live , or if he should so
long continue
parson , is good (d) ; for there is a certain
period
fixed , beyond which it cannot last ; though it may
determine sooner, on the death of J.
S. , or his ceasing to
be parson there (e) .
We have before remarked , and endeavoured to assign
the reason of, the inferiority in which the law places an
estate
for years , when
compared with an estate for life ,
or
an
inheritance
:
observing , that
an
estate
for life,
even if it be pur
autre
vie , is
a freehold : but that an
estate for a thousand years is only a chattel , and reckoned
part of the personal
estate (f).
Hence it follows , that a
lease for
years
may be
made
to commence in futuro ,
though
a
lease
for life cannot .
As , if A. grants
lands
to B. to hold from Michaelmas
next for twenty
years ,
Though no this is good ; but to hold from Michaelmas
next for the
term of his natural life, it is void . For no estate of freehold
can commence in futuro;
because it could
not be created
at common law without livery of seisin ,
or corporal
pos-
session of the land ;
and corporal
possession
cannot be
given of an
estate
now , which is not to commence now ,
but hereafter (g) , unless
indeed the freehold
estate
is to
commence
at the
expiration
of other
freehold
estates
already limited , the first of which commences in posses-
sion , for then it takes
effect as a remainder , of which we
shall
hereafter
see more (h) .
And
because
no livery
of
date of the delivery
of the
lease is
taken ; but if an
uncertain
time ,
as, the month
without the
year , is
specified , the
lease is
void.

seisin is necessary
to a lease
for years , such
lessee is not
said to be seised , or to have true legal seisin of the lands .
Nor indeed does
the bare lease vest any
estate
in
the Interesso
lessee ; but only gives him a right of entry on the tene-
ment , which right is called his interest in the
term , or
interesse
termini : but when
he has actually
so entered ,
and thereby accepted
the grant , the estate is then , and
not before, vested
in him, and he is possessed
, not pro-
perly of the land , but of the term of years ( ) ; the posses-
sion or seisin of the land remaining
still in him who has
the freehold (k).
But even
before actual entry the lessee
has many rights of property under the lease , for he may
assign his interest
or may validly grant an underlease :
and his assignee or under -lessee
may by entry complete
the title as effectually
as he could
have done by his own
entry () .
Again , if the lessee
died
before
entry ,
the
interesse termini passed
to his executors (m ).
between
time.
The word term , then , does not merely signify
the time Difference
specified in the lease , but the estate also and interest that term and
passes
by the lease : and therefore the term
may expire ,
during the continuance of the time ;
as by surrender , for-
feiture , and the like. For which reason, if A. grant a lease
to B. for the term of three years , and after the expiration
estates of freehold , is daily evaded
by the aid of the Statute
of Uses.
(i) Co. Litt . 46.
(k) " To many purposes he is not
tenant
for
years until
he
enter ;
as a release made to him is not
good to increase
his
estate
before
entry , but he may release the
rent
reserved before entry , in respect of
the privity ."
See Co. Litt. 270 a.
"Neither can the lessor grant away
the
reversion
by the name of the
reversion
before
entry .
But
the
lessee before entry hath an interest ,
interesse termini, grantable
to an-
other .
And albeit
the
lessor
die
before
the
lessee
enter , yet the
lessee
may
enter
into
the
lands .
And
so, if the
lessee dieth
before
he enter ,
yet his executors
or ad-
ministrators
may enter , because he
presently by the lease hath an inte
rest in him , and if it be made to
two , and
one die before
entry , his
interest
shall survive ."

custom , that the tenancy is from year to year , that is to
say, a tenancy which, until determined
by notice
or sur-
render , is impliedly renewed at
the
commencement
of
each year , and can be determined at the option of either
party , but only on the anniversary of the day on which it
commenced , and after half a year's previous
notice (a).
Thus , if A.
on the
1st of August enters upon
land
as
tenant of B. the owner , and on or after the 1st November
pays 107.
as a quarter's rent up to November , these facts
alone , without further
evidence, will establish
a
tenancy
from
year to year , commencing
on the
1st of August
;
and
since such
a
tenancy
can only be
determined
by
giving
a half
year's
notice , to
terminate
on the
31st
July,
therefore if no
notice
be
given
on the
1st of
February after the first commencement of the tenancy , it
will continue for two whole years at least , and so on in
other years (b).
Of course the parties may at their plea-
sure, by contract , vary the terms of the tenancy (c).
And
in certain places custom has established
a variation .
By
the custom of London
a quarter's notice is sufficient where
the rent is
less
than

When the letting is ex-
pressly for a shorter
period
than
a year , by the
quarter ,
month , or week , if the tenancy continue beyond
the first
period , then a notice equal to the period of the letting is
requisite in order
to
determine the tenancy (e).

The second
species of estates
not freehold are estates
at Estates at
will .
An estate at will is where lands and tenements are
let by one man to another , to have and to hold at the will
of the lessor ; and the tenant by force of this lease obtains
possession (i) .
Such
tenant
has no certain
indefeasible
estate, nothing
that can be assigned by him to any other ;
because the lessor
may determine his will , and put him
out whenever he pleases.
But
every
estate
at will is at
the will of both
parties ,
landlord
and
tenant ;
so that
either of them
may determine his will , and quit his con-
nexions with the other at his own
pleasure (k).

ESTATES
LESS

.
Emble
ments.
Determina-
tion of the
will .
must
be understood
with some restriction .
For , if the
tenant at will sows
his land, and the landlord , before the
corn is ripe , or before it is reaped , puts him out , yet the
tenant
shall
have
the
emblements ,
and
free
ingress ,
egress , and regress , to cut and carry away the profits (n) .
And this for the same
reason , upon which all the cases
of
emblements
turn ; viz . the point of uncertainty :
since
the
tenant
could
not possibly
know when
his landlord
would
determine his will, and therefore
could
make
no
provision
against it ; and having
sown the land , which is
for the good of the public , upon a reasonable presumption
,
the law will not suffer him to be a loser by it.
But it is
otherwise ,
and
upon
reason
equally
good ,
where
the
tenant himself determines the will ; for in this
case the
landlord
shall have the profits of the land (0).
What act does , or does not , amount to a determination
of the will on either
side , has formerly
been
matter
of
great
debate in our courts .
But it is now settled , that
(besides the express
determination
of the lessor's will, by
declaring that the lessee shall hold no longer ; which must
either
be made upon the land (p), or notice
must be
given to the lessee (q)) the exertion of any act of owner-
ship by the lessor ,
as
entering
upon the premises
and
cutting
timber (r) , taking a distress
for
rent
and im-
pounding it thereon (s) , or making
a feoffment , or
lease
for years of the land to commence immediately (t) , or any
act of desertion by the
lessee , as
assigning
his
estate to
another , or committing
waste, which
is an
act
incon-
sistent with such a tenure (u) ; or which is instar omnium ,
the death or outlawry of either
lessor
or lessee (x) : puts
an end to or determines the estate at will.

ESTATES
AT WILL .
287
The law is, however , careful , that no sudden determina-
tion of the will by one party
shall
tend to the manifest
and unforeseen
prejudice
of the
other .
This appears in
the case of
emblements
before
mentioned ;
and , by a
parity of reason , the
lessee , after
the
determination
of
the lessor's will , shall have reasonable ingress and
egress
to fetch away his goods and utensils , and to remove his
fixtures (y).
And ,
upon the same principle ,
courts of
law have of
late
years
leaned
as
much
as
possible
against
construing
demises,
where
no
certain
term
is
mentioned
, to be tenancies at will ;
but have rather held Tenancies
them to be tenancies from year
to year
so long as both to year.
parties
please ,
especially
where
an
annual
rent
is
reserved .
Under the provisions of the Statute of Frauds (2) (an
enactment
passed for a purpose indicated by its name) , all
leases and estates made by parol , and not put in writing and
signed by the parties making the same , or their agents law-
fully thereto authorised , in writing , have the force and effect
ofleases or estates atwill only , an exception , however , being
made (a) of all leases for terms not exceeding three years
from the making thereof whereon the rent reserved
is
at
least two-thirds of the annual value .
The courts , follow-
ing the principle above
noticed , have, whilst giving effect
to the spirit of this
act, so far deviated
from
its strict
letter , as to hold
that where a lease is made by parol for
more than three years , followed by a payment of rent , or
promise
to pay rent , the tenancy is one from year to year ,
upon the terms
(except as to the duration of the lease)
contained
in the
parol
lease , and
is not
a tenancy

ESTATES
LESS
THAN FREEHOLD
.
Estates
at suffe-
rance.
Hence a tenancy at will , being , as is obvious , an incon-
venient mode of possessing land , rarely
occurs
in practice ,
except in certain cases where it exists by operation of law
rather
than by
express
intendment
of the
parties
(c) ,
and except the
large
number
of tenancies at will which
constitute
copyholds , of which we have already spoken at
some length .
They are, as will sufficiently
appear from
what
we have said , when
considered
as
estates
in law,
merely
tenancies
at will , but
being
regulated
and made
permanent by custom , it is rather in theory than in sub-
stance that they are so to be regarded (d ) .
An estate
at sufferance, is , where
one
comes
into pos-
session of land
by lawful title , but
keeps it afterwards
without any title at all.
As , if a man takes a lease for a
year , and, after the year is expired , continues to hold the
premises without
any fresh leave from the owner of the
estate.
Or, if a man
makes a lease at will and dies , the
estate at will is thereby determined
:
but if the tenant
continueth
possession , he is tenant
at
sufferance .
But
no man can be tenant
at sufferance against the king , to
whom
no laches , or neglect , in not entering
and ousting
the
tenant , is
ever
imputed
by law ; but his tenant , so
holding
over ,
is considered
as
an absolute
intruder (e).
But , in the case of a subject , this estate may be destroyed
whenever the true
owner
shall make an actual
entry on
the lands
and oust the tenant ; for , before entry , he can-
not maintain an action of trespass against the tenant by
sufferance, as
he might
against
a stranger (f) : and the
reason is , because
the tenant
being
once in by a lawful
title, the law (which presumes no wrong in any man ) will
(c) For
instance , where
a mort-
gagor remains in personal possession
of the
mortgagee
land with the
consent of the mortgagee , he is in
the eye of the law (where no express
contract exists ) a tenant
at will , but
his
equitable
rights
carry his posi-
tion substantially
far higher .

shall revert to this point presently .

suppose
him to
continue
upon
a title
equally
lawful ;
unless the owner of the land by some public and avowed
act , such
as
entry is, will
declare
his
continuance to be
tortious , or , in common language , wrongful .
A distinction
is sometimes
taken between those cases
where the tenant
comes
to the
particular
estate by act of
the parties , and where by act of law.
In the latter
case
there can be no presumption
of the owner's assent which
may exist in the former
case ( g) ;
the distinction
, what-
ever force it can have, is rarely called into consideration .
The principal
distinction
between
tenant
at will
and
tenant at sufferance is , that the landlord
in the former
case must give notice before his title to recover possession
is
complete , whereas in the latter
he may , without any
notice , bring ejectment , there being in the former
case
a privity of
contract , express
or
implied , between the
parties , but none in the latter case .
A tenant
at suffer-
ance in fact only has this privilege , that he is excused from
liability
as a trespasser in respect of his past occupation .
If the tenant
(after
due notice) do
not quit the land
when requested
to do so by the landlord , the latter may
enter forcibly into the premises
and , if necessary, use
violence (but only so
much
as is absolutely requisite ) to
expel
the
tenant , without being
liable
for
trespass or
assault (h) , though if the entry have been forcible
he may
render
himself liable
to an
indictment
(i).
The
other
remedy
is an action of ejectment , by which , under process

Bythe common law a
tenant contumaciously
holding
over after his tenancy had
expired was at the utmost liable to account for the profits
of the
land
so
detained
by him.
But by the
statute
4 Geo.
2 , c. 28 , in case
any tenant
for
life
or years ,
or other person claiming under or by collusion with such
tenant , shall wilfully (7) hold over after the determination
of the term , and demand made and notice in writing given
by him to
whom
the
remainder
or
reversion
of the
premises
shall
belong ,
for
delivering
the
possession
thereof ;
such person ,
so holding over
or
keeping
the
other out of possession , shall pay for the time he detains
the lands , at the rate of double their yearly value .
And ,
by stat .
11

case
any tenant , having
power to determine his lease , shall give
notice of his in-
tention to quit the premises , and shall not deliver up the
possession at the time contained in
such notice , he shall
thenceforth pay double the
former rent , for such time
as
he continues
in possession.
These statutes have almost
put an
end to
the
practice of
tenancy
by
sufferance ,
unless with
the tacit
consent of the
owner of the tene-
ment (m).

CHAPTER X.
ESTATES
UPON
CONDITION .
WE have hitherto
considered
estates
as
classified in
respect of their duration according to their intrinsic quali-
ties, but the law
recognizes
divers modes by which any
of these estates may themselves be held : their possession
being
qualified by some
restriction
depending
usually
upon the happening
or not happening of some uncertain
event , whereby the estate may be either originally created
or enlarged
or finally defeated (a).
Hence
arises a dis-
tinct system of classification ;
estates
being in this view
commonly called estates
upon condition , and their differ-
ence of
species
depending
upon
the
various
conditions
which regulate
their
possession .
Any
of the
former
classes
of estates , a
fee
,
or
other freehold
,
or
a
term
of
years
,
may depend upon these provisional
restrictions
.
Viewed
,
then
,
according
to
this basis
of
classification
,
estates
are
of
two
sorts
:
first
,
estates
upon
condition
implied
:
secondly
,
estates
upon

expressed
;
under which last may

;

his heirs , to oust him, and grant it to another person (c) .
For an
office , either public or private , may be forfeited
by mis -user or non -user, both of which are breaches of
this implied
condition .
1. By mis -user, or
abuse
;
as if
a judge takes a bribe , or a park -keeper kills deer without
authority .
2. By non -user,
or neglect ; which in public
offices , that
concern the
administration
of justice , or the
commonwealth , is of itself a direct
and immediate
cause
of forfeiture
; but non -user of a private
office is no cause
of forfeiture , unless some special damage is proved
to be
occasioned thereby (d).
For in the
one
case delay must
necessarily
be occasioned
in the
affairs
of the public ,
which
require
a
constant
attention
: but private
offices
not
requiring
so regular
and
unremitted
a service , the
temporary neglect of them is not necessarily productive of
mischief : upon which account some special loss must be
proved , in order to vacate these.
Franchises
also , being
regal privileges
in the hands of a subject , are held to be
granted on the same condition of making
a proper use of
them ; and therefore they may be lost
and forfeited , like
offices , either by abuse
or by neglect (e).
Upon the same principle
proceeded
all the forfeitures
which
have been given by law of life estates
and
others ,
for any
acts
done by the tenant himself, that
are in-
compatible with the estate which he holds .
As if tenants
for life or years enfeoffed a stranger in fee simple : this
was, by the
common law,
a forfeiture
of their several
estates
; being
a breach of the condition
which
the law
annexes thereto , viz . that they shall not attempt to create
a greater estate
than they themselves are entitled
to (ƒ) .

for life , or in fee, commit

the failure or non -performance of which an estate
already
vested may be defeated.
Thus , if an
estate
for life be
limited
to A. , upon his marriage with B. , the marriage is
a precedent condition , and , till that happens , no estate (¿)
is vested in A.
Or, if a man grant to his lessee for years ,
that upon payment of a hundred pounds within the term
he shall have the fee , this
also is a condition
precedent ,
and the fee simple does not pass till the hundred
pounds
be paid (k).
But , if a man grant an estate in fee simple ,
reserving to himself and his heirs a certain rent ; and that
if such rent
be not paid at the times appointed , it shall
be lawful for him and his heirs to re-enter, and avoid the
estate : in this
case
the
grantee
and his heirs
have an
estate upon
condition
subsequent , which is defeasible if
the condition be not strictly
performed ().
To this class
may also be referred
the ancient
fee simples
conditional
which
existed at the common law before the statute
de
Donis (m).
Thus , an estate to a man and his heirs , tenants
ofthe manor of Dale , is an estate on condition
that he and
his heirs
continue
tenants of that manor .
And so, if a
personal annuity be granted at this day to
a man and the
heirs of his
body ,
as this
is
no
tenement
within the
statute , it remains ,
as at common law, a fee simple
on
condition
that the grantee
has heirs of his body .
Upon
the same principle
depend all the determinable
estates of
freehold , which we mentioned in the eighth
chapter : as ,
durante viduitate, &c.:
these
are
estates
upon
condition
that the grantees
do not marry , and the like .

strict words of condition
be used in the creation of the
estate , if on breach of the condition
the estate be limited
over to a third person , and does not immediately
revert to
the
grantor
or his
representatives ,
(as if

that within two years
B. intermarry
with C. , and on failure thereof
then to D.
and his
heirs ), this the law construes to be a limitation
Between a
and not
a condition (s) :
because , if it were a condition ,
then , upon the breach thereof , since
a condition of entry
can only
be
reserved in favour
of the
grantor
and his
heirs , only A. or his representatives could avoid the estate
by entry ;
and if he
or they
entered, the
seisin
upon
which the limitation was founded would be defeated and
A.
or his

would
be in of his former

Whether, therefore , A. took advantage of the
condition
or neglected
to
do
so , the limitation
in D.'s
favour would
equally
fail .
But , when it is a limitation ,
the estate
of B. determines , and that of D. commences ,
and he may enter on the lands the instant that the failure
happens .
So also, if a man by his will devises land to
his heir at law , on condition that he pays a sum of money ,
and for non -payment
devises
it over, this shall be con-
sidered as a limitation ;

he cannot

his lease as having

his own default , until the lessor has
declared
his

material
whether
the

But of course, if

The student
should
bear in
mind , that the rules as to
condi-
tions , remainders ,
&c., laid down
in this part of the
work, have re-
ference
to
estates
subsisting
at
common law , and
do not
apply to
executory
limitations
under
the
statutes of uses and wills, of which
we shall presently
treat .


CONDITION
EXPRESSED
.
297
reversion
has same
grantor.
We
may
here
notice
that anciently , if the lessor of a Grantee of a
freehold or leasehold
estate
upon condition
granted away upon a term
his reversion , the right to
re-enter upon
breach of the rights as
condition
was gone , for the
stranger could not enter, and
the
lessor
having
parted
with
his
reversion
could
not
enter , not possessing his former
estate (x).
But , by a
statute
passed
in the
year
1540 (y) the grantee of the
reversion upon
a lease for years or for life by indenture ,
has the same power of re-entry upon breach of conditions
contained in the lease
as the lessor or his heirs (≈) .
In all these instances of limitations
or conditions sub-
sequent, it is to be observed that , so long as the condition ,
either
express or implied , either in
deed
or in law , re-
mains unbroken , the grantee may have an estate of free-
hold , provided
the estate upon
which
such condition
is
annexed
be in itself of
a freehold
nature ;
as if the
original
grant
express either an estate of inheritance , or
for life , or
no
estate at all ,
which
is
constructively
an
estate for life.
For the breach of these
conditions being
contingent
and uncertain , this uncertainty
preserves
the
freehold (a) ; because
the estate is capable to last for ever ,
or at least for the life of the tenant , supposing
the con-
dition to remain unbroken . But where the estate is at the
utmost
a chattel
interest , which must
determine
at a
time certain , and may determine
sooner, (as a grant for
ninety-nine years , provided A. , B. , and C. , or the survivor
of them , shall
so long live) , this
still
continues
a mere
chattel , and is not , by such its uncertainty , ranked among
estates of freehold .

As , if a feoffment

condition
that , unless
he

to Rome in
twenty -four hours , or unless he marries with Jane
S. by
such a day, (within which
time
the woman
dies , or the
feoffor
marries
her himself ) , or unless he kills another ,
or in case he alienes in
fee ; that then and in any of such
cases the estate shall be vacated and determined : here
the condition is void , and the estate made absolute in the
feoffee .
For
he
has by the grant
the
estate vested in
him, which shall not
be defeated
afterwards
by a con-
dition either impossible , illegal , or repugnant (b) .
But if
the condition be precedent, or to be performed before the
estate vests, as a grant to a man that , if he kills
another
or goes to Rome in a day, he shall have an estate in fee ;
here, the void condition being precedent , the estate which
depends
thereon
is also void , and the grantee shall
take
nothing
by the grant ; for he hath no estate until
the
condition
be performed (c).

some
particular
species
of estates

require , from
the practical interest attending them , more especial notice .

able to aliene it.

gage.
Upon the
former
of these ,
vivum vadium , which
is Estates in
now to a great extent
out of use , we need not dwell long .
It is where
a man borrows a sum of money and grants an
estate to the lender to hold until the rents and profits shall
repay the sum so borrowed , together with interest .
This
is an estate
conditioned
to be void
as
soon as the sum
advanced
is, together
with
interest ,
recouped
to
the
lender .
The land is said to be living because it survives
the debt,
on the
discharge
of which it
results to the
borrower (e).
A particular
form of this kind of pledge is
that called a Welsh mortgage , where the land is conveyed
Welsh mort-
to the lender who receives the rents and profits in lieu of
interest , the
borrower
retaining
the right at any time to
redeem the land on payment of the principal only .
In
this case there is
considered to be no debt on the part of
the borrower (f) .
But
as , if the
rent
be
excessive
, it
would be hard upon the borrower that no part of it should
be applied in discharge of the principal
; courts of equity
have established
that , even in the case of a Welsh mort-
gage, there shall be an account of the rents , if they be
excessive , and it has been held
that an annual
profit of
137. was excessive where the loan was only
901. ( g) .
Con-
sequently
there is not much substantial
difference between
a vivum
vadium
proper
and
a " Welsh
mortgage " (h).
Pledges
of these
kinds
are
distinguished
from
those
which we

a power to

and
hold the
lands until
the rents
and

shall have paid up all arrears of the

also distinguish

accompanied by a contract for re-purchase on certain con-
ditions .
A transaction
of this kind is , however , not very
common , and when it occurs it usually
leads to much
difficulty in determining
whether , in point of fact the in-
tention
of the
parties
was not
a mortgage , or at least
whether it is not a Welsh mortgage .
Perhaps
the dis-
tinction
between a conditional
purchase of this kind and
a Welsh mortgage , is somewhat fine ( ) , but the conten-
tion usually is , to show that the transaction was in fact a
common mortgage (k).
Mortgage.
We now come to mortuum radium , or mortgage , which
being now the common
form in which permanent
loans
are effected , is of the highest importance in a commercial
country
such as
this , where the
employment
of floating
capital
rests very
commonly
with those who
are not its
owners , and who , therefore , are driven to borrow .
The law
relating to mortgages
has passed through many stages ere
it reached its present
position .
These we will shortly
trace .
This kind of pledge is where a man borrows of another
a specific sum (e.g.
2007. ) and grants him an estate either
in fee
or for a less
period , on condition that , if he, the
borrower , or mortgagor , as he is called , or his heirs , shall
repay the mortgagee the
sum so borrowed together with
interest at the agreed
rate (1) , on a certain day mentioned

in the deed , that then the mortgagor
may re-enter on the
estate so granted in pledge (m) : the estate so granted is ,
therefore , an estate on condition
liable to determine abso-
lutely if the mortgagor , in accordance with the condition ,
repay the money at the
appointed
time ;
but , should he
fail strictly to comply with this
condition , the
estate
of
the mortgagee becomes
absolute at law, and is , therefore ,
dead to the mortgagor .
During the period between the
grant and the day fixed
for payment
the mortgagee is
called tenant in mortgage (n).
Such is the
simple
idea of a mortgage
as originally
conceived ;
some modifications
of the form
which it
assumed
were , however, early
introduced .
For
a person
having once mortgaged his land was bound afterwards , if
he would
establish
a complete title , to prove that
he had
complied with the exigency of the condition , a thing often
not easy to demonstrate , even if the fact were so .
It be-
came common , therefore , to substitute
for the conditions
defeating the estate granted , a proviso or contract that , if
the money
were repaid
on the particular
day the mort-
gagee
should
then ,
or at any
time
after , at request of
the mortgagor , re-convey the property
mortgaged
;
and
this is the form now invariably adopted . A re- conveyance
then became sufficient for the
support of the title what-
ever
were the
facts
as to the payment .
At the
same
time courts of law still held the mortgagor
as strictly as
before
to the performance
of his
condition
to the letter .
provided
for by the
deed, it was
held that the mortgage
carried
no
interest .

The
definition
or descrip-

given in the
text
must not be
taken
as
a complete
definition
of
the word mortgage as now used, for
a mortgage may
be made , not only
of land , but of any
species of pro-
perty .
No difficulty arises ,
how-
ever, on the subject ,
for the appli-
cation of the same idea to
chattels
or other
property
is not
difficult ,
being only subject
to such
further
rules of law as are specially
appli-

Equity of
redemption. This strict compliance with the exact terms of the contract
was, however , not in reality the intention
of the parties ,
and therefore courts of equity taking
a less restricted view
of their relations , and looking
to the spirit and intention
of the transaction , established the doctrine that the mort-
gagor
should
have a right at any reasonable time to re-
quire
a re-conveyance
upon
payment
of the principal
money , interest , and all expenses which
the mortgagee
might properly have incurred , thus , in fact , rendering
the
condition
little more
than a peculiar
form of stating the
nature of the transaction .
This they have declared to be a
loan of money , with, as
a collateral
security , a pledge of
the land (0)
the loan or debt being the primary
fact , the
conveyance of the
land
being
only
a means of securing
the debt from becoming a loss (p) .
Upon this principle ,
equity
declares that
a transaction
which
is once a mort-
gage shall be always a mortgage ;
which
means, that
no
contract , however explicit in
its
terms
,
shall exclude him
,
who initially
is
a
borrower and not
a
vendor
,
from redeem-
ing the property

power of the mortgagor , as to whether
there shall
be a
redemption
or not ,
for
equity
has
always
allowed
the
mortgagee to foreclose the equity of redemption (s) :
but
this
can only be done by a suit in equity , in which the
court always gives the mortgagor
a considerable period to
pay the money .
But if, after the formal
proceedings of
a chancery
suit
have been completed , and the final hour
fixed by the court
for
payment
has
passed
without
pay-
ment by the mortgagor , then the court declares that the
estate shall thenceforth
be the absolute property of the
mortgagee , and the
mortgagor
shall be foreclosed
and
barred
of his right
to redeem : but at any time
before
this final order is made , the mortgagor may pay the prin-
cipal, interest , and
costs , and obtain
a re- conveyance
(†) .
By a recent
statute the
court
is
empowered , in a fore-
closure suit, to direct
a sale of the mortgaged property ,
instead of foreclosure at the request of either party (u).
The doctrines
thus
established in a court of equity as
to the primary
importance which
is attached
to the per-
sonal debt , to
secure which a mortgage
is made ,
do
not
apply in all their completeness when the property subject
to the mortgage
has been
conveyed
away by
the mort-
gagor ;
because , in this case , the person so becoming en-
titled
cannot
be
under
any
personal
liability
to
the
mortgagee : the utmost liability which he can incur is to
indemnify the original mortgagor
against any claim made
on him
personally
by the mortgagee , and this would , of
course , depend upon the contract between them . The pro-
perty in his

But
subsequent dealings
between the alienee of the
equity of redemption
and the mortgagee may , and often
do, have the effect of casting upon the former
a personal
liability to pay the amount , and in this case the estate
is
restored to its original
position as a collateral
security (y).
We may here notice
that , by a recent act (2 ) , where a
mortgagor
dies , the heir or devisee
who
becomes
entitled
to the property subject to the mortgage takes it cum onere ,
and is not entitled to require payment of the debt out of
the personal
assets
of the deceased , unless
the

shall , by
his

the
contrary

intention (a).

a long lapse of
years to take place without asserting
his right .
There-
fore if a mortgagee were in possession of the mortgaged
premises for twenty years or more , without
giving any
acknowledgment
of the
mortgagor's

any claim being made by the mortgagor , the
court

that he should not afterwards be disturbed (b).

performance
of the con-
dition , or being redeemed

But it is not unusual to agree
that , until default shall have been made in payment , at
the time specified , the mortgagor
may retain
possession .
After this time has
passed , however , the
estate being
absolute at law, the mortgagee may enter without fear of
the mortgagor
evicting him by legal procedure (c).
This
right of entry
is
not
unfrequently
exercised
where
the
security
is of
scanty
value ,
and particularly
when
the
mortgagor
neglects
even the payment
of interest .
But
here, as in
other points , equity
gives the
mortgagor
its
careful protection
,
for
it
requires the mortgagee
to
account
most strictly for the
profits
of the land
,
not only those
which he has actually
received
,
but also those which
,
but
for his wilful default
,
he might have received
(d)
;
and he
is
bound
(

)
to
appropriate
the re-
ceipts which he has thus
to
account for
in
discharge first
of
interest
and
costs
,
and
then
of

monies

A
mortgagee
thus taking possession
is
entitled
to
receive all rents and profits accruing afterwards
,
though
of
course he has no right
to
any account
of
rents
or
pro-
fits previously
received by the mortgagor

Such were till recently the outlines of the relation be-
tween mortgagor
and mortgagee , and the rights
relative
to the mortgaged
estate , which
they respectively had by
virtue of the contract of mortgage
alone without
further
stipulations .
But it long ago became the
practice , in
by contract. addition to the rights which
we have mentioned , to give
to the mortgagee a power of selling the property
so as , in
the hands of the purchaser , to be free from all equity of
redemption (h).
This power , existing
by contract , usually
formed part of the mortgage
deed , and commonly it was
stipulated
that it should be exerciseable only after some
considerable
notice to the mortgagor
of the mortgagee's
intention
to sell .
The practical utility of this
power , ob-
viating as it did the expense of a chancery suit , has
led
to its recognition
by the legislature
; and a recent enact-
ment declares (i) that every mortgagee by deed (k ) shall ,

We may notice that it has been
decided , although perhaps
sufficiently obvious , that the power of sale which existed.
by contract
did not interfere with the mortgagee's ordi-
nary power to foreclose (m).
The same is of course
true
with respect to the statutory power of sale.
The same statute
gives to the mortgagee
a power
to
insure the property against fire , if of an insurable
nature ,
and
a power to appoint a receiver of the rents (n).

so far as may be necessary for the Possession

a ques-
tion of some interest to inquire into the exact legal
posi-
tion ofthe mortgagor whilst so in possession .
In equity
he is , in accordance
with the principles
which
we have
mentioned , considered , until foreclosure

owner
of the
property ,

to the liability
of
having it taken from him to satisfy the mortgage debt .

drawn

stipulated in the deed , he has lost his original
estate (if the
mortgage be of his whole interest ), and his legal interest ,
if any , is a tenancy under the mortgagee .
In the absence
of any special agreement ,
after the execution of a legal
mortgage , the mortgagor , so long as he retains possession ,
is tenant at sufferance
of the mortgagee
; but if there is a
general
agreement ,
either
verbal
or by writing , that he
shall retain the possession, and no term is specified , he is
tenant at will (0) .
The
mortgage
deed ,
however ,
sometimes
contains
a
stipulation
that the mortgagor shall retain the possession ,
generally
until
default
shall
be made in payment .
An
agreement of this kind is construed
as a re-demise from
the mortgagee to the mortgagor
until the
day fixed
for
payment (p).
In those
cases
where the mortgagor
is in the
actual
personal
enjoyment of the
property , it is not uncommon
for him to attorn tenant to the mortgagee at a rent equal
to the interest upon the mortgage debt , thereby giving
the
tenant
power to distrain
for the
amount of interest ; in
such a case he is either tenant at will or yearly tenant .

mortgages.
We will here add a few short remarks
upon some sub-
sidiary points relating
to mortgages , which
are of constant
and practical application .
It is not at all uncommon for Successive
the same property
to be made
subject
to a number of
successive
mortgages .
For although
the first mortgage
alone can completely fill the character of a true mortgage ,
inasmuch as that alone can confer upon the mortgagee a
legal estate ; still the equity of redemption is regarded to
such an extent as an ownership , that
a conveyance of it in
a form exactly similar to a first mortgage
is considered
to constitute
a security , having
many of the properties
and much
of the value of a first
mortgage ; except of
course this, that should the property prove
insufficient
in
value to satisfy both claims , the first mortgagee is entitled
to
a
complete
discharge
of all money
owing
upon
his
security before the second or subsequent
mortgagees
can
obtain
anything .
Where
there
are
several
mortgages
upon the same property there often arise questions as to
the
order
of priority of the
claims , which
are
of the
highest importance
to the parties .
They usually arise in
foreclosure
or redemption
suits , therefore
such questions.
have principally been
dealt with by courts of equity , and
are also from their inherent nature subject to the jurisdic-
tion of those
courts .
The
fundamental
doctrine

questions usually

which involves
a most
righteous
principle , viz ., that
a
person who takes property with notice of a prior right ,
even though he be a bona fide purchaser for valuable
con-
sideration ,
yet
he
shall
give
full
effect
to that
prior
right (8).
Where there is no duty arising
out of that good faith
which
courts of equity
require from every man , then he
who has the legal
estate is considered to have the better
equity , so that if a third mortgagee
(who lent his money
without notice of the
existence of the second mortgage )
takes a transfer of the first mortgage , thus obtaining the
legal estate , he is considered as having
a better equity than
that
of the second
mortgagee ( t).
Where ,
however ,
there is nothing
else to distinguish
the equities of various
incumbrancers , the maxim qui prior est tempore potior est
jure applies , and the incumbrances rank in the
order
of
their date (u).

mortgages.
We
cannot
leave
the
subject
of mortgages
without
Equitable
referring to those of the
peculiar
kind which
courts of
equity have sanctioned , and which are consequently called
equitable mortgages .
These , although
they do not confer
any estate either at law or in equity upon the mortgagee ,
and therefore are not properly within the scope of this chap-
ter , yet have in effect such similarity
to mortgages properly
so called, and are also of such great practical utility , that a
passing notice of them may well find a place here.
Courts
of equity have declared that if a contract can be shown to
exist that land
should be charged with the payment of a
debt ,
even
without
the
evidence of writing
(notwith-
standing the statute of Frauds) , if the title deeds of the
land be deposited with the mortgagee , or some equivalent
act done, it is a good mortgage (x).
The principle upon which the courts have sanctioned.
this proceeding is , that what has
been
agreed
to be done
shall be deemed
to be done, if the consideration
be suffi-
cient and some act of performance done, in pursuance of
the agreement : as there would
otherwise
be a breach of
good faith .
The
practice of depositing title deeds being
debt, the
mortgagee
who
first
gives notice to the
trustee , debtor ,
or other person in whose hands the
fund is,
obtains priority whatever
be the date of his
security .

ridge

Cooper,

This
does not apply to mortgages of real
estate, or chattels

property

it is to be observed that
the
notice
to be of any effectual use must
be
given to the trustee , &c., after
he
has been fully constituted
such by
having
the fund in his hands ; it
will be useless if given
merely

ration
of law, for security
and
satisfaction
of debts , is
called
an
estate
by
elegit .
Without
here entering into
detail as to what an elegit is , we may here mention , that it
is the name of a writ , founded originally on the statute (e)
of Westm .
2 , by which ,
after
a plaintiff
has
obtained
judgment for his debt at law , the sheriff gave him posses-
sion of one half of the defendant's lands and
tenements ,
to be occupied and enjoyed , until his
debt
and
damages
are fully paid
and during the time he so holds
them , he
is called tenant by elegit .
Under the act we
have
men-
tioned , the debtor
could
" extend ,"
as the phrase went,
the half of any freehold lands (
possessed
by the debtor
at the time of entering up judgment : and this right was
not lost even if the debtor
after the judgment
conveyed
away the land
to
a
purchaser
without
notice
of the
judgment .
The
remedy has by the
Statute
of Frauds ,
and
still
more by a modern
act (g) , been enlarged , so
as to render
liable the
entirety
of the
lands , whether
copyhold
or
freehold ,
to
be
extended ,
and
not
only
these
but
also all rectories , tithes , rents , or hereditaments .
More-
over,
the
restriction
as
to the legal
estate being in
the debtor is also removed , so that all these, if they be
held in trust for the debtor , or if he has any
disposing
power over them
exerciseable for his own benefit , are ex-
tendible
under an
elegit .
But
an
equity of redemption
not falling within either of the acts
is still not extendible .
Equitable
Nevertheless , courts of equity will , when the creditor has
proceeded
at law as far as possible without
success , inter-
fere to assist him, by giving him the same benefit as he
could , had the estate been legal , have had under an

CHAPTER XI.
ESTATES
IN
POSSESSION , REMAINDER
, AND
REVERSION .
HITHERTO We have considered estates
solely with regard
to their
duration , or the quantity of interest which
the
owners have therein .
We are now to consider
them in
another view ; with regard to the time of their enjoyment,
when the
actual
pernancy
of the
profits
(that
is , the
taking ,
perception ,
or
receipt of the
rents
and
other
advantages arising
therefrom ) begins .
Estates , therefore ,
with respect to this
consideration , may either be in pos-
session
or in expectancy : and of expectancies there are
two
sorts ; one
created by the act of the
parties , called
a remainder
;
the
other
by
act
of law, and
called
a
reversion .
Of
estates
in possession , (which
are sometimes
called
estates executed, whereby a present interest
passes
to and
resides in the tenant , not
depending
on any subsequent
circumstance
or contingency ,
as in the
case
of estates
executory ,) there is little or nothing
peculiar
to be
ob-
served.
All the estates
we have hitherto
spoken of are
of this kind ; for, in laying down general rules , we usually
apply them to
such
estates
as
are then
actually in the
tenants ' possession
.
But the doctrine of estates in expec-
tancy formerly
contained much , and still contains some of
the nicest and most abstruse learning in the English law .
These will therefore
require
a minute
discussion ,
and
demand some degree of attention .


ESTATES
IN
REMAINDER
.
317
remainder.
An
estate
then in remainder
may
be defined
to be, Estates in
an estate
limited
to
take
effect
and
be enjoyed
after
another estate
is determined .
As if a man seised in fee-
simple grants
lands
to A.
for his life,
and, after
the
determination
of that estate , then to B. and his heirs for
ever : here A. is tenant
for life remainder to B. in
fee .
In the first place , an
estate
for life is created
or carved
out of the
fee , and
given
to A.;
and
the
residue
or
remainder of it is given to B.
But the present life estate
and the remainder afterwards , when
added together , are
equal
only to one
estate
in
fee (a).
They
are indeed
different parts , but they constitute
only one whole : they
are carved out of one and the
same inheritance
: they are
both created , and
may both
subsist together ; the one in
possession
, the other in
expectancy .
So, if land be
granted to A. for life, and after the determination of the
said term to B. in tail ; and
after
the
determination
of
B.'s estate tail , it be limited
to C. and his heirs for ever
;
this makes
a tenant for life, with remainder to B. in tail,
remainder
over
to
C. in fee .
Now here the
estate
of
inheritance
undergoes
a division
into three portions , the
first estate , and both the remainders , together
constitute
one
entire
inheritance
:
and if there
were
a hundred
remainders , it would still be the same thing .
And hence
also it is
easy to see why no remainder
can be limited
after the
grant of an estate in fee
simple (b) :
because
a
fee-simple is the highest and largest estate that a subject
is capable of enjoying ; and he that is tenant
in fee hath
in him the whole of the estate : a remainder , therefore ,
which is only a portion , or residuary
part , of the estate ,
cannot be reserved after the whole is disposed of.
A par-
ticular estate, with all the remainders expectant thereon ,
is only one fee simple ; as 407.
is part of 100 %. , and 60 %. is
the remainder of it : wherefore , after
a
fee
simple once
vested , there can no more be a remainder limited
thereon ,

than after the whole
1007.
is appropriated
there
can be
any residue subsisting .
This doctrine
has been, as we have
seen , adopted
with
such strictness , that by the common law there cannot be
limited a remainder upon a base fee (c) , and though now,
when
an estate tail (upon which a remainder
exists ) is
converted into
a
base
fee , the
remainder
continues to
be a valid remainder
(subject of course to being
barred ) ,
yet this which
arises by operation of law, may
not be
effected
by act of the parties ; for before the
statute
De
Donis
no remainder could be limited upon
a conditional
fee (d) , and no change has been made in this rule .
We must
bear in
mind
that our
remarks
are appli-
cable only to
estates
created by conveyance at
common
law ; but by virtue of the statutes of Uses and of Wills,
estates
may , within the limits prescribed by certain rules ,
be limited with every conceivable variety of modelling (e) .
Having premised
thus
much , we
are in a position
to
discuss and comprehend the rules which are required by
the law to be observed in the creation of remainders , with
the reasons upon which these rules depend.
First, there must
be
a particular
freehold
estate
pre-
cedent to the remainder (f).
Thus , an
estate
given to
A. , to take effect after the death of B. , must be preceded
by an
estate
given
to B. for
his life, or to some
other
person for the life of B.
This precedent
estate
is
called
the
particular
estate ,
as
being
only a small
part ,
or
particula, of the inheritance
;
the
residue being
granted
over to the
remainderman
or
remaindermen .
In
one
sense , a remainder
is said
sometimes
to
exist
after
an
estate for years.
Thus , if land is granted to A. for twenty
years, and after the determination
of that estate
to B. for
life, and so on.
Since B.'s interest
does
not carry with

it the actual enjoyment of the law until after the deter-
mination of A.'s term , therefore it is sometimes described.
as a remainder ; but
inasmuch
as the feudal
seisin must
by our law be in
some person ,
and it cannot
be in a
tenant
of less than
freehold
interest ,
therefore , in the
case put , B. would
be said to be in possession for
an
estate for life , subject to the tenancy for years of A. , and ,
in fact , this is the ordinary form of such a limitation (g).
The words " and in the meantime subject thereto " usually
follow the limitation of the term .
For the livery of seisin
to A. passes it at once to B. , who is at once
seised of his
remainder
at the
same
time
that
the termor is of his
term .
The enjoyment of it must
indeed be deferred till
hereafter ; but it is to all intents
and purposes
an
estate
commencing
in
præsenti , though
to
be
occupied
and
enjoyed in futuro .
The meaning
of the rule , which
requires
a particular
precedent estate , appears also when we consider another
canon of the common law, viz . , that
an
estate
of free-
hold (h ) cannot be created
to commence in futuro (i) .
A
grant of an estate
tail to commence from the beginning
of next year
is
void .
This
arises ,
as
already
shown ,
from the fact that livery of seisin being a personal act of
the parties must , ex necessitate
rei, operate instantly , or
be entirely inoperative .
There would be a manifest
con-
tradiction if an
estate , which
is not to commence till
hereafter , could be granted by a conveyance which imports
an immediate possession.
A second rule to be observed
is this , that the remainder
Remainder
(g) "It is
said, that
an estate-
tail limited after an estate for years
is a remainder . I deny that, as a
general proposition .
Can
any case
be shown where an estate for years
was given
to
A. , with limitation
over to B. for life or in fee, and B.
was held not to take
an immediate
estate of freehold ?"

Ad. 283, 306.
(h) This does not apply to chattel
interests , as in fact is obvious
when
the reason given in the text is con-
sidered , because livery of seisin was
not applicable
to them .

ticular
estite must
pass
out
of
grantor at
same time
.
Remainder
must vest
instantly
upon deter-
particular
estate
.
must be granted
at
the time of the creation
of
the par-
ticular
estate
(k).
As
,
where there
is
an estate
to
A.
for
life
,
with remainder
to
B.
in
fee
:
here B.'s
remainder
in
fee passes from the grantor
at
the same time that
seisin
is
delivered
to
A.
of his life estate
in
possession
.
And
it
is
this
which
induces
the
necessity
at
common
law
of
livery
of
seisin
being
made on the
particular
estate
,
whenever
a
freehold
remainder
is
created
.
For
,
if
it
be
limited
even
on
an
estate
for years
,
it
is
necessary
that
the lessee for years should
have livery
of
seisin
,
in
order
to
convey the freehold from and out
of
the grantor
,
other-
wise
no
estate
except the term
of
years
is
created
(1).
The
livery
is
unnecessary
to
strengthen
the
estate
for
years
;
but
is
requisite
to
convey the freehold
,
and
yet
cannot be given
to
him
in
remainder without infringing
the possession
of
the lessee for years
,
therefore
the
law
allows
,
as
we have already
shown
,
such livery
,
made
to
the tenant
for years
,
to
relate
and enure
to
him
in
re-
mainder
,
as
both are but one estate
in
law
(
m).
A
third rule
respecting
remainders
is
this
:
that the
remainder must vest
in
the grantee during the continuance
mination
of
of
the
particular
estate
,
or
eo
instanti
that
it
determines
,
except
in
certain
cases
(
).
As
,
if
A.
be tenant for life
,
remainder to B. in tail
:
here B.'s remainder
is
vested in
him
,
at
the creation
of
the particular
estate
to
A.
for life
:
or
if
A.
and
B.
be
tenants for their joint lives
,
remainder
to
the
survivor
in
fee
;
here
,
though
during their joint
lives the remainder
is
vested
in
neither
,
yet on the death
of
either
of
them
,
the remainder
vests instantly
in
the
survivor
wherefore both these are good remainders
.
But
,
if
an
estate
be
limited
to
A.
for life
,
remainder
to
the
eldest son of
B.
in
tail
,
and
A.
dies before
B.
has any
son
:
here the remainder will
be void
,
for
it
did not vest
in
any one during the continuance
,
nor
at
the determina-
tion
,
of
the particular
estate
:

Jean

B.
should
afterwards
have
a
son
,
he will not take by this
remainder
;
for
,
as
it
did not vest
at
or
before the end of
the particular
estate
,
it
never can vest
at
all
,
but
is
gone
for
ever
(6).
And this depends upon the principle
before
laid down
,
that
the precedent particular
estate
,
and the
remainder
,
are
one
estate
in
law
;
they must
therefore
subsist and be
in
esse at
one
and the same instant
of
time
,
either during the continuance
of
the first estate
,
or
at
the very instant when that determines
,
so
that no other
estate can
possibly come between
them
.
For there can
be
no
intervening
estate between the particular
estate and
the
remainder
supported thereby
(p
):
the thing supported
must fall
to
the ground
,
if
once
its
support
be
severed
from
it
.
There
are
,
however
,
as
we have stated
,
excep- There
are
tions
to
this
rule
,
which
we shall consider
more satis-
to
the
rule
.
factorily when we come
to
speak
of
the various
kinds
of
remainders
.
These exceptions
depend
,
as
we shall
see
,
entirely upon legislative authority
.
We may also add
as
part
of
this rule
that
the mode
of
limitation
of the remainder must be such that
it
does
not take effect before the determination
of the particular
estate
.
For
it
is
a
principle of the common law
,
that
whenever
either
the whole
fee
,
or
a
particular
estate
,
as
an estate for life
,
or
in
tail
,
is
first limited
,
no condition
can be annexed
to
the prior estate
,
which should have the
double effect
of
defeating the
estate
and passing the land
.
to
another
(q).
Suppose
a
feoffment habendum
to
A.
for
his life
,
but
if
C.
should return from Rome
,
then
to
C.
in
fee
,
this
is
a
void remainder
,
as
being
an
attempt
to
defeat
the prior
estate
.
The
same result
might
,
however
,
be
validly arrived
at
by importing
into the first life estate
a
restriction
;
thus
a
feoffment habendum
to
A.
so long
as
he should live
,
and
C.
should not return from Rome
,
and
in case
C. should
return
from
Rome
,
then
to
C.
or
his
heirs
,
is
a
good remainder
,
which would
take
effect
if

should
return
from Rome
during A.'s lifetime .
Such
difficulties ,
however ,
as
these
never
occur in
modern
conveyancing , which
would
never take the form above-
mentioned .
A fourth rule controlling
the limitation of remainders ,
is that a remainder
may not be limited
to a child of an
unborn
person (r).
Such
a limitation
,
as
tending
to a
perpetuity ,
is
considered
as
absolutely
void .
Thus , if
lands
be limited in
succession
to a person in esse , and
after his decease
to his unborn
children , and afterwards
to the
children
of
such
unborn
children , this last re-
mainder
is
absolutely
void (s) .
And
we may
add
that
a limitation
of such a void remainder
makes all subse-
quent remainders
bad ,
even though
they be limited
to
living persons (1).
The last two cases
lead
us to the
distinction
which
exists between the two main classes into which remainders
are divided , called respectively Vested and Contingent .
Where there is a present
capacity for taking
effect in
possession , if the possession were to become vacant , the
remainder
is
vested , and it is not the less
so because ,
notwithstanding
the present capacity , there is a possibility
that the remainder will never come into actual possession .
Thus , if land be limited
to A. for life , remainder to B. (a
living person ) for life, with remainder over, B.'s remainder
is a vested interest , although if he were to die before A. ,

(s)
Therefore , in
settlements
of
real
estate, where it is desired
to
tie up the property
as far
as pos-
sible , the practice
is to give estates
for life to all persons who are living ,
and
estates
tail
to
unborn
chil-
dren , the
estates
being
arranged
in
order
suited
to
the
wishes

Some limitations
taking
effect after
a void remainder
were
held
good , not
as remainders , but
as substantive
and independent
or

gifts , contingent upon an
event which must take place within
the lawful period .

of

of the

.
3rd
.
Where the
condition
upon which the remainder
is
limited
is
certain in event
,
but the
deter-
mination of the
particular
estate
may happen before
it.
4th
.
Where
the person to whom the remainder
is
limited
is
not yet ascertained
,
or
not yet in being
.
The following are examples given
by him of these
four kinds
:
-1
.
A
grant
to A. until
C.
shall
return
from
Rome
,
and
after
such
return
of C. then to
remain
over in fee
.
2.
A
grant
to
A.
for life
,
remainder
to
B.
for life
,
and
if
B.
die before
A.,
remainder
to
C.
for life
.
3. A
grant
to A. for life
,
and after the
death
of

lation
has
done
much
to
free them from
the
fetters
which technical
doctrines
had
thrown
about
them , and
they in fact now
are
subject
only
to those peculiarities
and trammels which
are involved in their very essence (*).
Reverting
to our description of a contingent
remainder ,
a
few
remarks
occur.
First , where
the
remainder
is
limited to a person
either
unborn
or
unascertained , any
remainder
to an unborn
person , as to the children
of a
tenant for life , who at the time of the settlement
has
no
son, is of course
contingent , because
non constat that he
will ever have a son .
Formerly , in order that the estate
might vest in the
son , it was necessary that he
should
actually be born in the lifetime of his
father , so that a
posthumous son was excluded from taking a remainder,
not being in esse
at the
determination
of the
particular
estate (a).
To
remedy this
hardship
an
act (b)
was
passed ,
declaring
that
posthumous
children
under
the
limitations
contained
in marriage
or other
settlements
(which have been considered to include wills ) , shall
take
in the same manner
as if born in the lifetime of their
parent .
The effect of this is that
such a child
takes all
the profits from the death of the parent (c).
(z) Formerly they
were thought
not to be
devisable
by will ,
but
later
cases decided
that they came
within the Statute of Wills . Fearne ,

much of their
liability to defeat .

In

of

certain
theories

now exploded
upon which this restriction
was formerly
supposed to rest
.
It
was said
,
and for this we have
in
especial Lord Coke's great authority
,
that
the validity of
a
contingent
remainder
depended upon
the
character
of
the contingency
or
possibility
upon
which
it
depended
.
A
possibility which
shall make
a
remainder good
,
ought
to
be
a
common possibility
,
and potentia
propinqua
;
as
,
death
,
or
death without issue
,
or
coverture
,
or
the like
.
If
a
lease
be
made for life
,
with remainder
to
the heirs
of
J.
S.,
this
is
good
;
for
,
by common possibility
,
J.
S.
may
die
during the life
of
the tenant
for life
;
but
if
at
the
time
of
the limitation
there
is
no such person
as
J.
S.,
but during the life
of
the tenant for life
J.
S.
is
born
,
and
dies
,
his
heirs
shall never
take

The
second
case

as
potentia remotissima

The same
somewhat
metaphysical
idea was
expressed
sometimes by saying
that there could not be
a
possibility
upon
a
possibility
,
or
a
contingency
upon
a
contingency
adopted
as
a
means
of
limiting an estate

bad ; because
although
the limitation to a son simpliciter
was good , it being a simple possibility
that he should have
one , yet there
was a double possibility involved
in his
having a son of a particular
name (e) .
It has been well
remarked
that if the son would
get an
estate
by being
christened John , there was a strong
likelihood
instead of
a mere possibility
that he would
receive that name .
The
whole theory about possibilities
has long been dissipated ,
and only
deserves
mention
from the greatness of those
men who have enunciated it (ƒ).
It is a consequence
of the nature of remainders gene-
rally that a contingent remainder , if it amounts to a free-
hold , cannot be limited
unless the previous
estate be
a
freehold .
Thus , if land
be granted
to A. for
ten
years ,
with remainder
in fee to the right
heirs of B. , this
re-
mainder is void (9) ; but if granted
to A. for life , with a
like
remainder , it is
good .
For ,
unless
the
freehold
passes out of the grantor at the time when the remainder
is created, such freehold remainder is void : it cannot pass
out of him, without
vesting
somewhere ; and in the case
of a contingent
remainder it must vest in the particular
tenant ,
else it can vest nowhere ; unless , therefore , the
estate of such particular
tenant
be of a freehold
nature ,
the freehold
cannot
vest in him,
and
consequently
the
remainder is void .
Before proceeding further with the consideration
of re-
mainders , and
the peculiarities
which distinguish
those
which are contingent , we must
here mention
a doctrine
which has had much , and still retains
some , influence over
their fortunes .
When a less
estate
and a greater , limited
subsequent to it , coincide
and meet in one and the same
person
without
any intermediate
estate (h), the
less is
immediately
annihilated , or, in the law phraseology
,
is

MERGER .

merger.
said to be
merged ,
that
is,
sunk
or
drowned
in the Doctrine of
greater : or, to express the
same thing in other words ,
the greater
estate is accelerated , so
as to become at once
an estate
in possession
.
Thus , if A. be tenant for years
with remainder to B. for life , and A. assign his
term to
B. , or the two
estates
come together in any other way,
the term is merged in the freehold
estate ;
and
so in
other cases .
If,
however , the
order
of limitation
be
otherwise , that
is , if A. be tenant for life , remainder
to
B.
for
years
,
there would
be
no
merger
on their union
,
indeed
it
would
be
obviously
inconsistent
with
reason
that the term which
is
by express limitation
to
exist after
A.'s death should
by
any means
be
entirely
lost
:
whereas
in
the case first put
,
on
the supposition
,
which
the law
always makes
,
that
an
estate
for life
is
greater
than
a
term
of
years
however
long
,
there
is
no such incon-
sistency
(¿).
It
seems that
as an
estate
for
one's own life
is
con-
sidered
as
greater than one pur autre vie
(k),
there would
be
a
merger upon
an
estate pur autre
vie
coming
to
a
tenant for life
in
immediate
remainder
,
though opposite
opinions
on
this point
have been
sometimes entertained
.
Certainly this view
is
less consonant
to
reason than
in
the
ordinary
case
of
merger
,
whatever
be
thoughtof the
reasonableness
of
the doctrine
in
general
().
Indeed
it
has been thought
that
two
estates
of
equal
character
(

will unite by merger
,
so
that the one
in
(i)
Where

the
doctrine
is
one
to

mind
,
as
,
if
the

purchased

,
the
proper course
,
in order
to
preserve
his

of
the

alone will exist in the same manner
as if it
were
in
possession ;
thus
a term of years
has
been
thought
to merge in another
limited
in immediate
re-
mainder , even though for a less number of years (n) ; but
this
seems
so contrary to reason
that it can hardly
be
received as sound law. If a term of years be created out
of a larger term , and the term so created
and the rever-
sionary term coalesce , there would doubtless be a merger,
and naturally
so ; but that a term of twenty years
should
merge in a term of ten years originally limited
to
com-
mence after the expiration
of the first term, so that the
owner of both , instead of having an estate for thirty years ,
should
have
only
one for ten years , is alien to all prin-
ciples of justice .

Also it has been held that if a contingent
interest
be
created between the particular
estate and the remainder ,
these, though given to the same person, do not merge (p),
as they would do if there were no such contingent limi-
tation .
Thus, where the limitations were to A. for life,
and if he should
die without leaving
issue living at his
death to A. and his heirs , it was held that A.'s life estate
did not merge in the remainder to him in fee (9) .

MERGER .

there was a merger , so as to cause the limitation in fee to
take effect in possession , and this had, as
its
consequence
,
the exclusion for ever
of
the
contingent
estate
(r).
Of
these cases
of
destruction
of
contingent
remainders
we
shall presently
see something more
.
A
further limitation
to
the general doctrine
of
merger
,
is,
that the two estates
do not unite by merger
,
unless they
be
held
in
the
same
right
.
Thus
,
if
a
lessee for years
.
dies and
makes
the freehold
reversioner his executor
,
so
that the term
vests
in
him
,
yet
,
it
being
held
en
autre
droit
,
there
is
no
merger
.
So
,
if
.
tenant
in
fee marries
the lessce
for years
,
there
is
no merger
,
for he has the
entrance
in
his
own right
,
but the term
in
that
of
his
wife
(s)
;
and
if
the wife
survives
her husband
,
and he
have not alienated
the land and the term
,
the term sur-
vives
to
her
(t).
If
one
of
the
estates
be
a
mere legal estate
vested
in
the tenant
as
trustee
,
there will still
be
a
merger
at
law
,
for courts of law take
no notice of trusts
,
but of course
equity will
interfere
to
protect
those
who
claim
under
the trusts from injury

ESTATES
IN
POSSESSION
AND
REMAINDER.
Rule in
Shelley's
case.
We must next notice a celebrated rule of construction
of instruments
which is intimately connected with the
theory of remainders .
It is usually
called the Rule in
Shelley's
case , from the distinct enunciation
which Lord
Coke gives in his report of that case (x) , although
the rule
itself is of ancient date (y).
" It is a rule in law when
the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of
freehold , and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is
limited mediately or immediately
to his heirs in fee or in
tail, that always in such
cases
the heirs ' are words of
limitation of the estate , and not words of purchase ." In
other words that , observing that the effect of adding to a
gift to a man (which , taken alone , would
give him a life
estate), an immediate
subsequent gift to his
heirs , is to
enlarge the life estate
to a disposable
fee
simple
;
so the
gift to his heirs in any subsequent part of the limitation.
of estates
produces the same effect of giving
him
a re-
mainder in fee
simple ; if the
words
used be
' heirs of
his body ,' of course
the result is a fee tail (~).
Reverting
now to contingent
remainders , we come to a
peculiarity
which they possess , and which formerly
was of
far greater
consequence
than it is now .
This , which we
have already hinted
at , is their liability to being defeated
in certain cases .
The cases in which this happens are now
few, since the legislature
has interfered
to protect
them
from most of the dangers which
used to beset them .
the
particular
estate upon which
a remainder
depended
determined
before the contingency
happened whereby it
became vested , since at the
only moment when it could
become an estate in possession it was not ready to do so,
some other
vested
estate
fell into possession and could

(*) Much intricate
learning
has
arisen out of this
rule , for which
readers
may consult

ting. Rem . 76 ; Hayes ' Principles for
If

recent
discussions
on the applica-

not afterwards
be defeated : or , if not some other estate
limited as a remainder , then the grantor's
original
estate
reverted
to him and could not again be taken out of him.
Thus , where there was an estate for life limited
to A. with
remainder to the
eldest son of B. for life
(B. having
no
son at the date of the settlement ) , remainder to C. in fee ,
unless B.'s son was
born
when
A.'s life
estate
deter-
mined , C. would take possession , and B.'s son never could
come in.
Not only , however , did such a disappointment
occur , if B.'s son were not born
at the date of the death
of the tenant for life , or the determination
of his
estate
by forfeiture , but if A.
conveyed his
estate
for life to
C. , so
that
C.
became
seised
of
an
estate in posses-
sion
together with the first subsequent vested
estate
in
remainder , there was in this case also a defeat of the con-
tingent remainder .
Because the effect of such a union of
two estates in the same person
is to merge the lesser
estate in the greater , or C.'s estate pur autre vie became
lost in the greater
estate
in
fee , which
being
therefore
vested in possession could
not afterwards
be affected
by
any contingency .
It will
be
seen that these doctrines
gave considerable
power to the tenant for life, and those
in remainder , by collusion
to defeat the intention of the
settlor .
To prevent these consequences
, conveyancers
(a) invented
a means of securing contingent remainders
from destruc-
tion, by limiting
after
the
particular
estate
for life an
estate to trustees for the natural life of the tenant for life
upon trusts to preserve
the contingent
remainders .
This
being
a
vested remainder , always
ready
to
come into
possession when the particular
estate should determine by
forfeiture
or
otherwise
than
by
death,
prevented
the
possibility of the
ultimate
estates
becoming
united

.
possession as long
as there was
a possibility that
the
contingent
estate might arise.
The usual form of family settlements became then much
of this sort : to A. (the head of the family) for life , remain-
der to B. the
eldest son of A. (usually
a bachelor at the
date of the settlement ) for life , with remainder , after the
determination of these
estates
by forfeiture
or otherwise,
to trustees during the life of B. , upon trust to preserve
contingent
remainders
with remainder
to the eldest and
other sons of B. successively in tail , with remainder to C. ,
another son of A. , for his life, and so on.
It will be seen that the principal
danger in settlements
of this
class, from which conveyancers had to protect the
contingent
remainders , limited
to the unborn sons , were
those arising from the sudden determination
by forfeiture ,
surrender , or merger , of the preceding freehold
estates .
These then are the dangers from which the legislature
has protected those who have not had the assistance of
skilled
conveyancers ; they
areobviously dangers
which
one venturing
to make his own will, though
unlearned in
legal subtleties , would assuredly pass over sicco pede .
By
the act amending the law of real property (b), it is pro-
vided that contingent
remainders
shall
be, and if created
before the
passing
of the
act, shall be
deemed
to be,
capable of taking
effect,
notwithstanding
the determi-
nation by forfeiture , surrender , or merger of any preceding
estate of freehold , in all respects as if such determination
had not happened .
It is to be observed that this
act, though in ordinary
family
settlements
it has
rendered
the limitation to
trustees to preserve contingent
remainders
unnecessary ,
yet has not obviated their necessity in all cases.
To take
the
example
above stated of a limitation to A. for life ,
with remainder
to the eldest son of B.
(a bachelor ) , or to
A. for life, and remainder to such of his children as should
(b) 7 & 8 Vict . c. 106, s. 8.


EXECUTORY
DEVISES .
333
attain the age of twenty -one (c) .
In these cases the con-
tingent remainder might not take effect , even though the
particular
estate should
determine in the natural
mode
by the death of A.
In such
cases
a limitation to trustees to preserve the
contingent remainders is still necessary
. But it is obvious
that the liability to defeat in these
cases
depends upon
the character of the limitations, and the simple
rule of
law that the freehold must
vest in some
one , and if it
vests under a limitation subsequent to the contingent re-
mainder , the
estate
so vested
can never be divested in
favour of a prior limitation :
therefore , after
the
deter-
mination
of the life estate , if there were no trustees , and
no child had
then
attained
twenty -one , (or in the first
case if B.
had no
son ,) there
being
no one to take the
freehold except the subsequent remaindermen , their
estate
would vest indefeasibly .
We have said that under the Statutes of Uses (d) and
Wills (e) limitations not falling
within the
definition
of remainders , and which would
be void if attempted to
be created by simple grant , are within certain restrictions
permitted .
Those which
depend upon the
operation of
the former statute will more properly be considered when
we come to speak of the mode of alienation
of real pro-
perty by deed , inasmuch as the present system of convey-
ancing depends for much of its efficacy upon that statute .
But the limitations
which
have been sanctioned in wills
(which being
often drawn
up
when
the
party
is

consilii,
are always
more favoured in construction
than
formal
deeds , which are presumed to be made with great

They
have been called

there may be some little

formerly ,
when

from
so many more events
than is now the case .
It was
then adopted as an inflexible
rule that a limitation
which
could take effect as a contingent remainder
should never
be construed as an executory devise (f) .
This rule, were
such questions
now to arise, would still govern
the deci-
sion of the courts .
An executory
devise may then be defined as a limita-
tion contained in a will , of a future
estate or interest in
lands which the law permits , although if it were
contained
in a conveyance
at common law it would
be void ( g).
Thus , if a devise to A. and his heirs

die
without
issue in the lifetime
of B. , then
to
B. and
his heirs (h) ;
or a devise to A. , a spinster , and her heirs ,
upon
the
day of her
marriage , these devises will
take
effect according
to their tenor .
Yet it will be observed.
that in the former
case there is a previous
gift of a fee
simple , and in the latter , no previous gift at all ; in either
case , therefore ,
such
a limitation
would
be
void in a
common law conveyance.

tory devise and
a contingent
remainder
arose from the
fact that the former
were indestructible , and when the
eventtook place upon which
they were to become vested
estates, that
result
followed , whatever might have hap-
pened to the other estates which existed ;
with, however ,
this exception, that
an
executory devise, or
conditional
limitation
made
upon
an
estate tail , could
always
be
barred by the recovery of the tenant in tail, and may now
be barred by a disentailing
deed
duly executed and en-
rolled before the
happening of the event on which
the
ulterior
limitation
was to arise, for in such
a case the
executory devise might be considered as a remainder upon
the
estate tail
,
only subject
to
the limitation imposed by
the condition
.

,
if

made

,
and the heirs
of

which

is
that contained
in
the well
-
known
rule against
perpetuities
(
as
it
is
usually called
),
a
rule unknown
to
the common law
,
to
which
indeed
executory devises
were themselves unknown
,
and yet
not
imposed
by

,
but
established

the
judges

cases
where
gestation
exists (k) .
Or this
last part of the
rule
might be perhaps
better
stated
as follows : that for the
purpose of giving a benefit , an infant shall be deemed to
be in existence whilst in its mother's womb .
Any number
of lives in being , it may be observed
, may be chosen ,
for
"
all the candles being lighted
up
at
once
are all burning
at
the same time
"(7).
The time
at
which the lives are
to
be in existence
is
the death
of
the testator
(
m
).
In
applying
the rule
to
determine
the question
of
the
validity
of
any limitation
,
the courts
do
not inquire whether
in the events
that have happened
,
the executory limitation
takes effect within the time allowed
;
but unless the limi-
tation
be
such that
it
must take effect within that period
,
it
is
absolutely void ab initio
(n).
The
rule regulating
the validity
of
devises
of
freehold
interests
in
land
is
equally
applicable
to
bequests
of
chattel interests
.
Limitations of chattel
interests
stand
upon
a
different
footing
to
those
of
freeholds
,
for they
do
not involve
the peculiarity
which
distinguishes
those
of
freeholds
;
as
there
is
no
feudal
rule
rendering
them
liable
,
even
if
of
the nature
of
contingent
remainders
,
to
destruction
,
therefore their validity never depends
upon the
character
of
the limitation
,
whether
it
be

mainder

but every
reason
which
can be urged for restraining
a
devise
from operating
over
too
prolonged
a period , is
equally applicable
to the limitations of a term .
A chattel
interest
may therefore be given
over by way of executory
bequest at any time
before the
expiration of twenty - one
years following any number of lives in being (p).
Amid
the various
capricious
devices
which
testators
invent
as to the destination
of their property , it often
happens that they neglect to dispose of the annual income
of their property during
some interval preceding the time
when
a contingent
executory gift takes effect ; in such a
case
the
rent
and
annual
income
become part
of the
residuary
estate , or if that be undisposed of, go to those
who would have been entitled if there had been no will ;
they
do
not ,
as , perhaps
not
unnaturally , it has been
contended , go to the person entitled
under the contingent
gift (q).
upon accu-
income.
In this
place, as closely
connected with the rule pro-
Restriction
hibiting what the law calls perpetuities , we may mention
mulation of
another restriction
upon the disposition of property which
the legislature
has imposed .
The rule against perpetuities
put , as we see , a limit upon the postponement ofthe vesting
of property , but it did no more ; it put no further restraint

those individuals who naturally expect to share a testator's
or settlor's bounty .
Political reasons have , moreover, been
suggested against permitting
such accumulations , for agreat
concentration of wealth in particular
persons might
prove
an inconvenience to the state.
Upon these grounds , when
an attempt of this kind had
been
made, and
a certain
testator (r) made a will directing
the accumulation
of the
income of his property during the lives of all his descend-
ants who should
be living
at his death (who proved
to
be numerous ) , for the purpose of enriching
some
remote
descendant, who was to become entitled
at the
extreme
period allowed by the then law , the attention of the legisla-
ture being called to the fact , an act was passed (s) prohi-
biting for the future (t) any direction , either by a deed or
will, for accumulation
of annual
income of either
real or
personal property
for a longer
period
than the life of the
settlor , or the term of twenty -one years from the death of
the
settlor .
Exceptions
are , however, made in favour
of
a direction
for
accumulation
when
they have
for
their
object the payment of debts of the settlor , or the provi-
sion of portions
for his
children , and also in favour
of
directions
touching
the produce of timber or
wood
upon
any lands or tenements .
Having set forth the
nature of remainders
at
almost
greater length than
the comparative
simplicity which the
law has gradually
assumed
seems
to render
requisite , it
remains
for us to notice
another
species
of estate , which
is created by the act and operation of the law itself , and
this is called a reversion .
An
estate in
reversion
is
the
residue of an
estate
left in the grantor , to commence in possession after the

REVERSIONS .

:
determination
of
some
particular
estate
granted
by
him (u) .
Sir Edward
Coke (v) describes a reversion to be
the returning of land to the grantor
or his heirs after the
grant is
over .
As , if there be a gift in tail , the
rever-
sion of the fee
is , without
any special
reservation , vested
in the donor by act of law
and so also the reversion ,
after an estate for life , years , or at will , continues in the
lessor .
For the fee - simple of all lands must abide some-
where ; and if he , who was before possessed
of the whole ,
carves out of it any smaller
estate , and grants it away,
whatever is not so granted remains
in him.
A reversion
is never therefore
created by deed
or writing , but arises
from construction of law ;
a
remainder
can
never be
limited , unless by either
deed
or devise.
But
they
are
equally
transferable , when
actually
vested, being
both
estates in præsenti , though taking
effect infuturo .
from feudal
tion.
The doctrine of reversions
is plainly derived from the Derived
feudal constitution .
For , when a feud was granted
to a constitu-
man for life ,
or to him and
his
issue male , rendering
either
rent or other
services
; then
on his death , or the
failure of issue male , the feud was determined , and re-
sulted
back to the lord or proprietor , to be again disposed
of at his pleasure .
And
hence the usual
incidents
to
reversions are said to be fealty and rent .
When no rent
is reserved on the particular
estate , fealty however results
of course , as an incident
quite inseparable , and may be ,
though
it never is , demanded
as a badge of tenure ,
or
acknowledgment
of superiority
; being frequently the only
evidence that the lands
are holden at all .
Where
rent is
reserved , it is also incident , though
not inseparably
so , to
the reversion (x) .
The rent may
be
granted
away , re-
serving the reversion ; and the reversion may be granted
away, reserving
the
rent , by special
words : but
by a
general grant of the reversion , the rent will pass with it,
as incident thereunto ; though
by the grant of the rent

generally , the
reversion
will not
pass .
The
incident
passes
by the grant of the principal , but
not
e converso
:
for the maxim oflaw is, " accessorium
non ducit , sed sequitur ,
suum principale " (y).
These
incidental
rights
of the
reversioner ,
and the
respective
modes of descent, in which remainders
very
frequently
differ from reversions , have occasioned the law
to be careful in distinguishing
the
one from the
other,
however inaccurately
the parties themselves may describe
them .
For if one ,
seised by
descent of
an
estate in
fee ,
makes
a lease for
life , with remainder
to
himself
and his
heirs ,
this
is properly
a mere reversion (~) , to
which rent and fealty shall
be incident : and which
shall
only descend
to the heirs of the last purchaser , and not to
his own heirs , as a remainder limited to him by a third
person
would
have
done (a ) : for it is
the old
estate,
which
was originally in him, and never yet was out of
him.
And so likewise , if a man grants a lease for life to
A. , reserving
rent , with reversion to B. and his heirs, B.
has a remainder descendible to his heirs
general , and not
a reversion to which the rent is incident
; but the grantor
shall
be entitled
to the rent , during
the continuance
of
A.'s estate (b).
Again , a tenant for years may demise the lands
com-
prised in his
term for a shorter
term , and then he will
have a reversion
for years , in which
the derivative
term
will merge if they come
together in the
same
person .
Where
a tenant
for years
wishes
substantially
to
part
with the term , but at the same time to remain
tenant
to
his
own landlord , and to stand in the relation of rever-
sioner to the
intended
sub -tenant ;
or where
the latter
does
not
choose
to
take
upon
himself the
responsi-
bility of assignee of the original lease, it is
common
to
demise the premises
comprised in the term , to hold to

occupy and
hold
them .
And , considered in this
view ,
estates of any quantity
or length of duration , and whether
they be in actual possession or expectancy , may be held
in four different ways : in severalty , in joint -tenancy , in
coparcenary , and in common .
ralty .
He that holds lands
or tenements in severalty , or is In seve
sole tenant thereof , is he that holds them in his
own
right only, without
any other person being joined or con-
nected
with
him in point of interest , during
his
estate
therein .
This
is the most
common
and
usual
way of
holding an estate ; and therefore we may make the
same
observations
here, that we did upon estates
in possession ,
as distinguished
from
those in expectancy , in the pre-
ceding chapter
that
there
is little or nothing
peculiar
to be remarked
concerning it, since all
estates
are sup-
posed to be of this
sort , unless where they are expressly
declared to be otherwise
; and that in laying down general
rules and doctrines , we usually apply them to such estates
as are held in severalty .
We shall
therefore proceed to
consider the other three species of estates , in which there
are always a plurality of tenants .
An estate in joint -tenancy is
where

are granted
to
two
or
more persons , to hold in
fee -simple ,
fee -tail,
for life ,
for
years ,
or
at will.
It
consequence
of such grants an estate is called an estate in
joint -tenancy (a) ,
and sometimes
an
estate in jointure ,
which
word , as well as the
other , signifies
an union
o:
conjunction
of interest
; though in common
speech
the
term jointure is now usually
confined to that joint estate ,
which , by virtue of the statute 27 Hen.
8, c. 10 , is fre-
quently vested in the husband
and wife
before marriage ,
as a full satisfaction and bar of the woman's dower
( b).
In unfolding
this title , and the two remaining
ones in
the present chapter , we will first inquire how these estates.
may be created ; next as to their properties and respective
incidents ; and lastly , how they may be severed
or destroyed .
The
creation
of
an
estate
in joint -tenancy ,
depends
on the wording of
the
deed
or devise , by which the
tenants claim title
for this
estate can only arise by pur-
chase or grant , that is , by the act of the parties , and never
by the mere act of law.
Now, if property , the nature of
which is
not
incompatible
with joint
ownership (c) , be
given
to a plurality of persons , without adding
any re-
strictive , exclusive , or explanatory words , as if an estate
be granted to A. and B. and their heirs , this
makes them
immediately
joint -tenants in fee of the lands .
For the
law interprets the grant
so as to make all parts of it take
(a) Litt. s. 277.
(b) Ante , p. 262.
(c) If the nature
of the thing
granted ,
or
the
character
of the
grantees , is
repugnant
to a joint-
tenancy , the grantees will take in
common . "If a corody be granted
to two men and their heirs , in this
case, because
the
corody is uncer-
tain , and cannot be severed, it shall
amount to a several grant
to each
of them of one corody ; for the per-
sons be several , and
the
corody is
personal ."
Co. Litt.
190 a.
So ,
if lands
be given
to two
bishops
and their successors , they
take in
common , " because they are seised
in several rights, for the one bishop
is seised in the right of his bishopric
of the
one moiety , and the
other
in
right
of his
bishopric
of the
other
moiety , and
so
by several
titles,
and
in
several
capacities
;
whereas joint -tenants ought to have
it in one and
the
same right and
capacity , and by one and the same
joint title."

effect , which can only be done by creating an equal estate
in them both .
As therefore the grantor has thus united
their names, the law gives them
a thorough union in all
other respects.
perties.
The properties of a joint
estate are
derived
from
its Pro-
unity , which is fourfold
; the unity of interest , the unity
of title , the unity of time , and the unity of possession :
or, in other words , joint -tenants have one and the same
interest , accruing by one and the same conveyance , com-
mencing at one and the same time , and held
by one and
the same undivided
possession .
interest.
First , they must have one and the same interest .
One Unity of
joint-tenant cannot be entitled to one period of duration
or quantity
of
interest
in lands ,
and the other to a
different ;
one cannot be tenant for life , and the other for
years ;
one cannot
be tenant in fee ,
and the
other in
tail (d ) .
But if land
be limited
to A. and B. for their
lives , this makes them joint -tenants of the freehold ; if to
A. and B. and their heirs , it makes them joint -tenants of
the inheritance (e).
If land be granted to A. and B.
for
their lives , and to the heirs of A.; here A. and B. are joint-
tenants of the freehold during their respective lives , and A.
has the remainder of the fee in severalty (ƒ) : or if land be
given to A. and B. and the heirs of the body of A.; here
(d) Co. Litt. 188.
(e) Litt. s. 277.
Lord Coke says,
that
if
a
rent -charge
of
107. be
granted to
A. and
B. to have and
to hold to them
two , viz. to A. till
he be married , and to B. till he be
advanced to
a benefice,
they
are
joint-tenants
in the meantime , not-
withstanding
the limitations
; and
if A. die before marriage , the rent
shall survive
to B., but if A. had
married ,
the
rent
should
have
ceased for
a moiety ,
et sic e con-
verso, on the other side.
Co. Litt .
180 b ; 2 Cruise, Digest , 498.
(f) The passage in Littleton is,
"If lands be given
to two , and
to
the
heirs
of one
of them , this is
a good jointure, and the one hath
a freehold
and
the
other
a fee-
simple ."
And in his commentary
Coke says, that he who
has the fee
cannot
grant it
away
as
a
re-
mainder , distinct
from his life es-
tate ; therefore
the effect seems to
be
as
stated
in the
text ,
except
that A.'s interest
is looked
upon as
all one estate.

Case,

Unity of

Unity of

they have
a joint estate , A. having in addition
a several
remainder in tail ( g) . If the gift
be to A.
and B.
and
the heirs
of their bodies,
then
since (if A. and B. be
men )
they
cannot
have both the same
heirs
of their
bodies, the inheritances in tail are severed , but they have
a joint estate for their lives ( ). If A. and B. were one a
man
and the other
a woman , then the gift would be in
special tail, since they may marry and have heirs accord-
ing to the gift ; they take each
a moiety of the land during
their joint lifetime , and the survivor the whole in special
tail.
Secondly , joint -tenants must also have an unity of
title : their estate must
be
created by one and the same
act,
whether
legal
or illegal ;
as by one and the same
grant ,
or
by one and the
same
disseisin ( ).
Joint-
tenancy
cannot
arise
by
descent
or
act of
law ;
but
merely
by
purchase , or
acquisition
by the
act of the
party
and , unless that act be one and the same , the two
tenants
would
have
different
titles ;
and if
they
had
different
titles , one might prove good and the other bad ,
which would
absolutely
destroy the jointure.
Thirdly,
there must also be an unity of time ; their
estates
must
be vested at one and the same period , as well as by one
and the same title .
As in case of a present estate
made
to A. and B.;
or a remainder in fee to A. and B. after
a
particular
estate ;
in either
case , A.
and B.
are joint-
tenants of this present
estate , or this vested
remainder .
But if, after a lease for life , the remainder be limited to the
heirs of A. and B.; and during the continuance of the par-
ticular
estate A. dies , which
vests the remainder of one
moiety in his heir :
and then B. dies , whereby the other
moiety becomes
vested in the heir of B.: now A.'s heir and
B.'s
heir
are
not joint -tenants
of this remainder , but

:
tenants in common ; for one moiety vested at one time , and
the other moiety vested at another (k) .
Under the Statute
of Uses , however, a joint -tenancy may be created though
the estates vest at different
times .
Thus, where a feoff-
ment
is
made to the use of a man , and such wife as he
shall
afterwards
marry , for term of their lives , and he
afterwards marries ; in this case the husband and wife has
a joint - estate ,
though
vested
at
different
times (7) :
because the use of the wife's
estate
is in abeyance
and dor-
mant till the intermarriage
;
and , being
then
awakened ,
has relation back , and takes
effect from the original time
of creation .
Similar results
were arrived
at under
the Unity of
Statute of Wills , and
occur
now daily (m ) .
Lastly , in
joint-tenancy there must be an unity of possession . Joint-
tenants
are said to be seised per my et per tout, which
expression
indicates , in accordance with the fact , that for
some purposes the possession is only of a part (my , moitié ,
or moiety , denoting
a part , usually
a half ( n ) ) , and for
other purposes the possession is of the whole (o).
The
seisin of each of them is of the whole , one is not seised
of one part and the
other of the other part , neither can
one be exclusively
seised
of one acre , and his companion
of another ;
but each has an undivided
moiety of the
whole , and
not
the
whole
of an undivided
moiety (p).

And therefore , if an estate
in fee be given
to a man and
his
wife by such
an assurance
as would
create
a joint-
estate in two persons not man and wife , they are neither
properly joint-tenants , nor tenants in common :
for
hus-
band and wife being considered
as
one person
in
law
,
they
cannot take the estate by moieties
,
but both are seised
of
the entirety
,
per tout
et
non per my
:
the
consequence
of
which
is
,
that neither the husband nor the wife can dispose
of
any part without the assent
of
the other
,
but the whole
must remain
to
the survivor
(q).
"
Also
if
a
joint
-
estate
be made
of
land
to
a
husband and wife
,
and
to
a
third
person
,
in
this case the husband
and wife have
in
law
,
in
their
right
,
but
the
moiety
,
and the third person shall
have
as
much
as
the
husband
and wife
,
viz
.
the
other
moiety
"(r).
The application
of
this rule laid down
by
Littleton
,
is
sometimes
not unattended
with
difficulty
,
arising from the varied
forms
in
which
a
gift
to
several
persons may
be
made
(s).
Upon these principles
,
of
a
thorough and intimate union
of
interest
and
possession
,
depend
many
other
conse-
quences
and incidents
to
the joint
-
tenant's
estate
.
If
two
joint
-
tenants make
a
verbal lease
of
their land
,
reserving
rent
to
be paid
to
one
of
them
,
it
shall enure
to
both
,
in
respect
of
the joint reversion
(t).
If
their lessee
surrenders
his
lease
to
one of them
,
it
shall also enure
to
both
,
be-
cause
of
the privity
,

of
their estate

In all actions also relating
to their joint estate , one joint-
tenant cannot sue or be sued without joining the other (a).
But if two or more joint -tenants be seised of an advowson ,
and they present different clerks , the bishop may refuse to
admit either
because
neither joint - tenant hath a several
right of patronage , but each is seised of the whole ; and if
they do not both agree within six months , the right of pre-
sentation shall lapse.
But the ordinary may , if he pleases ,
admit
a clerk
presented by either , for the good of the
church , that divine
service may be regularly performed ;
which is no more than he otherwise would
be entitled
to
do, in case their disagreement continued so as
to incur a
lapse : and , if the clerk of one joint -tenant be so admitted ,
this shall keep up the title in both of them : in respect of
the privity and union of their
estate (b).

of it.
But one joint -tenant is not capable by himself to
do any act, which may tend to defeat or injure
the
estate
of the other , unless it be such an act as severs
the joint-
tenancy : thus he may not grant copyholds (d) : and if any
waste be
done , which tends to the destruction of the in-
heritance, one joint -tenant might have an action of waste
against the other, by construction of the statute Westm . 2,

c. 22 (e).
A joint-tenant
may make a valid lease of
his
share
,
a
dealing
of
this
kind
being
a
severance pro
tanto
(f).
Though
,
it
seems
,
that
if
a
rent
be
reserved
on
the lease
,
it
ceases with the life
of
the
grantor
(g
).
So
too
,
though
at
common law no action
of
account lay
for
one joint
-
tenant
against
another
,
unless he had
consti-
tuted him his bailiff
or
receiver
(h),
yet now by the statute
4
Ann
.
c.
16
,
joint
-
tenants may have actions
of
account
against
each other
,
for receiving
more than their
due
share
of
the profits
of
the tenements held
in
joint
-
tenancy
.
Though this action
is
rarely resorted
to
now
,
the
usual
remedy
being by suit
in
equity for
an
account
and
par-
tition
(?).
From
the same
principle
also
arises the
remaining
incident
of
joint estates
,
the most
important
of
all
,
viz
.,
the doctrine
of
survivorship
:
by which
,
when two
or
more
persons are seised
of
a
joint estate
of
inheritance
,
for their
own lives
,
or
pur autre vie
,
or
are jointly possessed
of
any
chattel
-
interest
,
the entire
tenancy
upon the
decease
of
any
of
them
remains
to
the survivors
,
and
at
length
to
the last survivor
;
and he shall
be entitled to the whole
estate
,
whatever
it
be
,
whether an inheritance
,
or
a
common
freehold
only
,
or
even
a
less
estate
(k).
This
is
the
natural
and regular
consequence
of
the union and entirety
of
their interest
.
The interest
of
two joint
-
tenants
is
not
only equal
or
similar
,
but also
is
one and the same
.
One
has not originally
a
distinct
moiety from the
other
;
but
,
if
by any subsequent act
(
as
by alienation
or
forfeiture
of
either
)
the
interest
becomes
separate
and distinct
,
the
joint
-
tenancy instantly ceases
.
But while
it
continues
,
each
of
two joint

tenants has
a
concurrent interest

whole ; and therefore , on the death of his companion , the
sole interest in the whole remains to the survivor .
For
the interest which
the survivor
originally
had is clearly
not devested by the
death of his
companion ;
and
no
other person
can now claim
to have a joint -estate with
him,
for
no
one can now have
an
interest
in
the whole
,
accruing by the same title
,
and taking
effect
at
the same
time with his own
;
neither
can any one claim
a
separate
interest
in
any part
of
the tenements
;
for that would
be
to
deprive the survivor
of
the right which
he has
in
all
,
and every part
.
As
therefore
the
survivor's
original
interest
in
the whole still remains
;
and
as
no
one
can
now
be
admitted
,
either jointly
or
severally
,
to
any share
with him therein
;
it
follows
,
that his own interest must
now
be
entire and
several
,
and that he shall alone be
entitled
to
the whole
estate
(
whatever
it
be
)
that
was
created
by the
original
grant
,
and
that free from
any
claim
of
dower
or
of
curtesy
on account
of
the
interest
that was
in
the deceased joint
-
tenant
(7).
The right
of
survivorship
is
called
by
our
ancient
authors
(
m)
the jus
accrescendi
,
because
the right upon
the death
of
one joint
-
tenant
accumulates
and
increases
to
the survivors
:
or
,
as
they themselves
express
it
,
"
pars illa
communis
accrescit
superstitibus
,
de
persona
in
personam
,
usque
ad ultimam
superstitem
."
The right
of
survivorship
,
since
it
operates sometimes with consider-
able hardship
upon the representatives
of
him who dies
first
,
is
not looked
upon with great favour
,
although
it
is
too well
established
to
be disregarded
in
any but excep-
tional cases
.
But where
it
has been found
practicable
this has been done
.
Thus courts
of
equity have held that
if
two persons
lend
money jointly
upon
a
mortgage
,
although the land
be
conveyed
to
them
as
joint
tenants
and the contract
be
with them jointly
,
yet the represen-
tatives of him
who dies first
are
entitled
to the
money

equally with the survivor .
Again , if land
be purchased
by several persons who
pay for it in unequal
shares , in
equity they will be held
not to be joint tenants , whatever
the form of the conveyance
.
This is not the
case , how-
ever , when the price is paid in equal shares , it being then
considered that they all take an equal chance , which
could
not be in the former case .
We
are, lastly, to
inquire
how an
estate in joint-
how severed tenancy may be severed and destroyed .
And this may
be done by destroying
its constituent
unities .
That of
time , indeed, which respects only the original commence-
ment of the joint
estate ,
cannot
(being
now
past )
be
affected by any subsequent transactions .
But
the joint-
tenants ' estate
may
be destroyed , without any
aliena-
tion , by merely disuniting their
possession.
For joint-
tenants being
seised per my et per tout , everything
that
tends to narrow that interest , so that they shall not be
seised
throughout
the whole and throughout
every part,
is a severance
or destruction of the jointure.
And there-
fore , if two joint-tenants
agree to part
their
lands , and
hold them in severalty , and
carry their
intentions
into
effect
by
a
deed , they
are no longer
joint -tenants : for
they have now no joint -interest
in the whole , but only
a several interest
respectively
in the several parts.
And
for that reason also, the right of survivorship
is by such
separation
destroyed (n).
By common law all the joint-
tenants might agree
to make partition
of the lands , but
one of them could not compel the other so to do (o) : for
this being
an
estate
originally
created
by the act
and
agreement of the parties , the law would
not permit
any
one
or
more of them to destroy
the united
possession
without
a similar universal
consent (p) .

legislature
enabled joint -tenants
to compel
a partition
under a writ framed for the purpose (q) , which , however ,
proving inconvenient
and dilatory , although the proceed-
ing was improved by later enactments , fell into disuse (r) .
Ultimately
the writ was abolished ( s) , and a partition
has
ever since been effected
by a suit in
chancery , whenever
the joint -owners , either through unwillingness
or personal
disability ,
cannot
obtain
that
end
by
voluntary
action .
The court
issues
a commission
to make partition of the
property , first , however , usually giving the parties liberty
to make proposals .
The
difficulty
of making
a satisfac-
tory division
has
never
been
a
reason for refusing
to
exercise
the jurisdiction
, for in one case the commissioners
made a partition of a house by assigning all the chimneys
and fireplaces , the only staircase, and the conveniences in
the yard , to
one
of the parties
( t) .
The inconveniences
The court
attending a partition of this kind have led to the legislature
order a sale.
giving power to the court to order a sale instead of parti-
tion where
such a course is proper (u).
This applies not
only to partition between joint tenants , but to all cases
of partition .
Thirdly , the jointure may be destroyed by Alienation .
destroying
the unity of title .
As if one joint
tenant
alienes and conveys his estate to a third person : here the
joint
tenancy is
severed , and
turned
into tenancy in
common , for the grantee and the remaining
joint tenant
hold by different
titles ,
one
(derived from the
original ,
the other from the subsequent grantor ) , though , till par-
tition
made , the unity of possession continues .
But
a
devise of one's share by will is no
severance
of the join-
ture : for no testament takes
effect till after the death of
the testator , and by such death the right of the survivor
(which
accrued at the original
creation of the estate , and

therefore
a priority
to the
other (x) )
is
already
vested (y). If, however , a joint -tenant devises his interest ,
and
afterwards
severs the
joint
tenancy , the
several
estate will pass (~).
(4. ) It may
also
be
destroyed
by
destroying the unity of interest .
And
therefore , if there
be two joint -tenants for life, and the inheritance
is pur-
chased
by or
descends
upon
either , it is
a severance
of
the jointure (a ) ; though , if an estate is originally limited
to two for life , and after to the heirs of one of them , the
freehold shall remain in jointure , without
merging in the
inheritance ; because , being
created by one and the same
conveyance, they are not separate estates (which
is
requi-
site
in
order to a merger ) , but branches of
one
entire
estate (6) .
In like manner , if a joint tenant in fee makes
a lease for life of his
share, this
defeats
the jointure
(c) :
for it destroys
the unity both
of title
and
of interest .
Though
in this
case if the
lessee
for life dies in the life-
time of all those
who
were joint
tenants ,
their
former
joint estate
revives (d) .
And
whenever
or by whatever
means the jointure ceases or is severed , the right of sur-
vivorship
or jus accrescendi
the
same
instant ceases with
it (e).
Yet, if one of three joint tenants alienes his
share ,
the two remaining
tenants still
hold their parts by joint
tenancy and survivorship (f) : and if one of three joint
tenants
releases
his
share
to
one of
his
companions
,
though the joint - tenancy is destroyed with regard to that

part, yet the two remaining
parts
are still held in join-
ture (g); for they still preserve
their original
constituent
unities .
But when , by any act or event, different interests
are created in the several parts of the estate , or they are
held by different titles , or if merely the possession is sepa-
rated ;
so that the tenants have no longer these four in-
dispensable
properties , a sameness
of interest , and undi-
vided possession , a title vesting at one and the same time ,
and by one and the same act

ship is taken
away , and each may transmit
his own part
to his own heirs .
Joint -tenancy , therefore , rarely
exists
except in the case of trustees ; there it is obviously a very
convenient
mode of
holding the trust property
which
remains in possession of the survivors and survivor , subject
to the
trusts .
Therefore , where money
is advanced by
several trustees upon mortgage , it is usual to insert in the
mortgage
deed a clause to prevent
the
operation of the
equitable
doctrine
above-mentioned , as to the money not
surviving .
Sometimes , however , it is disadvantageous to
dissolve the joint -estate
as if there be joint -tenants for
life, and they make partition
, this dissolves the jointure
;
and , though before each of them had
an
estate
in the
whole for his own life and the life of his companion , now
he
has
an
estate
in a moiety
only for
his
own
life ;
and , on
the death of either , the reversioner
shall
enter
on his
moiety (h) .
And
therefore , if there
were
two
joint-tenants for life, and one granted
away his part for
the life of his companion , it used to be a forfeiture (¿) : for ,
in the first
place , by the severance of the jointure he had
given himself in his own moiety only an estate for his own
life ; and then the grant was of the same land for the life of
another, which grant by a tenant for his own life merely ,

of in-
heritance
descend
from
the
ancestor to two
or
more
persons .
It arises either by common law or particular
custom .
By common law : as where
a person
seised
in
fee-simple or in fee -tail dies, and his next heirs
are two
or more females , his daughters , sisters , aunts , cousins , or
their
representatives ; in this
case
they shall
all inherit ,
as will be more fully shown , when we treat of descents
hereafter ; and these
co-heirs are then called coparceners
;
or, for brevity , parceners
only (1) .
Parceners
by parti-
cular custom
are where lands descend , as in gavelkind , to
all the males in equal
degree , as
sons , brothers , uncles ,
&c. (m).
And , in either of these cases
all the parceners
put together make but one heir ; and have but one estate
among them(n).
The
properties of parceners
are in some respects like
those of joint -tenants ; they having
the same unities of
interest , title , and possession.
They may sue and be sued
jointly for matters
relating
to their own
lands ( 0) ; and
the entry of one of them in some cases enured as the entry
(k) Co. Litt. 252.
(7) Litt. s. 241, 242.
(m) Ib. s. 265.
(2) Therefore
coparceners are en-
titled to be admitted
to
copyhold
tenements
as
one heir, and
upon
payment of one set of fees.

A very subtle
distinction is
taken
between coparcenary
at com-
mon law, and a customary
partible
descent . " Well said Littleton , ' by
the custom ,' for
sons are parceners
in respect of the custom of the
fee
or inheritance ,
and
not in respect
of their persons , as daughters
and
sisters , &c., be. 'Et sunt parti-

of them all (p ) , though , as we have seen , the possession of
one is not now that of all (q) .
They cannot have an action
of trespass against each other : but herein they differ from
joint-tenants , that they are also excluded
from maintain-
ing an action of waste (r) : for coparceners could

Parceners
also
differ
materially
from
joint-
tenants
in
four
other
points
:
1.
They
always
claim by
descent
,
whereas
joint
-
tenants
always claim by purchase
.
Therefore
,
if
two
sisters
purchase
lands
,
to
hold
to
them
and
their
heirs
,
they
are
not
parceners
,
but
joint-
tenants
(s)
and hence
it
likewise
follows
,
that
no
lands
can
be
held
in
coparcenary
,
but
estates
of
inheritance
,
which
are
of
a
descendible
nature
;
whereas
not only
estates
in
fee and
in
tail
,
but for life
or
years
,
may be
held
in
joint
-
tenancy
.
2.
There
is
no
unity
of
time
necessary
to
an
estate
in
coparcenary
.
For
if
a
man Unity

has

severed by partition , they are no longer parceners ,
but tenants in severalty ; or if one parcener
alienes her
share , though no partition be made , then are the lands
no
longer held in coparcenary , but in common (x).
Parceners may convey to each other either by feoffment
or grant or release, because their seisin is to some extent
joint
and to some several (y) .
On the
other hand, the
only mode of conveyance from one joint tenant to another
is by release , each
being
seised
of the whole (z) .
Again ,
a tenant in common may enfeoff his co-tenant , or make
a
grant to him, but a release is ineffectual
to pass the free-
hold , which in this case is several (a) .
Partitions are now
always
made by mutual conveyances
, even when
made
under
a
decree
of the
court.
Formerly parceners
of a
copyhold could
not make partition
without
the consent of
the lord, but this is not now requisite (b) .
Parceners derive their name (according to Littleton (c) )
from the fact
they could
always
be constrained
to make
partition.
And he mentions
many
methods
of making
it (d)
four of which are by consent , and one by compul-
sion .
The first is , where they agree to divide
the lands
into
equal
parts
in severalty , and
that
each shall have
such
a determinate part (e) .
The
second is, when they
agree to choose
some friend
to make partition for them ,
and then the sisters shall choose
each of them her part
according
to seniority of age ; or otherwise ,
as
shall
be
agreed.
The privilege of seniority is in this case personal ;
for if the eldest
sister be
dead , her issue shall not choose

first , but the next sister .
But , if an advowson descend in
coparcenary , and the sisters cannot agree in the presenta-
tion ,
the
eldest and
her
issue , nay her husband , or her
assigns , shall present alone , before the younger (f) .
And
the reason given is , that the former
privilege
of priority
in choice upon a division , arises from
an act of her own ,
the agreement to make partition
; and therefore is merely
personal : the latter , of presenting
to the living , arises
from the act of the law, and is annexed not only to her
person , but to her
estate
also.
A third method of par-
tition
is , where
the
eldest divides ,
and then she shall
choose last ; for the rule of law is , cujus est divisio , alterius
est electio .
The fourth method
is where the sisters
agree
to cast lots for their shares.
The
method by compulsion
was, where
one or
more
sued out
a writ of partition
against
the
others ;
whereupon
the sheriff
went to the
lands , and made partition
thereof by the verdict of a jury
there impanneled , and assigned to each of the parceners her
part in severalty .
The writ is now abolished , and the only
method
applicable
for compulsory
partition of lands held
in parcenary is the same
as in that above
described for the
case ofjoint tenancy .
But there
are
some things which are in their
nature
not easily susceptible of partition
; the court would now in
these
cases , probably , order
a sale.
Formerly, it either
proceeded (as we have shown ) in a somewhat whimsical
manner
to compel the parties
to agree to
a
sale , or it
gave the eldest sister , if she pleased
, the right of user , she
making to the others a reasonable satisfaction in other
parts of the inheritance ;
or if that
could
not
be , then
the
sisters were allowed to have the profits of the thing
by turns , in the
same
manner
as they took
an advow-

son (g) .
These
methods
were frequently
adopted
where
the subject matter
was a mansion -house or common of
estovers
or of piscary
uncertain , or any other
common ,
without
stint.
After
a partition
the
former
parcener
holds his shares in severalty , but continues
to be entitled
by descent (h) .
The
importance
of this
will
be
seen
when the law of descent
comes
to be
considered . If,
however , the partition
be effected
by a conveyance to the
use of a third person , and then a reconveyance by him
to
the parceners of their
several
shares, the effect will
be
different , and this is the usual and proper mode of effect-
ing a partition by coparceners.
There is yet another consideration
attending
the estate
in coparcenary : that if one of the daughters
has had an
estate
given with her in frankmarriage
by her ancestor ,
(which we may remember
was
a
species
of estates -tail ,
freely given
by a relation
for advancement of his kins-
woman by marriage ( ) ) , in this
case , if lands
descend
from
the same ancestor
to her
and
her
sisters
in
fee
simple ,
she or her
heirs
shall
have
no share of them ,
unless
they will
agree
to
divide
the lands
so given
in
frankmarriage
in equal
proportion
with the rest of the
lands
descending ( ) .
This mode of division
was known
in the law of the Lombards ( ) ; which directs the woman
so preferred in marriage , and
claiming
her share of the
inheritance ,
mittere
in confusum
cum
sororibus, quantum
pater aut frater ei dederit, quando ambulaverit ad maritum.
With
us it is
denominated
bringing
those lands
into
hotch -pot (m ) :
which term I shall
explain
in the very
words of Littleton (n) : " it seemeth that this word hotch-
pot, is in English

; for

commonly put one thing alone , but one thing with other
things
together ."
By this
housewifely
metaphor
our
ancestors
meant to inform us (0) ,
that
the lands ,
both
those given in frankmarriage
and those descending in fee
simple , should be mixed and blended
together , and then
divided in equal portions
among all the daughters .
But
this was left to the choice of the donee
in frankmarriage
:
and if she did not choose
to put her lands into hotch -pot ,
she was presumed to be sufficiently
provided for , and the
rest
of the
inheritance
was
divided
among
her
other
sisters .
The law of hotch -pot took place then only , when
the other
lands
descending
from
the ancestor
were fee
simple ; for ifthey descended
in tail, the donee
in frank-
marriage was entitled
to her share, without bringing her
lands
so given
into hotch -pot (p) .
And the reason
is ,
because
lands descending in fee simple
are distributed
by
the policy of law , for the maintenance of all the daughters ;
and if one has a sufficient
provision
out of the
same
inheritance , equal to the rest , it is not reasonable that she
should have
more :
but lands
descending in tail are not
distributed by the operation of the law, but by the desig-
nation
of the giver , per formam
doni : it matters
not
therefore
how unequal this distribution
may be .
Also no
lands , but
such
as are given in frankmarriage
, shall
be
brought into hotch -pot ; for no others are looked upon in
law as given for the advancement of the woman , or by way
of marriage portion (q) .
And therefore , as gifts in frank-
marriage
are fallen
into disuse , we should
hardly have
mentioned
the law of hotch -pot , had not this
method of
division been revived and copied by the
statute
for
dis-
tribution

How

the interest ; or by the whole
at last
descending
to and
vesting in one single
person , which brings it to an
estate
in severalty.
Tenants in common
are
such
as hold by several
and
distinct
titles , but by unity of possession ; because
none
knoweth his own severalty , and therefore they all occupy
promiscuously
(r) .
This tenancy therefore happens where
there
is
a unity of possession merely , but
perhaps
an
entire disunion of interest , of title, and of time .
For if
there be two tenants in common of lands , one may hold
his
part in fee
simple , the
other in tail , or for life ;
so
that there is no necessary unity of interest : one may hold
by descent, the other by purchase ; or the one by purchase
from A. , the other by purchase from B.; so that
there is
no unity of title : the estate
of one may have been vested
fifty years , that of the
others but yesterday ;
so there
is
no unity of time .
The only unity there is , is that of pos-
session ;
and for this
Littleton
gives the true
reason ,
because
no man
can certainly tell which part is his own :
otherwise even this would
be soon destroyed .
Tenancy in common
may be
created ,
either
by the
destruction of the two other estates , in joint -tenancy and
coparcenary ,
or
by special limitation
in a deed , or by a
conveyance
of an undivided
share by the owner
of the
whole .
By the destruction
of the
two
other
estates ,
is
meant
such
a destruction
as
does not sever the unity of
possession, but only the unity of title
or interest : Thus,
if one of two joint -tenants in fee alienes his estate for the
life of the alienee , the alienee and the other joint -tenant
are tenants in common ;
for they now have several
titles ,
the other joint -tenant by the original grant , the
alienee
by the new alienation
(s) ; and they also have several
in-
terests , the former joint -tenant in fee -simple , the alienee
for his own life only .
So, if one joint - tenant
gives
his
(r) Litt . s. 293.
(s) 1b. s. 292.


TENANCY
IN COMMON .
363
part to A. in tail, and the other gives his
to
B. in tail ,
the donees
are tenants in common , as holding by different
titles and conveyances (t). If one of two parceners alienes ,
the
alienee and the remaining
parcener
are tenants in
common (u) ;
because
they
hold
by
different
titles , the
parcener
by descent, the alienee by purchase .
So like-
wise , if there be a grant to two men , or two women , and
the heirs of their bodies , here the grantees shall be joint-
tenants of the life estate , but they shall have several in-
heritances
; because they cannot possibly have one heir of
their two bodies,
as
might have been
the
case had the
limitation
been
to a man
and woman , and the heirs of
their bodies begotten (x)
and in this , and the like cases ,
their
issues
shall
be tenants
in common ;
because
they
must claim by different titles , one
as heir of A. , and the
other
as heir of B.; and those two not titles by purchase ,
but descent.
In short ,
whenever
an
estate in joint-
tenancy
or coparcenary is dissolved , so that there be no
partition made, but the unity of possession continues , it
is turned into a tenancy in common .
favoured a
tenancy
A tenancy in common
may also be created
by express
limitation in a deed ;
but here care must be taken not to
insert
words
which imply
a joint
estate
;
and then if
lands be given to two or more , and it be not joint - tenancy ,
it must be a tenancy in common .
The law was formerly
The law
apt in its
constructions
to favour joint -tenancy
rather joint
than tenancy in common ( y) ;
because
the divisable ser- formerly.
vices issuing from land
(as rent , &c. ) are not divided , nor
the entire services
(as fealty ) multiplied
by joint -tenancy ,
as
they
must necessarily be upon
a tenancy in common .
These
reasons
have, however , long
ceased
to be of any
validity , and now the tendency is quite the other way (~).
Land given to two , to be holden the one moiety to one, But not
and the
other
moiety
to
the
other , is
an
estate

now.

common (a) ; and , if one grants to another half his land ,
the grantor and grantee are also tenants in common
(b) ;
because , as has been before (c) observed
, joint -tenants
do
not take by distinct
halves
or
moieties ;
and
by
such
grants
the division
and
severalty
of the
estate is so
plainly expressed that it is impossible
they should take a
joint -interest in the whole of the tenements .
Again , where lands are given to two persons in different
capacities , without
words of division , they will take
as
tenants in common , for they cannot take as joint -tenants .
Thus , if the
donees
be one a corporation and the other a
natural person , or one by the king in his royal capacity
and a subject , the tenancy is not joint , but in common
(d) .
In a will, the
construction
of which is less strict than
that of a deed , any gift , imputing a division
or distribu-
tion (e) , or containing
words denoting equality of interest ,
will confer a tenancy in common (f).
The
meaning will
be gathered from the whole will, and the words imme-
diately
constituting
the gift may
be controlled
by the
context (g).
In
deeds
operating
under
the
Statute
of
Uses ,
a
similar liberality of interpretation
has been allowed as in
wills (h) ; and , as most deeds conveying
estates
to various
persons
are of this
character , it may be said
to be the
general rule , and probably a common law conveyance would
now be construed in a like manner ( ) , but it is the most

usual
as well
as the safest
way, when
a tenancy in
common is meant to be created , to add express words of ex-
clusion as well as description , and limit the estate to A. and
B. , to hold as tenants in common , and not as joint -tenants .
As to the
incidents
attending
a tenancy in common : Incidents.
tenants in common (like joint - tenants ) are compellable in
equity to make partition of their lands (k) . They properly
take by distinct moieties , and have no entirety of interest :
and therefore there is no survivorship
between tenants
in
common .
For , though
a tenancy in common for life may
be
created and the
benefit
of survivorship
may , by a
devise
over ,
be
added , yet
this
will
not
create
a joint-
tenancy , but the devise over gives a contingent
interest to
the survivor . " Survivorship
is not the only characteristic
of a joint-tenancy " (/) .
The other incidents
are such
as merely
arise from the
unity of possession
, and are therefore the same as apper-
tain
to joint-tenants
merely
upon
that account :
such
as
being liable
to
reciprocal
actions
of waste ,
and of
account , by the statutes of Westm. 2 , c. 22 , and 4 Ann ,
c. 16.
For by the common

Yet mere occupation by one tenant in common , if un-
accompanied by
exclusion
of his
co - tenants ,
does
not
render him liable for rent
to them ( p) ;
but if there
be
exclusion this is otherwise (q) .
Those
incidents
of joint -tenants
which arise from the
privity
of title
and
entirety
of interests ,
are
not
for
the
most part applicable
to tenants
in
common : thus
tenants in common
need
not generally
sue jointly , since
they have several titles (r) ;
though
for
injuries
to their
common
property
as
trespass
quare clausum fregit , or a
nuisance , or similar wrongs
done to the property
of all ,
they should all be parties to the action (s) :
and so if the
object be the
recovery of a common
right,
as for rent
reserved by them , or waste upon a lease for years .
But
if waste be committed where there is no lease by them
all , the action by one alone is good (t).
Tenancy in common can only be put an end to in two
ways - 1 . By uniting all the titles
and interests in one
tenant , by purchase or otherwise ; which brings the whole
to one severalty .
2.
By making
partition
between the
several tenants in common , which gives them all respec-
tive
severalties .
For tenancies
in
common
differ
in
nothing
from
sole
estates , except in having
the
pecu-
liarity of unity of possession.

THE foregoing
chapters having been principally em- Title to
ployed in defining the nature of things real , in describing
the tenures by which they
may be holden , and in dis-
tinguishing the several kinds of estate
or interest
that
may be had therein ; we come next to consider , lastly , the
title

manner
of acquiring
and
losing it.

A title is thus
defined by sir Edward
Coke (a), titulus Title

;
or
,
it
is
the
means
whereby
the
owner
of
lands
has the just
possession of his
property
.
A
complete
title involves
the two
elements
,
the fact
of
possession
,
and the right
to
the possession
.
When
the
subject
matter
is
such
that
there
is
no
possession
applicable
,
as
when the title
to
an
estate
in
lands
,
in
reversion
or
remainder
,
is
spoken
of
,
an
undis-
puted and
indisputable
right
to
it
constitutes all that
is
involved
in
the name title
;
but
in
such
a
case we do not
say that the title
to
the lands
is
complete until the estate
falls
into
possession
and the owner
of
the estate obtains
legal possession

by
personal

or
that

THE TITLE

GENERAL .
in the mere naked possession
, or actual occupation of the
estate ;
without
any
right to hold
and
continue
such
possession beyond that which
the
fact of such possession
affords.
This may happen when
one man
invades
the
possession of another , and by force or surprise
turns him
out of the occupation of his lands ; which is termed
a dis-
Disseisin
seisin , being
a deprivation
of that actual
seisin , or cor-
poral
freehold
of
the
lands , which the
tenant
before
enjoyed .
Or it may happen , that
after
the death of the
ancestor and before the
entry
of the heir, or after
the
death of a particular
tenant
and before the entry of him
in remainder or reversion , a stranger may contrive to get
possession of the vacant land , and hold out him that had
a right to enter.
In
all which
cases , and many
others
that might be here
suggested , the wrongdoer
has only a
mere naked possession
, which the rightful owner may put
an end to by those
remedies which
the law provides, as
will more fully
appear in the third
book of these com-
mentaries .
But , in the meantime , till some act be done by
the rightful owner to divest this possession and assert his
title, such actual possession is , primâ facie , evidence
of a
legal
title in the possessor, so that , speaking
generally,
the burden of proof of title is thrown upon any one who
claims to oust him : this possessory title, moreover , may,
by length
of time
and
negligence
of him who
had the
right , by degrees ripen
into a perfect
and
indefeasible
title.
And at all
events , without such actual possession ,
no title can be completely good .
Right of
possession.
For
The other part of a good and perfect title is the right
of possession, which may
reside in one man , while the
actual possession is not in himself but in another.
if a man be disseised , or otherwise kept out of possession ,
by any of the means before mentioned , though the actual
possession be lost, yet he has still
remaining
in him the
right of possession ; and may exert it whenever he thinks
proper, by entering
upon the disseisor , and turning him

of
mere barren right , unproductive
of beneficial
enjoyment .
In other words the right of possession must
be equally
indisputable
in a court of equity as
a court of law.
This
beneficial
ownership
or freedom
from
any binding
trust,
may be described as the right of property , although
it is
not the sense in which that phrase was formerly
used (1).
Next, the land must
be free from any
incumbrance
or
other claim ; the nature of which , when , like mortgages ,
they depend upon contract , has been sufficiently
discussed ;
and their character , when arising
in invitum by process
law on the part of
a creditor , will
be presently
treated .
As to claims , generally , we
need
here only add
that
a
purchaser
buying
with an
apparently
good
title , is
not
bound by those
of
which
he has no notice
,
and
in
respect
of which
no

Formerly
the right

and
the
right
of

were
held distinct
in
courts
of law
by
reason of the different
kinds of real
action which existed
,
in some
of
which the right
of
pos-
session
was
determined
without
fully determining
the right
of

in
him by his own act or agreement (a) ;
and , thirdly , by
escheat , of which
we shall
see more presently (b) .
There
are also some modes of vesting which for some purposes
are considered
as falling under
the general
term
pur-
chase , but for
other
purposes
must
be
distinguished
from it.
They are where the title vests through
partition
or inclosure , which , by the recent act to amend the law
of inheritance , are distinguished
from purchase .
Descent , or hereditary
succession , is the title whereby
a man on the death of another acquires his estate by right
of representation ,
as
his
heir -at-law.
An
heir
is
he
upon whom
the law casts
the
estate
immediately
on the
death of the ancestor
and an estate , so descending to the
heir , is in law called the inheritance .

The doctrine of descents
, or law of inheritances in fee-

importance
; and is
in-

of
the laws

gift in tail , or to a man
and the
heirs of his body , is
a limitation that cannot be perfectly understood without
a
previous knowledge of the law of descents
in fee -simple .
One may well perceive that this is an estate confined in
its
descent
to
such heirs only
of
the donee
as
have sprung
or
shall spring
from
his body
;
but who those heirs
are
,

(
among the males
)
whether the eldest

or
all the
sons together
,
shall
be

;
this
is
a
point that we must
refer back
to
the
standing
law
of
descents
in
fee

simple
to
be
informed
of
.
Since
,
in
the year
1833
,
an
act
(c)
was passed mate-
rially altering
the rules
of
descent
as
regards the inherit-
ance accruing upon the death
of
any person who may have
died since
the
31st
of
December
,
1833
,
we will
,
in
this
chapter
,
exhibit the
present law
of
inheritance
,
briefly
noting by the way the rules which formerly
prevailed but
do
so
no
longer
,
the importance
of
which
,
in
connection
with existing
titles
to
land
,
is
now nearly extinct
(d).
The alterations
in
the law made by the act alluded
to
apply
to
every kind
of
hereditament

whether
it
be
subject
to
the common law
of
England
or
to

who last
acquired the property otherwise than by descent , or than
by escheat , partition , or inclosure , by the effect of which
the property " shall have become
part of,
or
descend-
ible in the
same
manner
as
other
land
acquired
by
descent " (g).
Moreover , it is
enacted
(h), that when
any land
shall
have been limited by an assurance executed after the 31st
of December ,
1833 , to the person ,
or the heirs
of the
person , who shall thereby have conveyed the land , such
person shall be
considered to have acquired the land as a
purchaser
by virtue
of such assurance , and shall
not
be
entitled thereto as his former estate (i).
This first rule
or canon is an alteration of the former
law under which the person who last died actually
seised
of the property constituted the stirps or stock from
whom
descent was to be traced : the maxim
being
seisina facit
stipitem
and a person was only considered actually
seised
when he had himself , or by his own or his ancestor's lessee
entered , or had received rent from the lessee (k).
The rule which is now in force is not free from
objec-
tion ,
and it may be remarked
is not in accordance
with
the
recommendation
of the real property commissioners ,

(i) The
doctrine
before the
act
was that when
there was
a devise
to the testator's
heir , the devisee
was
considered to take the land by
his
prior title
as
heir,
and
not
under the will , unless the testator
altered the estate, and limited
it in
a manner
different
from

in
which it would

RULES
OF DESCENT .
375
upon whose first report the Inheritance Act was to a great
extent founded .
They recommended that descent should
be always
traced from the person last entitled , a simpler .
and more convenient
arrangement ,
as the title , when it
depends
upon the inability to show whether or not a pro-
posed stirps
inherited , must
always
be in
some degree
uncertain . It has been held , however , that another objec-
tion which seems
not unnaturally
to arise out of this rule
is invalid.
Suppose
a purchaser to die intestate , leaving
two daughters ,
Elizabeth
and
Mary.
Then
suppose
Elizabeth to die, without
having in any manner dealt with
her
share
,
and
leaving
a
son
,
it
might
seem that
the
descent
of
the moiety which
Elizabeth took
,
ought
,
if
in
accordance
with the rule
it
be traced from the purchaser
,
go
as
to
half only
to
her son and the remainder
to
Mary
.
It
has
been
held
in
accordance with
a
natural
sense of
what under
such circumstances would
appear
fair
,
that
the moiety
in
question
descends
entirely
to
the son
(7).
Although the
rule
declares
that
the descent
is
to
be
traced
,
not from the person who was last entitled
or
pos-
sessed
,
but from
the person who last
took by purchase
,
yet
a
person who has taken
by descent may
in
several
ways
so
change his
estate
or
acquire
a
new estate
,
as
to
constitute
himself for the purposes
of
further
devolution
of
title
a
purchaser
,
or
"
break the descent
"
as
it
is
termed
.
But
as
to
what dealings
with the
estate will have this
effect
,
questions
of
some nicety sometimes arise
.
Before the recent act the law distinguished
between the
cases where
a
man who died intestate seised of lands
had
inherited
them from his father and where from his mother
;
and
if
the intestate had inherited from his mother then the
heir was
to
be
sought
ex
parte maternâ
as
it
was called
(
m
).
Thus
,
if
Mary Farrifield was
seised
of
law
,
and having
married
John
Sandie
,
died
a
widow
,
leaving
a
son Wil-
liam Sandie
;
William
Sandie
,
being his mother's
heir-

at-law, succeeded
to the land . Ifthen William
Sandie died
seised intestate
and without having
in any manner
dealt
with the land , the descent was to be traced not
according
to the then usual rule from William
Sandie simpliciter as
the person last seised , but from William Sandie ex parte
materna through
the mother's blood .
It will be seen that
in some respects this was like the present rule of seeking
the heir by descent from the last purchaser
and
not the
last person who
died
seised.
Now it was
held
as a
settled doctrine that William
Sandie , in the
case we have
put,
could in many ways
break
the
descent ,
so
as to
constitute
himself
a stock of descent according
to the
common rule .
Thus , if he made a feoffment in fee , so as
to part with the
estate
absolutely and then took a recon-
veyance, the descent was broken (n) , but if he
made
a
conveyance for the purpose of creating
particular
estates ,
and limited the ultimate
fee to himself, this was held to
be the same estate that he had before and it descended
to the heir ex parte
maternâ.
The
estate which is taken
back
must be in reality
a new estate , and not merely a
part of the
old
estate , unless it comes
within the enact-
ment already quoted (o) .
The same principles
now apply
to determine by what means a person who has inherited
may constitute
himself
a purchaser (p) .

Where

much hardship might
ensue without the provision
which
it makes .
Thus , if lands descend from a foundling
to his
issue , then on failure of such issue there would
be no heir ,
yet the person who last enjoyed the land might through
his maternal ancestors have an heir , to whom naturally it
would
seem the lands
ought
to descend
rather than that
there should
be an escheat.
Accordingly
this provision.
was introduced by a recent act to meet such a case (q) .
ritance
issue of
and then to
ancestors.
II. The second
rule is that an inheritance
shall descend
(II.) Inhe-
to the issue of the
last purchaser , and that
on
failure of descendsto
issue of the last purchaser , the inheritance shall go to his purchaser,
lineal
ancestors , or their
issue ;
each of the
ancestors lineal
taking in preference to his issue , but so that a nearer lineal
ancestor and his issue are to be preferred to a more remote
lineal ancestor
and
his
issue
other
than
such
nearer
ancestor or his issue (r).
This rule , as regards the latter
part of it, was a great change from the former
rule of
descent in
which
no
parent
or
other
lineal
ancestor
could
be
heir-a rule
probably
founded
on feudal
rea-
For it was an express rule of the feudal law (s) ,
that
successionis
feudi
talis
est natura , quod ascendentes
non succedunt ;
and therefore
the same maxim
obtained
sons .
(q) In Doe v. Blackburn
, 1 Moo . &
Rob. 547, the case mentioned in the
text occurred , and the heir of the
last
owner
was
defeated
in
an
ejectment.
That case was prior to
22 & 23 Vict . c. 35 ; under the pre-
sent law, the
claim
would
have
been supported .
The difficulty was
foreseenby the
real
property
com-
missioners (1st Rep. p. 15), but not
provided for
by
the
Inheritance
Act.
For
some
further remarks
upon this part of the law of descent ,
seepost, p. 397.
(r) The words of the
act (3 & 4
Will . 4, c.
106,
s. 6) are " That
every lineal
ancestor
shall
be
capable of being
heir to any of his
issue ;
and in
every
case
where
there shall be no issue of the pur-
chaser , his nearest lineal ancestor
shall be his
heir , in preference to
any
person
who
would
have
been
entitled to inherit, either by tracing
his
descent
through
such
lineal
ancestor , or in consequence of there
being no descendant
of such lineal
ancestor ; so that the
father
shall
be preferred
to a brother
or sister ,
and a more
remote lineal ancestor
to
any of his issue, other
than
a
nearer lineal ancestor , or his issue ."

also in the French law till
recently (t) .
Our Henry I.,
indeed , among
other restorations of the
old
Saxon laws,
restored the right of succession in the ascending line (u):
but this soon fell again into disuse ; for so early as Glan-
vil's time , who wrote
under
Henry II. , we find
it laid
down as established law (x) , that hæreditas
nunquam
as-
cendit ; which remained an invariable
maxim , until altered
by the Inheritance
Act , so as
to accord
more with
our
sense of a natural
course of succession .
This rule has put an end to the
possibility
which for-
merly
not
uncommonly
existed , of
estates
which
have
once
vested afterwards
being
divested by the subsequent
birth of a nearer heir , with the
single
exception of the
case of a posthumous
child.
Formerly, when
an
estate
might descend
to a sister , or an uncle or aunt , during
the
lifetime of the father
or grandfather of the intestate , by
the birth, after any interval , however long , of a brother ,
or, as the
case might be, a sister or an uncle , the
estate
would devest and go to such nearer heir (y).
This can now
never happen , except in the
case
above noticed , because
all such cases supposed the existence of a lineal ancestor ,
who
now
would
take in priority to all
such
brothers ,
sisters, uncles , or aunts .
In the
case of a posthumous
child
alone , then , can this
devesting
now
take
place .
During the interval, before the birth of such child , the
rents and profits will now belong to the person who , but
for him, would
be heir , as was considered to be the case
formerly in the instances above noticed (~) .

III. The third rule , or canon of descent, is this : that (
III
)
Lincal
the lineal descendants
,
in
infinitum
,
of
any person deceased
represent
shall represent their ancestor
:
that
is
,
shall
stand
in
the cestor
in
same place
as
the person himself would have done
,
had he
been living
.
Thus
,
the child
,
grandchild
,
or
great
-
grandchild
,
either
male
or
female
,
of
the
eldest
son
,
succeeds
before the
younger
son
,
and
so
in
infinitum
(a).
And
these repre-
sentatives shall take neither
more nor
less
,
but just
so
much
as
their principals
would
have done
.
As
,
if
there
be
two sisters
,
Margaret
and Charlotte
;
and
Margaret
dies
,
leaving
six
daughters
;
and
then
John
Stiles
,
the
father
of
the two
sisters
,
dies without
other issue
:
these
six daughters shall take among them exactly the same
as
their mother
Margaret
would
have done
,
had
she
been
living
;
that
is,
a
moiety
of
the lands
of
John
Stiles
in
coparcenary
:
so
that
,
upon partition
made
,
if
the land be
divided into twelve
parts
Charlotte
the surviving
sister
shall have
six thereof
,
and her six nieces
,
the daughters
of
Margaret
,
one
a
piece
.
their an-
infinitum
.
called suc-
stirpes
;
This taking by representation
is
called
succession
in
Which
is
stirpes
,
according
to
the roots
;
since all the branches cession
in
inherit the
same share that their root
,
whom they repre-
sent
,
would have done
.
And in this manner also was the
Jewish succession directed
(b);
but the Roman somewhat
differed
from
it
.
In the
descending
line
,
the right
of
representation
continued
in
infinitum
,
and the inheritance
still
descended
in
stirpes
:
as
,
if
one
of
three daughters
died
,
leaving ten children
,
and then the father died
;
the
two surviving
daughters had each one
-
third
of
his effects
,
and the ten grandchildren
had the remaining third divided
between
them
.
And
so
among collaterals
,
if
any person
of
equal
degree with the persons represented
were still
subsisting
(
as
,
if
the
deceased
left one brother
,
and
two
nephews
,
the sons
of
another brother

still guided by the roots : but, if both the brethren
were
dead leaving
issue , then
their
representatives
in
equal
degree
became themselves
principals
,
and
shared
the
inheritance per capita , that is , share and share alike ; they
being themselves now the next in degree to the ancestor ,
in their own right , and not by right of representation (c).
So, if the next heirs of Titius be six
nieces , three by one
sister , two by another , and one by a third ; his inheritance
by the
Roman law was divided
into
six parts , and
one
given to each of the nieces : whereas the law of England
in this case would still divide it only into three parts , and
distribute
it per stirpes , thus :
one third to the three
children
who
represent
one sister , another third to the
two who
represent the second , and the remaining
third
to the
one child who is the sole representative
of her
mother .
Thus
also , as we have
seen , if one of several
parceners
dies leaving
issue, the share of the parcener
goes
to the issue , by virtue of the continued
right
of
representation (d).
The
rule
of
representation
is
applied
even in those
cases where by custom some of the other rules , which we
shall
presently notice , are
disregarded ;
as , for
instance ,
where the custom of Borough
English
exists , by which
the youngest son inherits in preference to the eldest (e) ,
or in gavelkind
lands , where all sons inherit equally (ƒ) .
So that if a purchaser of gavelkind
land dies
intestate ,
leaving
no issue
and no brother , but a nephew Thomas ,
and two grand - nephews , the
sons of William , a deceased
brother of Thomas , then Thomas
takes half, and
each of
the grand -nephews a quarter of the land (g) .

RULES
OF
DESCENT .
381
The application of the rule is governed by those other
rules of descent which
determine
the question
which of
the issue takes ; and by those special rules which custom
has established
for the particular
locus
in quo , different
from the common law.
This right of perpetual representation is an ancient rule
which seems
to have grown
general during the twelfth
century , and
seems
to have been more slowly introduced.
into the collateral , than the descending line .
In the time
of Henry II. , when Glanvil wrote , it does
not appear to
have
been
universally
admitted ,
though
that
author
appears
to declare in its favour
by holding
that the son
of an eldest son should inherit
in priority to his uncle , a
younger son of the
same
stock .
Frequent
contests took
place
between
relations , such of these as to inheritance ,
and especially
as to the title to the crown .
Many argu-
ments
were
urged ,
founded
on
the
superior
personal
ability of the
uncle
to
perform
the
duties
or
services
attaching to the
inheritance .
We are not
surprised
to
find that king John , who kept his nephew Arthur from
the throne , attempted
(h) to establish
the principle
that
the uncle
being
nearer to the
common
stock
had
the
superior right ; but in the time of his son Henry III. , we
see the
rule
treated
as
indisputably
settled ( )
in the
manner
in which it now
exists ,
and but few attempts
were afterwards made to shake it (k).
(h) Hale , H. C. L. 217, 229.
(i) Bracton , lib . 2, c. 30, s. 2.
(k) Dalrymple
on Feuds , c. 5, s.
2, cites as instances the contest de-
cided by Edward I. between
Bruce
and Baliol ; the rival claims of the
Duke of
Lancaster
and
Earl
of
March
on
the
abdication
of
Richard II.; and those of Cardinal
Bourbon and Henry of Navarre
to
the crown of France
on the death
of Henry III.
Edward III.'s claim
to the French
throne
was grounded
upon an alleged
right of represen-
tation , that he might
take
through
his mother , though
she was by the
Salic
law
excluded .
This
claim ,
however , even if the difficulty
of so
claiming
had
been
less
manifest ,
was clearly
bad upon the same prin-
ciple of representation , since a de-
scendant ,
also through
a
female
from
Edward's
eldest
uncle ,
was
alive .


382
TITLE
BY DESCENT .
(IV ) Males
IV. A fourth
general rule or canon is, that the male
preferred to
females.
issue shall be admitted before the female .
In what
countries
this rule
prevailed;
Thus
sons shall be
admitted
before daughters ; or , as
our male lawgivers
have somewhat uncomplaisantly
ex-
pressed it, the worthiest of blood
shall
be
preferred (1).
As if John Stiles has two sons, Matthew and Gilbert , and
two
daughters ,
Margaret
and Charlotte , and dies ; first
Matthew , and
(in
case of his
death without issue) then
Gilbert, shall be admitted to the succession , in preference
to both the daughters .
This preference of males to females is entirely
agreeable
to the law of succession
among
the Jews (m) ,
and also
among
the
states of
Greece ,
or
at
least
among
the
Athenians (n) ;
but
was
not
adopted
by the laws of
Rome (o) , (such of them at least as are at present extant ,)
wherein
brothers
and sisters were allowed
to succeed to
equal portions
of the inheritance (p).
Without entering
into the comparative merit of the Roman
and the other
constitutions
in
this
particular ,
or
examining
into the
alleged greater dignity of blood in the male or female sex :
arises from it is sufficient here to observe , that our preference of males
principles.
to females
seems to have arisen
entirely from the feudal
law.
For
though
our
British
ancestors ,
the
Welsh ,
appear to have given
a preference to males (9), yet our
Danish
predecessors
(who
succeeded
them ) seem to have
made no distinction
of sexes , but to have admitted all the
children
at
once
to the inheritance (r).
But the feudal

•
law of the Saxons on the continent
(which was probably
brought
over hither , and first altered by the law of king
Canute ) gives an evident preference of the male to the
female sex.

It
is
possible , therefore ,
that
this
preference
might
be a
branch of that imperfect
system of feuds , which obtained
here before the conquest : especially as it subsists
among
the customs of gavelkind , and
as , in the charter or laws
of king
Henry I. , it is not
(like
many
Norman
inno-
vations ) given
up ,
but
rather
enforced (t).
The
true
reason
of preferring
the males must
be deduced from
feudal principles
: for , by the genuine and original policy
of that constitution , no
female
could
ever
succeed
to a
proper feud (u), inasmuch
as they were incapable of per-
forming
those military services, for the sake of which that
system
was established .
But our law does not extend to
a total
exclusion of females , as the Salic law, and others ,
where feuds were most strictly retained : it only postpones
them to males ; for , though
daughters
are excluded by
sons , yet they
succeed
before any
collateral
relations ;
our law, like that of the Saxon feudists before mentioned ,
thus
steering
a middle course between the absolute
re-
jection
of females,
and the
putting
them
on a footing
with males .

the father , the

Margaret
and Charlotte
shall
both inherit the estate as coparceners (x).
This right of primogeniture in males seems
anciently
to
tions right
have only obtained among the Jews , in whose constitution
the eldest son had a double portion of the inheritance (y) ;
in the same manner
as with us, by the laws of king
Henry I. (2) , the eldest son had the capital
fee or principal
feud of his
father's
possessions ,
and no other pre-emi-
nence ;
and
as
the eldest
daughter
had
afterwards
the
principal
mansion , when the
estate
descended
in copar-
cenary (a ).
The
Greeks , the
Romans , the
Britons , the
Goths ,
Vandals ,
and
Franks ,
the
Saxons ,
and
even
originally the feudists , divided
the lands
equally ;
some
among all the children at large , some among the males only.
This is certainly the most obvious and natural way ; and has
the appearance
, at least in the opinion of younger brothers ,
of the greatest impartiality and justice .
But
when the
emperors
began
to
create
honorary
feuds ,
or
titles
of
nobility, it was found necessary (in order to preserve
their
dignity) to make
them
impartible
(b) , or (as they styled
them ) feuda individua , and in consequence
descendible
to
the eldest son alone .
This example was farther
enforced
by the inconveniences that attended the splitting of estates ;
namely , the division
of the military services, the multi-
tude of infant tenants incapable of performing
any duty ,
the consequential weakening of the strength of the king-
dom, and the inducing
younger sons to take up with
the
business
and idleness of a country life , instead of being
serviceable to themselves and the public , by engaging in
mercantile , in military, in civil , or in ecclesiastical em-
ployments (c).
These reasons occasioned an almost total
change in the method of feudal
inheritances
abroad ; so

ancestors, whether
male or female , and

(p) The words of the
act are (s.
9) " That any person related to the
person from whom
the
descent is

andtheplace in which any such rela-
tion by the half blood

degreeof the whole

shall be a male ; and next
after the
common

where
such
common ancestor shall be a female ;
so that the
brother
of the
half

father ,

after the
sisters

the father and their issue, and the
brother of the half blood , on the
part of the mother ,

The latter
part of the section can only be un-
derstood by reference to the
suc-
ceeding
rule that
male
ancestors
and their
issue
are
preferred
to
female ancestors , which
renders its
meaning sufficiently
plain .
For a
half brother the son of a common
father will take by virtue
of being
issue of the father
before the
suc-
cession
reaches
the
mother ,
but
after the brothers
and sisters of the
whole
blood
who
themselves
come
after the father , but a half brother ,
the son of a common
mother , does
not take till all male
paternal
an-
cestors and their issue are exhausted ,
and then the succession goes to the
mother
before him,
and
he
takes
next after her .

TITLE
BY DESCENT .
i
This
rule was settled by the legislature in accordance
with a previous decision of the courts (s ) which
followed
much prior discussion as to the true theory of descent
in
so remote
a
case
as the exhaustion
of all male paternal
ancestors , and their lineal descendants .
The effect of it is that the mother of the remotest male
paternal
ancestor shall
inherit
before the
mother of the
purchaser , and before the mother of any nearer paternal
ancestor .
It will
be observed
from this , that , unless
on
tracing the ascending line of male paternal ancestors ,
an
ancestor is reached who was filius nullius
or a bastard , it
can never be absolutely shown that a mother or any other
female
ancestor
is , as
such , the
heir .
For unless it be
assumed that
there is no descendant living from any one
of the persons
who
occupied
the
ascending
line
from
father to father up to the commencement of the world , no
female
ancestor
can
as
such inherit.
Yet , since
every
paternal ancestor must
have had a father , who must also
have had a father , and so on , it is incredible but that from
some one of these
successive persons
there
should
be
living descendants could they be discovered .
of inheriting until all his male
pa-
ternal
ancestors and their descend-
ants shall have failed
; and that no
female
maternal
ancestor
of
such
person , nor any of her descendants ,
shall be capable
of inheriting until
all his male maternal
ancestors and
their descendants shall have failed ."

there

  Although ,
therefore , the
father ,
and
after
him
the
brothers
and sisters and half brothers and sisters , children
of the father , are very near in the line of succession , yet it
is next to impossible that the mother
or half brothers
or
sisters children of the mother should ever inherit .
Whether , therefore , the
rules
of
inheritance
as
now
fixed
by law
are in all
respects
satisfactory , may
be
doubted .
Having regard to these rules of succession , and to the
fact , which the experience of most persons will illustrate ,
of the extreme difficulty
of tracing
the complete history
of a family through more than
two generations , we may
perceive how hard it is to ascertain with certainty who is
the heir of a given
person , except he had at the time of
his decease relations
nearly allied
to him by blood .
The accompanying
diagram
will
illustrate
the applica-
tion of the rules which have been enunciated .
Such a diagram
can of course only exhibit
the succes-
sion
in
accordance with
a particular
pedigree ;
it will
however suffice to exemplify
the rules which we have laid
down , by which
in any
case
when the members
of a
family are completely
known , the true
course of descent
may be determined .
We will suppose that the purchaser
has married twice ,
and has had a son and a daughter by each marriage ; and
we will
also
suppose,
in
order
to
introduce
all the
branches
of the
pedigree , that
the
ascending
lines
of
ancestors
terminate
at the fourth
generation .
First,
then, in the order of succession ,
stands
the
eldest
son
(No.
1) , or his issue , if he be dead . If his line be ex-
tinct , then his half-brother , the
second son of the pur-
chaser ,
succeeds .
We
may
here
notice that
had
the
eldest
son
been the
purchaser , then
this
step
in the
descent would have been different : for by the sixth
rule
the eldest daughter
being of the whole
blood with
the
eldest
son would
have succeeded
on her brother's
death
in priority to the half-brother . If both
sons and their


390
TITLE
BY DESCENT .
issue be exhausted , since the inheritance
descends
to the
heirs of the purchaser , the two daughters , though
related
to
each
other by the half-blood , together
succeed
as co-
parceners (No.
3) .
In default of these or their issue , the
descent must be traced from the purchaser , all of whose
lineal issue are now supposed to be exhausted .
The next heir therefore is , by the third rule, the father
(No. 4 ) , who is succeeded
in turn by (No.
5 ) and
(No.
6),
the elder and younger
brothers of the whole blood who ,
by virtue of the sixth rule , stand next in succession
, and
after them (No.
7) , the sisters , who take like the daugh-
ters as coparceners
.
If now all the brothers
and
sisters
of the whole
blood
and their issue
are exhausted , the
inheritance
next
passes
to (No.
9) , the
children of the
father related by the half blood to the purchaser .
These ,
by virtue of the second and sixth
rules , take in the order
prescribed by the fourth
and fifth rules .
We may here
again notice the effect of the sixth rule , which , as will
be
seen , modifies
or overrides in some respects other rules.
Though the descent is now being traced among the lineal
descendants of the
father , by virtue of the second rule ,
which
declares their right of representation
to him, yet
inasmuch
as the father is not the stock of descent, the
descent takes
a different
course to that which it would
have done had the father been the purchaser .
For the
sisters of the whole blood (No.
7) take in priority to the
half-brother
(No.
8) ,
whereas had the
father
been
the
purchaser , No. 8 would of course
by the fourth rule have
had priority over No. 7.
Upon the failure of all descendants
of the father , the inheritance
next
passes to (No. 10) the
grandfather , and through him to (No.
11 ) the uncles and
aunts of the whole blood , and after them to (No.
12 ) the
uncles and aunts of the half blood , the due order of per-
sons , members of these respective classes , being observed .
When all these and their respective
descendants
are
exhausted ,
the
next
person
in
order
of
succession
is
(No. 13) the great grandfather , after whom come
(No.
14 )


MALE DESCENT .
391
and (No.
15 ) the
other
issue of the great
grandfather
related
to the purchaser
by the whole
and half-blood
respectively
; and after them (No. 16) the paternal grand-
father's
grandfather
and
(No.
17) his
other issue .
All
the male paternal
ancestors and their issue are now sup-
posed to be exhausted .
In
seeking the next heir we are
by the seventh rule directed
to take the female
ancestor
who is the mother of the most remote paternal
ancestor
in preference
to any other , therefore
(No. 18) the paternal
grandfather's paternal grandmother is the next heir .
In defect of any of her descendants being in existence
the paternal grandfather's
mother (No.
19) and her issue
(No. 20 ) succeed , who are followed by her father
(No. 21 )
and his other issue (No. 22 ) in default of whom (No. 23)
the mother of No.
19 takes the inheritance .
Having now exhausted all the ancestors both male and
female of the
paternal grandfather
of the
purchaser , we
are next to seek the maternal
ancestors
of the father . The
paternal
grandmother
(No.
24 ) and
(No. 25) her issue ,
related
to the purchaser
by half
blood ,
therefore
next
succeed .
In default of whom the same succession of her
ancestors
is traced
as in the former
case of those of the
paternal
grandfather's
mother .
When all these are ex-
hausted we shall have traced the succession through every
branch
of the paternal half of the pedigree ;
and then ,
but not before, does
the mother
succeed , followed by her
children , the brothers and sisters of the half blood of the
purchaser .
In default of whom or any of their issue the
maternal pedigree is to be traced
in a like manner as was
previously done with the paternal
pedigree .
The diagram
indicates , by Roman
numerals , the order
of succession by the
common law, that is, according to
the rules in force prior to the year 1834.
It may be borne in mind that the order of succession
which we have described is the order in which
successive
persons take the actual possession and enjoyment of the
property so long as it devolves in an unbroken line of


392
TITLE
BY
DESCENT .
descent, that is, so long as there is no dealing by will or
conveyance of such
a character
as
to
constitute
a new
purchaser .
In the present day wills are so common that
it is rare to find many successive
descents, except perhaps
amongst
small
agricultural
owners , with whom it is not
altogether
uncommon
to find
several
successive
owners
dying intestate .
Before the year 1834, since the descent
was
traced
not from the last
purchaser
but
from
the
person last actually
seised
of the estate, a new order of
succession had
to be observed upon
the
death of every
person
in whom
the property
had vested, since
he by
his
own seisin became
the ancestor
or
stirpes
from whom
the
descent had
to
be
traced
.
On comparing
the two series
of
numbers
it
will
be
remarked that the most important
variations
arise from the former
exclusion
of
lineal an-
cestors
and of relations of the half blood
.


CHAPTER XV .
ESCHEAT .
In the preceding chapter we have seen that , according
to the present
use of the terms , title by descent is set in
opposition to and distinguished
from title by purchase .
But the law also takes notice of other modes of acquiring
dominion over land , and therefore in a sense acquiring
or
completing
a title ; these are, as we have
seen , escheat ,
partition , and inclosure .
As to
partitions ,

ESCHEAT .
Escheat.
Requisites
to a com-
plete title
by escheat.
Escheat , we may remember (a) , was one of the fruits
and consequences
of feudal tenure .
The word itself is
originally French or Norman (b) , in which
language
it
signifies
chance or accident ; and with us it
denotes
an
obstruction
of the
course of descent,
and
a
consequent
determination
of the tenure , by some unforeseen
contin-
gency
in which case the land
naturally
results back , by
a kind of reversion , to the original
grantor
or lord of the
fee (c).
But it must be remembered
that , in order to complete
this title by escheat , it is necessary that the lord perform
an act of his own , by entering on the lands and tenements
so
escheated , or bringing
an
action of ejectment , which
action has been substituted
for the old writ of escheat , a
writ which the
legislature
has abolished (d) .
Except ,
indeed , when the seignory is in the crown , in which
case
there first issues a commission
of escheat, and
office
is
found
thereby (e) .
If, however , any act is done which
amounts to an implied
waiver of the lord's right , as the
acceptance of homage , or rent of a stranger
who
usurps
the possession, the title by escheat
is barred (f).
The
estate in the seignory carries with it as an
accessory
or
part of it, the right to the
lands
on their
escheat , so
much so, indeed, that an incumbrance
upon the seignory
will bind the lands which accrue
to the lord by escheat (9),
and the inheritance of the escheated
lands will be iden-
tical with
that
of the seignory (h) .
Nevertheless , inas-
much
as the lands
may , without
impropriety , be said to
be acquired by the lord by reason of the escheat, the law

TITLE
BY
ESCHEAT .
395
E
concerning
escheats
may with
advantage
be here con-
sidered
before entering
upon the second
branch of title ,
that by purchase .
The law of escheats
is founded upon a simple principle ,
which
those
who
have
completely
comprehended
the
system of tenure , which was introduced in the feudal ages ,
will readily
understand .
All inheritances
are supposed
to be the result of a grant by
a lord .
Originally this
grant was to the tenant , and after him to his heirs , who
were so far entitled
to the benefit of the grant that they
could not
be deprived of it by any act of their ancestor.
Such
a grant necessarily
reserved to the lord the full
dominion over the land if there should be no heirs (2) , for
whenever
such a failure took place , there was no person to
take under the grant , which therefore ceased
to have any
operative
effect.
This theory of grants was considerably
broken into by the introduction of the power of alienation ,
whereby the heirs of the original
grantee could be deprived
of their
hopes of succession in favour
of those of the
alienee .
Nevertheless , this did not affect the right of
the lord to an escheat
further than this , that the defect of
heirs upon which
the
escheat
took place was that of the
heirs of the last tenant instead of the heirs of the original
grantee .
An escheat
therefore takes place when upon
the death
of a tenant in fee -simple there is no person who can claim
title to the land
either by descent or devise .
This is
usually
described as being
a defect of heirs
or defectum
sanguinis .
But
besides this
case
of defectum
sanguinis ,
since a
grant is supposed to continue in force only so long as the
tenant does not by his conduct prove himself incapable of
rendering the services due to the
lord ;
therefore , upon
attainder of the tenant , he ceases to be capable of holding
his lands .
And to this
personal
incapacity
there
was
(i) Revertitur
terra ,
as Bracton
says in describing
an
escheat, lib. 2,
fo. 23.


396
ESCHEAT .
added by the feudal
doctrines an incapacity
to transmit
any title, or the blood was said to be corrupted (k).
Thus
the
circumstances
of an attainder
were
assimilated
to
those of a death without heirs on the part of the tenant ,
and the lands
escheated
to
the
lord.
The
inheritable
quality was expunged in one instance , and expired in the
other ,
or,
as
the
doctrine
of
escheats
is expressed in
Fleta (1), "dominus capitalis feodi loco
hæredis
habetur ,
quoties
per
defectum
vel
delictum
extinguitur
sanguis
tenentis ."
The law of escheat
is not permitted
to create an injus-
tice towards
those who have acquired
any right in
the
lands .
Therefore
any partial
estate ,
as for years
or for
life, which may have been validly created
by any tenant ,
will hold good against the lord after the escheat .
Again,
a will duly executed by the last tenant in fee , as it would
have defeated both
his
heir
and the heir of the pur-
chaser, had there been any , will also defeat the lord's title.
by escheat .
Moreover , the
lands will be
assets
in the
hands of the lord for payment
of the debts of the last
tenant (m), to be administered in chancery .
And an in-
cumbrance which has been created
by the tenant will have
effect given
to it against
the lord (n).
The
legislature
a trusteedo has also
protected lands vested in a trustee from escheat
through
failure of heirs or attainder of the trustee (0).
Lands

We must
take
care to distinguish
escheat from for-
feiture to the
crown , which
takes place , as we shall
see
presently , under
some
circumstances
closely
resembling
those of escheat .
In order satisfactorily
to illustrate
the
doctrine of escheat , we will consider in
order the several
cases in which it now takes place .

TITLE
BY
ESCHEAT .
397
The
first
case ,
which
is
where
inheritable
blood is
wanting
upon
the
death of a tenant , may be collected
from the rules of descent laid down and explained
in the
preceding
chapter ,
from
which
it is
apparent
that
an
escheat
takes place where there is neither
an heir to the
last purchaser of the lands nor to the person last entitled .
This
combination
of wants
can
rarely
happen
except
where the purchaser
is himself the person last entitled ,
and dies without
an heir .
We may notice , however , that
the law has not
provided
for the
case
( a possible
one ,
though so improbable
that it hardly can be believed it
will ever happen (p ) ) , of both the purchaser's heirs failing ,
as also those of the person last entitled , and yet there
being heirs of a person who had enjoyed the property by
descent from
the purchaser
and prior to the person last
entitled .
A few particular
instances of defect of heirs
may
be
here adduced , rather in exemplification
of those doctrines
which we have already stated than in addition
thereto .
A monster , not having the shape of mankind , but in any
part evidently
bearing the resemblance of the brute crea-
tion, has no inheritable
blood , and cannot be heir to any
land, even though it be brought
forth in marriage : but,
although it hath deformity in any part of its body , yet , if
it has
human
shape , it may be
heir (q).
This is a very
ancient
rule in the law of England (r) ; and its reason is
(p) The case might
happen where
the purchaser
was the only child of
a bastard father and bastard mother ;
his
father
married
as
a
second
wife a legitimate
person , by whom
he had
a son A.; and
afterwards
married a third wife , a bastard , by
whom
he
had
a
son
B.
After
the
purchaser's
death ,
the
order
of succession
would
be,
1st , the
father ; 2nd,
A.
(who
enters
and
dies
without
issue) ;
3rd , B.;
on
B.'s
death
without
issue
there
would
be the failure of heirs requi-
site for an
escheat, yet
A.'s
heirs
through
his
mother
might
be in
existence .

too obvious , and too shocking , to bear a minute
discus-
sion, which, moreover , is
unnecessary, since such lusus
naturæ can rarely
occur.
The
Roman
law agrees
with
our own in excluding
such births from successions (s),
yet accounts them , however , children
in some respects ,
where the parents , or at least the father , could reap any
advantage
thereby (t) ; (as the jus trium liberorum, and
the like) ;
esteeming them the misfortune , rather
than
the fault, of that parent.
But our law will not admit
a
birth of this kind to be such an issue, as shall
entitle
the
husband to be tenant by the curtesy (u) ; because it is not
capable of inheriting .
And
therefore , if there appears
no
other heir than
such a prodigious
birth, the land
shall
escheat to the lord .
Bastards
are incapable
of being
heirs .
Bastards , by
our law , are such children
as are not born either in lawful
wedlock , or within a competent
time
after its determina-
tion .
Such are held to be nulliusfilii, the sons of nobody ;
for the maxim of law is, qui ex damnato coitu nascuntur,
inter liberos non computantur (x).
Being thus the sons of
nobody , they have no blood in them , at least no inheritable
blood ; consequently , none of the blood of the first pur-
chaser
and therefore , if there be no other claimant
than
such illegitimate
children , the land
shall
escheat
to the
lord (3).
The civil law differs from ours in this point , and
allows
a bastard to succeed
to an inheritance , if after its
birth the mother was married
to the
father , which
rule
has been adopted in Scotland ,
France , and other coun-
talis inter
liberos
connumerabitur
.

and also , if the father
had no lawful wife
or
child , then, even if the concubine was never married
to
the father , yet
she and her
bastard
son were admitted
each to one-twelfth of the inheritance (a) : and a bastard
was
likewise
capable of succeeding to the
whole of his
mother's
estate ,
although
she
was
never
married : the
mother being
sufficiently
certain , though
the
father
is
not (6) .
But our law, in favour of marriage , is much less
indulgent
to bastards , and will not recognise the status of

the
purpose of inheriting

There
was , indeed , formerly
one instance , in which our Caseof bas-
law
has
shown
them
some little regard ;
and
that is and mulier
usually termed the case of bastard eigne and mulier puisnè .
This happened
when a man
has a bastard
son , and after-
wards marries
the
mother , and by her has a legitimate
son , who , in the
language of the law, is called a mulier ,
or as Glanvil (d ) expresses
it in his Latin filius mulier-
atus ; the
woman
before marriage
being
concubina , and
afterwards mulier .
Now here the eldest son is bastard , or
bastard
eignè ;
and
the
younger
son is legitimate ,
or
mulier puisnè . If then the father
died , and the bastard
eigné entered
upon
his
land , and enjoyed it to his death,
and died seised
thereof
so that the inheritance
descended
to his issue ; in this
case the mulier puisnè and all other

capacity whatsoever) , were totally barred of their right (d).
But this
indulgence
was
shown to no
other kind
of
bastard ;
for , if the mother
was never married to the
father ,
such
bastard
could
have no
colourable
title
at
all (e).
Since
the
changes in the law of
inheritance ,
which now gives title to each
successor
as heir of the pur-
chaser
upon
every
death of
a tenant ,
and
since
the
statute (f) which
enacted
that
no
descent
cast
should
defeat any
right of entry , this
privilege
of the bastard
eignè has ceased to exist .
As bastards cannot be heirs themselves , so neither can
they have any heirs but those of their own bodies.
For,
as all collateral kindred consists in being derived from the
same
common
ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal
ancestors, he can have no collateral
kindred ; and conse-
quently , can have
no legal heirs , but such as claim by a
lineal descent
from himself.
And therefore , if a bastard
purchases land , and dies seised
thereof without
issue, and
intestate , the land shall
escheat
to the lord of the
fee.
Though , as
we
shall
hereafter
see , it is different if the
lands be vested in a trustee (g).
Aliens , also ,
are
incapable
of
taking
by
descent ,
or
inheriting
for they are not allowed
to have any inherit-
able blood in them .
The law prohibiting
aliens from holding
land
is a rule
stricti juris, though somewhat
relaxed of late , for it was
formerly
more
stringent
than
it
now is . If an alien
purchased
any
estate , unless with the king's licence (h) ,
the lands were at
once
forfeited
to the crown , and upon
inquisition and office found , the crown might take posses-
sion (¿).
It will be noticed that this was not an escheat

ALIENATION BY DEED
ALIENS .
401
to any lord , but a paramount right of the crown , founded ,
as Spelman says , upon the inconsistency of the
tenure of
lands
by fealty
with allegiance
to a foreign
prince (j) ;
or if not resting upon the mere technical grounds of in-
consistent
oaths , it depends upon
analogous
principles
that the observance of political
duties (k) , if antagonistic
in nature , cannot be required from the same persons.
Upon similar principles , then , if the only person who
can be a man's
heir is an alien , there is no one who can
take the lands by descent on the death of such
a tenant ,
therefore the lands escheat
to the lord .
They are not for-
feited , because they never were acquired by the alien .
Formerly , also , the doctrine
of an alien possessing no
inheritable

Oliver the younger be a natural -born subject , upon John's
death without
issue his lands will descend
to Oliver
the
younger brother :
now , if afterwards Francis has a child
born in England , it was feared that , under the statute of
king William , this new-born child might defeat the estate
of his uncle Oliver.
Wherefore it is provided by a later
statute (m), that no right of inheritance
shall accrue by
virtue
of the
former
statute to any
person
whatsoever
,
unless
they
are in being
and capable to take as heirs at
the
death of the person last seised
:—with an exception ,
however, in the case
where
lands
shall
descend to the
daughter
of an alien ; which descent shall be divested
in
favour of an after -born
brother , or the inheritance
shall
be divided with
an after -born
sister or sisters , according
to the usual rule of descents by the common law.
Again , by another
act, a man
whose
mother
was
a
natural born subject is , even though he be born out of the
English
dominion
of an alien

tenant of lands for treason or other felony ;
and here we
must again
carefully
distinguish
between forfeiture
and
escheat .
Forfeiture of lands ,
and of whatever
else
the
offender
possessed
, was the
doctrine
of the
old
Saxon
law (q), as a part of
punishment
for the
offence ;
and
does not at all relate to the feudal
system, nor is it the
consequence of any seignory
or lordship paramount (r) :
but, being a prerogative vested
in the crown , was neither
superseded
nor
diminished
by the
introduction
of
the
Norman tenures ;
a fruit and
consequence
of which , es-
cheat must
undoubtedly
be reckoned .
Escheat
therefore
operates in subordination
to this more ancient and supe-
rior law of forfeiture , which
is that
upon
attainder for
treason the freehold
lands
held in fee simple or fee tail
are forfeited
absolutely and for ever : in the
case of any
other felony , for the term of the felon's life , or a year and
a day , which
ever is the longer
period (s).
We may re-
mark, however , that copyhold lands were never held to be
forfeited to the crown even for high treason
(t) .
The doctrine of escheat upon
attainder , taken
singly,
was , prior to the recent alterations in the law, this : that
the blood of the tenant , by the commission of any felony ,
(under
which
denomination
all
treasons were formerly
comprised (u) ) , was held to be corrupted and stained , and
the original
donation of the feud thereby determined , it
being always
granted
to the vassal on the implied

But under
rapacious
kings , such as the
Norman
line in
England , absolute forfeitures
came
to prevail , and a new doctrine
was
introduced ,
the
corruption
of
blood , by which the heir was ef-
fectually
excluded
from
deducing
his title at any distant time through
an
attainted
ancestor ."

Upon the thorough
de-
monstration
of
which guilt
,
by legal
attainder
(x),
the
feudal covenant and mutual bond
of
fealty are held
to
be
broken
,
the estate
instantly falls back from the offender
to
the lord of the fee
,
and the
inheritable
quality
of
his
blood
is
extinguished
and blotted out for ever
.
This law
of
feudal
escheat
was adopted
in
England after the
con-
quest
;
and
in
general
superadded
to
the ancient law
of
forfeiture
.
And
as
the consequence
of
this
corruption
and extinction
of
hereditary
blood
,
the land
of
all
felons
would
immediately
revest
in
the lord
,
but
that the supe-
rior law
of
forfeiture
intervenes
,
and
intercepts
it
in
its
passage for such periods
as
we have mentioned
;
subject
to
which
it
goes
to
the lord
in
a
regular
course
of
es-
cheat
(y
),
as
it
would have done
to
the heir
of
the felon
in
case the feudal
tenures had never been introduced
.
And
that this
is
the true
operation
and
genuine
history
of
escheats will most evidently appear from this
incident
to
gavelkind
lands
(
which
seems
to
be
the
old
Saxon
tenure
),
that they are
in
no
case
subject
to
escheat
for
felony
,
though they are liable
to
forfeiture
for treason
(2).
As
a
consequence
of
this
doctrine
of
escheat
,
all
lands
of inheritance
immediately
revesting
in
the lord
,
the wife
of the felon was liable
to

CORRUPTION
OF
BLOOD .
405
In addition to this forfeiture
and
escheat
of the lands
vested in the
offender at the time of the
commission of
his
crime
,
the
ancient
law superadded
a
further
rule
,
deduced
from the
same doctrine
of
corruption
of blood
,
which
,
though
not
affecting
the rights
of
the
crown by
forfeiture
,
was
most
important
in
connection
with
es-
cheats
.
For the ancient Norman
lawyers
held
that since
the blood
of
the offender was corrupted
no
person
could
claim any inheritance
through him
.
Thus
if
a
father was
seised
in
fee
,
and the eldest son committed
a
felony and
was attainted
,
and the father
died
,
living the offender
,
neither the latter
or
any other person could
claim
;
nor
if
the son died
in
the lifetime
of
his
father
,
leaving
issue
,
could the grandson claim
as
heir
.
In
such cases the lands
escheated
(b)
for the son could
not
inherit
,
and during
his
life
no
other person could
be
heir
,
and
in
the second
case the grandson
could
not inherit since his
claim was
extinguished
by the corruption
of
blood
.
This extension
of
the doctrine was
a
refinement
upon the ancient law
of
feuds
,
which
allowed
that the
grandson might
be
heir
to
his
grandfather
,
though
the
son
in
the
intermediate
generation was guilty
of
felony
(c).
Such was the law
of
England
,
which prevailed from the
period of the full
establishment
of
feudal
laws until
recently
,
although
the
harshness
which
such
rigorous
rules
often
occasioned
to
innocent
individuals
,
has been
so
far recognised for the last three centuries
,
that
in
most
(if
not all
)
of
the new felonies created by parliament
since
the
reign
of
Henry VIII
.,
it
was declared
,
that they
should
not
extend
to
any
corruption
of
blood
:
and by
the statute

21
,
(
the operation
of
which
was

by the

his sons , no attainder
for
treason
should
extend to the
disinheriting
any heirs , nor the prejudice of any
person ,
other than the offender himself.
These last provisions ,
indeed ,
were repealed
by
a
later
act (d) , but a general
remedy for the hardship
which was felt in these
cases
has
been provided
by
an
act
passed
early in the
present
century (e), by which it is enacted
that
no attainder
for
felony , except high treason , petit treason (since abolished ),
or murder , shall extend " to the disinheriting
of any heir ,
or to the prejudice of the right or title of any person
or
persons , other
than the right
or title of the offender or
offenders during his , her , or their natural
lives
only , so
that it shall be lawful to every person or persons to whom
the right or interest of any lands , tenements , or heredi-
taments after the
death of any such offender or offenders
should
or might have appertained , if no such
attainder
had
been to enter into the same " (f).
Formerly , if the
legal
estate , which was vested in a trustee ,
escheated
, or
was forfeited , the
lord
or the
crown took the lands dis-
charged of the trust (g) , this law, which , in modern times
at least , was an obvious injustice , has we have
seen
been
remedied by statute (h).
We may notice
that by the
ancient
rules of law , the
descent from one brother
to another was considered
im-
mediate () ,
and not through the
father ;
therefore the
attainder of a common
ancestor
was no
bar to heirship
between brothers , and it seems
to have been
immaterial

for
treason
on a
title
or
dignity ,

It would
seem that
a will made
before the
commission
of
the
offence
would
pass the lands , so that on the death
of the offender the devisee would
be
( ) itled, where
the attainder is for
other
than
the

offences .

So between cousins , the attainder of their

could
not affect the claim of one to

which
was held
in these cases
to
be decisive in favour of the claim , viz . ,
that the heirship

the relationship

have the effect of creating

CHAPTER XVI .
TITLE
BY
PURCHASE ,
AND
FIRST BY OCCUPANCY .
WE come now to
consider , the several modes of ac-
quiring title included in the second division of the subject ,
all
of which
come
under the
general
denomination
of
purchase.
Purchase , perquisitio , taken in
its
largest and most ex-
tensive sense
,
is
thus defined by Littleton
(a):
the posses-
sion
of
lands
and tenements
,
which
a
man has
,
by his
own act
or
agreement
,
and not by descent from any of
his
ancestors
or kindred
.
In this
sense
it
is
contra-
distinguished
from acquisition by right
of
blood
,
and in-
cludes
every
other method
of
coming
to
an
estate
,
but
merely that by inheritance
:
wherein the title
is
vested
in
a
person not
by
his own act
or
agreement
,
but by the single
operation
of
law
(b).
"
Conquest
"
What we call
purchase
,
perquisitio
,
the feudists
called
conquest
,
conquaestus
,
or
conquisitio
(c):
both denoting
any means of acquiring
an estate
out of the
common
course
of
inheritance
.
And this
is
still the proper phrase
in
the law
of
Scotland
(d)
:
as
it
was among the Norman
jurists
,
who
styled
the first purchaser
(
that
is
,
he
who
brought the
estate into the family which
at
present owns
it)
the conqueror
or
conquereur
(e).

signifying
that he was the first of his family who ac-

crown of England , and from whom
therefore
all future
claims
by descent must
be derived
: though
now, from
our
disuse of the feudal
sense
of the word ,
together with the
reflection on his forcible method of ac-
quisition , we are apt to annex the idea of victory to this
name of conquest or conquisition : a title which , however
just with regard to the crown , the conqueror
never pre-

tate by his own

A
man who has his father's
estates
settled upon
him
in

,
before
he
was born
,
is
also
a
purchaser
;
for
he
takes quite
another
estate

the law
of
descents
would have given
him
.

TITLE
BY PURCHASE ,
AND
FIRST BY
OCCUPANCY .
If in the limitations of a deed , an estate (preceded by
other partial interests ) be given to the heir of A. , a living
person , A. takes no estate , but if he dies during the con-
tinuance of the
preceding
estate , his heir takes as a pur-
chaser , being , in fact , persona
designata ;
but
this
re-
mainder
is
of
course
contingent because
,
if
A.
be still alive
when
the
prior
estates
determine
,
there
is
no
persona
designata
,
to
take the remainder
.
In such
a
case the heir
who takes the land
is
a
purchaser
in
all respects
,
except
that the
subsequent devolution
by descent will
be
regu-
lated
as
if
A.
had been the purchaser
(k).
We have already discussed the rule
of
construction
(1)
by which
if
an estate

limited
to
the heirs of
A.
by
an
assurance under
which he already
has taken an estate
for
life
,
the heir
,
if
he ever takes the estate
at
all
,
takes
it
by
descent from
A.
,
and not by
purchase
,

the
word
"
heirs
"
so
used merely
has the effect
of
enlarging
the
previously
created
estate for life into an absolute dispos-
able fee simple
.
This rule
arose
from the consideration
that
,
had
it
been otherwise
,
had the heir
(
who
is
uncertain
till the death of the ancestor
)
been allowed
to
take
as
a
purchaser originally nominated
in
the deed
,
as
must have
been the case
if
the remainder had been expressly limited
to
Matthew
or
Thomas by name
;
then
,
in
the times
of
strict
feudal
tenure
,
the lord would
have been
defrauded
by such
a
limitation
of
the fruits
of
his seignory

arise
in
those times
when
alienation
was
not
practised.
The importance of the distinction
between the acquisi-
tion of an
estate
by purchase and by descent principally
consists in this :-that the
future
devolution
upon in-
testacy of the tenant is governed by different
rules .
this we have said enough .
Of
There is also occasionally an importance in reference to
the liability of an
estate , to the engagements of those of
whom
the owner is heir ; for
in the
case we have sug-
gested , of a gift to A.'s heir , when A. takes no estate
and
therefore
the
heir takes by purchase , although
the estate
will afterwards
descend
as if A.
had been the purchaser ,
it will not be liable in the hands of successive owners , for
A.'s engagements (m) .
This is the legal signification
of the word perquisitio
or
purchase ,
and in
this
sense it
includes
the
following
methods
of acquiring
titles to estates
:
1.
Occupancy ;
2 .
Prescription
(to which may
be
added
the title
acquired
under the
Statutes
of limitations ) ;
3.
Forfeiture
;
4 .
Alienation .
Of all these in their order.
Occupancy
is the taking possession
of those things ,
which before belonged to nobody .
We have already dis-
cussed its connection with the foundation
of property , or
of holding those things in severalty , which , by the law of
nature, unqualified
by that of society, were common to
all mankind .
But , when
once it is agreed
that
every
thing
capable of ownership shall have an owner , natural
reason suggests that he who first declares his intention of

appropriating
anything
to his
own
use , and , in conse-
quence of such intention , actually
takes it into
possession
and adopts
a course of action grounded
upon
that fact ,
shall thereby gain
the absolute property of it ; according
to that rule of the law of nations , recognised
by the laws
of Rome (n), quod nullius
est, id ratione naturali occupanti
conceditur.
This right of occupancy , so far as it concerns real pro-
perty (and of this
only we are now treating , the title
to
personal chattels being reserved for a later place) , has but
little application
in
English
law .
The
only
instance,
in fact , in which it ever has
been
admitted
was that
which we noticed in discussing
the nature of an estate pur
autre vie, and,
as we there
saw, the general doctrine of
occupancy by which
persons
wholly strangers
to the
pro-
perty acquired title has ceased
to exist .
And the persons
who
still
acquire title
as
special occupants
are , in fact ,
those very
persons
who , according
to rules
of descent
applicable to other cases , would also acquire title.
There are some cases , where the laws of other nations
give a right by occupancy , as in lands newly
created , by
the rising of an island
in the sea or in a river , or by the
alluvion
or
dereliction
of the waters ;
but in these in-
stances the law of England assigns them an immediate
owner .
Bracton
tells
us (o), that if an island
arise in
the middle of a river , it belongs in common to those who
have lands
on
each
side thereof ; but if it be nearer to
one bank
than
the other , it belongs only to him who is
proprietor
of the
nearest
shore.

NEW
LANDS
FORMING
IN
THE
SEA .
413
statement
hardly represents the
exact rule in this
case ,
for it is now well settled (p) that the soil
or alveus of
non-navigable
rivers is not the common property of the
riparian proprietors , but
each
is
entitled
in severalty ad
medium filum aquæ ( q) , and this right of property which ,
whilst the land
continues
covered
with the water is sub-
ject to the rights of water belonging
to other riparian
pro-
prietors , becomes an absolute right when the
stream is
from any cause permanently
diverted .
Therefore it would
seem that the island
mentioned
by Bracton
as rising in
the middle of the
stream would belong not to the riparian
owners in common , but a part of it to
each of them in
severalty , the shares being
separated by the line which
previously
was the middle
line of the water .
Bracton's
statement was copied from the civil law, which apparently
did not adopt the principle
of several
private
property in
the soil of the river (r).
If the course of the river be changed
by a sudden and
violent
flood or other similar means , so that a riparian
owner loses suddenly his land , it would seem that though
his land has become
part of the alveus , yet he has not
lost his right of recovering it by any works which he may
erect to keep
out the river , whatever
may be the con-
sequences of such works to the opposite owner (s) .

The rule as to islands
in a
river
referred
to above (Inst . 2, 1,
22) immediately
follows
the
rule
that islands
rising in the sea be-
come the property
of the first occu-
pant,
and
the
proprietary
given
seemsto be that of a special
occu-
pant.
(s) Having
regard
to
the
now
established
doctrines
as to
the
ownership
of the
alveus
in
non-
navigable
rivers
and
the rights
incident
to
such
ownership , it
is
conceived
that this
would
be the
law ; as to these rivers , there
is
a
case cited
in
Callis ,
51, from
the
22 Lib. Ass . pl. 93, which seems to
bear out the views
expressed in the
text.
" The case was, that a river
of water did run between two lord-
ships ,
and
the
soil
of
one
side,
together
with the river
of water ,
did wholly
belong
to
one of the


414
TITLE
BY
PURCHASE ,
AND
FIRST BY
OCCUPANCY .
The
channels
of
navigable
rivers
are ,
as
has
been
already
remarked
(t),
public
highways , and
the soil is
presumably in the
crown (u).
In
such
cases
the
same
principles
apply to give the crown the relicted land .
So, also , when the alveus or soil of the river belongs
to
a subject
not a riparian
owner ,
as
sometimes
happens
where a several fishery is claimed
(x) , any eyott
or little
island
which
may be formed in the
river
becomes
the
property of him to whom the alveus belongs .
However ,
in case a new island rise in the sea , though the civil
law
gives it to the first occupant (y) , yet ours gives it to the
king ( ) ; and, we may add , that when a new country is
thus
acquired
by occupancy ,
the
laws
of England
as
existing
at the period of such occupancy
accrue
to the
new acquisition (a).
And
as to lands gained
from
the
sea , either by alluvion , by the washing
up of
sand
and
earth , so as in time to make terra firma ; or by dereliction ,
as when the
sea
shrinks
back
below the usual
water-
mark ; in these
cases
the law is held to
be , that if this
gain be by little
and little , by small and imperceptible
said
lordships ,
and the river by
little and little did gather upon the
soil of the other lord , but so slowly ,
that if one had fixed his eye a whole
day
thereon
together , it could not
be
perceived .
By this petty
and
imperceptible
increase , the increase-
ment was got
to the
owner of the
river, but if the river by a sudden
and unusual flood had gained hastily
a great
parcel
of
the
other
lord's
ground , he should not thereby have
lost the same ; and so of petty and
unperceivable
increasements
from
the sea,the king gains no property ,

degrees , it shall go to the owner of the land adjoining
(6) .
For de minimis non curat lex : and,
besides , these owners
being often
losers by the
breaking
in of the sea , or at
charges to keep it out , this possible gain is therefore a
reciprocal consideration
for such possible
charge or loss .
But , if the alluvion
or dereliction
be
sudden and consi-
derable , in this
case it belongs
to the king ; for , as the
king
is lord of the sea , and
so owner of the soil while it
is covered with water , it is but reasonable he should
have
the soil , when the water
has left it dry (c) .
So that the
quantity of ground gained , and the time during
which it
is gaining , seem to determine whether it is the king's or
the subject's
property .
In the same manner , if a river ,
running
between two lordships , by degrees
gains
upon
the one , and thereby leaves the other dry , the owner who
loses his ground thus imperceptibly
has no remedy (d).

case involving the
principles
here treated of is now depending in
the courts , concerning
the manor of
Lancing, in Sussex . The river Adur
formerly

at right angles to

of the tides began to throw a bank
of
shingle
across its
mouth ,
and
along the shore
to the
east.

effect of this

been that the
river, instead
of entering
the
sea,
has turned
towards

flowed parallel to the shore, having a
bank of land between it and the sea,

rivers , is nearly the same in the imperial law (e) ; from
whence indeed
some
at least of our determinations
seem
to have
been adopted : but we
ourselves ,
as
islanders ,
have applied them to marine increments ; and we have in
this
as
in many other instances given
our
sovereign
the
prerogative
he
enjoys

as
well upon
the
ground
of
his

lordship
as
also
upon

The
question
to
be
determined
is to
whom the bank
belongs
,
whether
to
the lord
of
the
manor
of
Lancing
,
which
manor
abuts on the river on the west side
,
or to the owners of the land
on the
east side of the
river
,
opposite
to
the accretion
.
The first impression
of the
court
seems to have been in
favour of the former
.

CHAPTER XVII.
TITLE
BY
PRESCRIPTION
,
AND
UNDER
THE
STATUTE
OF
LIMITATIONS .
A
SECOND
method of acquiring
real
property by pur-
chase is that by prescription
;
as when
a man
can show
no other title to what he claims , than that he, and those
under whom he claims , have long used to enjoy it.
Con-
cerning customs , or immemorial
usages , in general , with
the several requisites and rules to be observed
, in order to
prove their
existence and validity , we inquired
at
some
length in the preceding part of these Commentaries (a).
At present , therefore , we will merely distinguish
between
custom , strictly
taken , and prescription
; and then
show
what sort of things may be prescribed for, and how the
claim may be established .
between

ticular property , such
as a custom in the manor of Dale
that lands
shall
descend to the youngest son : prescription ,
on the other hand , is a strictly personal right ;
as , that
A. and his ancestors
, or those whose estate he hath , have
used time
out of mind to have such
an advantage
or
privilege
( b).
As for example , if there be a usage in the
parish of Dale , that all the inhabitants
of that parish may
run horse
races on Ascension
Day , or dance , on a certain
close within the parish (c) , at all times for their recreation ,

or draw water from a well in a private person's grounds , or
erect booths
on fair day (which
have
been
held to be
lawful
customs (d) ) , these
are
strictly
customs , for
they
are applied to the place in general , and not to any parti-
cular persons , or annexed to the possession of any parti-
cular houses in the place.
But if the tenant who is seised
of the manor of Dale in fee , alleges that he and his an-
cestors ,
or
all
those
whose
estate
he
has in the
said
manor , have used time out of mind
to have common of
pasture in such a close, this is properly
called a prescrip-
tion ; for this
is a usage annexed to the person of the
owner of this estate .
We may
observe
that
a custom
cannot
confer a right
to take a profit à prendre
from
a man's
land .
There-
fore
a custom for all the inhabitants
of a parish
to fish
in a man's
pool
and carry
away the fish is bad (e) ,
as
also is
an alleged
custom
to carry off the sand blown
from
the
sea
shore
upon
a
man's
close (ƒ) .
Such
claims
as
these
cannot
be made in favour of a whole
parish , or all the inhabitants
of a district, but if made
at all must
be made in favour of the owner of a par-
ticular
property ,
or
the
heir
and
representatives
of
a
particular
person , and then they depend upon prescription
or grant, and not custom .
We must also distinguish
here
parish
the
custom is bad , particu-
larly if it be unrestricted
as to the
duration
of the user .

DISTINCTION
BETWEEN CUSTOM
AND
PRESCRIPTION
.
those
customs which regulate the
rights of tenants of
a
manor ; for a claim by copyholders to dig clay or coal out
of their copyhold tenements , may be established as holding
good throughout
the
manor (g).
This is
evidently
a
custom of a kind different from that which gives a bene-
ficial right to inhabitants
generally .
Such
a custom
is
in fact merely evidence of the nature of the copyholder's
interest ( ), under
the grant from the lord , and is in fact
a species of general prescription in favour of all the tenants.
by virtue of their copyhold
estates (?).
Every prescription , then , must
be either in a man and
his
ancestors
,
or
other predecessors
in
title
(j
),
or
,
as
the
case may be
,
in

observe , that nothing but incorporeal hereditaments can be
claimed by prescription
: as a right of way , a common , &c. ;
but that no prescription can give a title to lands , and other
corporeal substances , of which more certain evidence
may
be had ( ).
For a man shall not be said to prescribe , that
he and his ancestors have immemorially
used
to hold
the
No prescrip- castle of Arundel : for this is clearly another sort of title ;
a title by corporal
seisin and inheritance , which is
more
permanent , and
therefore
more
capable
of proof ,
than
that of prescription .
It has been decided that no claim
or apeerage to sit in parliament
for a barony can now exist as annexed
to a castle. to the tenure of a castle and lands (1) .
But , as to a right
of way , a common , light and air , or the like , a man may be
allowed to prescribe ; for of these there is no corporal seisin,
the enjoyment will be frequently by intervals , and therefore
the right to enjoy them can depend on nothing
else but an
express grant ,
or such
usage as the law recognises
as
creating
a right .
We have in a former chapter ( m ) dis-
cussed at sufficient
length
the nature of easements
and
those incorporeal hereditaments which may be claimed by
prescription .
No
prescriptive
right in the nature of an
easement
so large
as
to preclude
the ordinary
uses of
property by the owner of the lands affected will be recog-
nised by law (n) .
A claim
may be made by prescription
to the exclusive
use of a chancel
or aisle , or a pew in an
aisle , or even
in the nave of a church
; in such a case it
must be shown that the claimant , and those whose estate
he has, have always repaired it (0) .

prescription
,
a
distinction
must be made with regard
to
the manner
of
prescribing
;
that
is
,
whether
a
man shall
prescribe
in
a
que
estate
,
or
in
himself and his
ancestors
.
For
,
if
a
man prescribes
in
a
que estate
,
(
that
is
,
in
himself
and those whose estate
in
certain lands he has
),
nothing
is
claimable by this
prescription
,
but such things
as
are
incident
,
appendant
,
or
appurtenant
to
lands
;
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
claim any thing
as
the
consequence
,
or
ap-
pendix of an estate
,
with which the thing claimed has no
connexion
(p
);
but
if
he prescribes
in
himself and his
ancestors
,
he may prescribe
for anything
whatsoever that
lies
in
grant
;
not only things
that
are
appurtenant
,
but
also such
as
may
be
in
gross
.
A
difficulty evidently
exists
in
prescribing
for
a
right
in
gross
,
such
as
to
take
the herbage
of
a
particular
field
,
where the claimant cannot
pretend that his own lineal
ancestors
have always enjoyed
the right
,
and that
it
has
descended
from generation
to
generation
.
Such
a
right may be granted
,
however
,
and
may
be
prescribed for
,
the prescription
being
in
the name
of
the grantor
(
from whom the claimant
deduces
his title
)
and his
ancestors
(q).
A

be sustainable by grant can be sustained by prescription (8).
And although
the claim is now in most
cases
supported
not by the
presumption
of a grant, but by virtue
of
statutory
enactment , yet no extension of prescription
to
cases not formerly
admitted
has ever been made.
Thus ,
the lord of a manor cannot
prescribe to raise a tax or toll
upon strangers ; for , as such claim could never have been
good by any grant, it cannot be good by prescription
(†) .
Again , that which
arises by matter of record
cannot
be
prescribed
for .
Therefore , there
can be no prescription
for the royal franchise of felon's goods and the like .
It
is
difficult
to
see
any
good
reason for the
last
rule ,
which , however , would doubtless be acted upon , from the
weight of authority of those from whom we have received
it (u) .
Many instances can be found of charters whereby
penalties and forfeitures
in courts have been granted
by
the
crown to subjects (x).
It
does
not
seem very clear

(u) Co. Litt . 114 b. Lord Coke's
explanation
is that " such
fran-
chises and
liberties as cannot
be
seized as forfeited
before the cause
of forfeiture
appear of record ,
no
man can make a title by prescrip-
tion,
because
that
prescription
being an usage in pais, it cannot
extend to such things
as cannot
be
seized without matter
of record
as
to the goods and chattels of traitors ,
felons , &c."
This reasoning
is not
very
clear , but it seems to depend
upon
a tacit assumption
that
no
grant
of the general
right to take
forfeitures
in a particular
court was
ever
known ,
except
as
forming
part of the grant
of a county pala-
tine or other
court
of record , but
this is, as we see, not the case.
(x) For instance , Edward IV. by
charter
granted
to the corporation
of Dover
all penalties
to be for-
feited
of all and
every the
barons
inwhatsoever courts the same barons
should
happen
to
be
adjudged .
And
Charles II . granted
to
the
same
corporation
all
fines ,
for-
feitures , in
the
courts
aforesaid ,
i. e. apparently
any
courts
of re-
cord in the
cinque
ports .

THEORY
OF PRESCRIPTION
.
423
why such a charter may not be presumed by prescription .
Again , a royal grant may be presumed of the franchise of
a court palatine , and this franchise carries with it the right
to the forfeitures , and thus indirectly the right to for-
feitures , may ,
as
is
admitted ,
be claimed
by prescrip-
tion (b).
The franchises
conferring
the right to treasure trove ,
waifs , estrays, and the
like , and to hold
fairs , markets ,
and other similar franchises , may unquestionably
be thus
claimed .
We come now to consider the character and amount of
user which
must
be proved in order to establish a claim
by prescription .
We have already
referred
to
the
fact
that a recent act (c) has materially
altered the law on this
point, but not as regards all prescriptive
rights , inasmuch
as
tithes , rents , and
services , which ,
though
rarely
so
claimed , may
be claimed
by prescription , are
expressly
excepted from the operation of the act.
Moreover it is ex-
pressly provided , that any means whereby the claim might
be defeated
before the passing of the act , other than those
specially
provided
for by the act,
are still
available in
opposing
the claim (d) , except
where the question con-
cerns the use of light
which ,
as
before
remarked ,
is
specially
favoured by the act.
prescrip-
The primary
doctrine
was, that if a person , and those Theory of
under whom
he
claimed ,
had
enjoyed from time im-
rip-
memorial
(i.e. , ever since A.D. 1189 ) the user of an incor-
poreal hereditament , such as an easement, the presumption
of a grant of the easement was irresistible , and the right
was incontestably valid .
To prove this uninterrupted
user
for
several
centuries was obviously
impossible ,
and
was
never required
by the
court , and
a less
amount of evi-
dence was therefore accepted .
If proof were furnished of

In which
case the power
of
the crown to make such grants was
admitted .

and there was no evidence contrary
to the possibility of

consequently there

--
Such
was the theory
of
prescription
;
but
a
further
step
in
this
doctrine
of
presumption
from
a
limited
amount
of evidence was afterwards
made by presuming
the existence
,
not of an ancient
,
but
a
modern grant
;
from
the proof
of
user
,
as
of
right
,
in
a
manner
directly
ad-
verse
to
the interests
of
the landowner
,
for
a
period
of
twenty years
,
although
no evidence whatever
of
the grant
or
of
it
ever having
in
fact existed was produced
(ƒ
).
This presumption
of
a
modern
grant which was in-
vented principally
to
meet the difficulty
in
establishing
a
prescription when evidence
of
non
-
existence
of
the right
at
some remote time was produced
,
was not
so
convincing
as
that arising from the more extended period involved
in
the idea
of
prescription
(
though there can hardly
be
said
to
be
a
difference
in
principle
),
it
was therefore
not
re-
sorted

the

somewhat

not

factory , and
was unquestionably
inconvenient
in
prac-
tice (h).
tion act.
To remedy the
defects
in these methods of acquiring
Prescrip-
title , the act, which
has
already () been
noticed , com-
monly
called
lord Tenterden's
Act (k) was
passed , by
which
the
user which
should
render a title to an ease-
ment indefeasible is defined .
By the first section it is declared that no claim which.
might lawfully be made at the common law, by custom ,
prescription
, or grant , to any right of common or other
profit
à prendre ,
except
such matters
and
things
as
therein
specially
provided for (meaning
right of way or
other
easements
,
watercourses , and lights) ,
shall , if it
have been uninterruptedly
enjoyed by any person claim-
ing right thereto for thirty years , be
defeated
by showing
the commencement of the enjoyment of such rights prior
to the period
of thirty years .
But
any
other mode of
defeating the claim which was before , is to continue to be
available
for
that purpose , except that an uninterrupted
enjoyment
for sixty years (unless had by consent ,
ex-
pressly given by deed or writing) is to confer an absolute
and indefeasible title.
By the next
section , when the right claimed is a right
of way or other easement, or a watercourse , or the use of
any water (1) , the above periods of thirty and sixty years
are reduced
to twenty and forty respectively .
By the third section the claim to the access and use of
light for any dwelling -house, workshop , or other building
if actually enjoyed , otherwise than by consent or agree-
ment in writing , is made indefeasible , after twenty years
user (m), any local
usage or custom to the contrary

a
particular
business , it

withstanding
.
In this case the necessity for proving that
the easement had been used as of right is dispensed
with .
But by other
sections (n) provision is made to meet the
cases where the persons who are interested
in contesting
the right are incapacitated
or only entitled
in reversion ,
and an explanation
is given that nothing
is to be deemed
an interruption
unless it is submitted to for a year (0).
It will be
seen
from the
above
statement
of the act
that if the easement be enjoyed
under
a parol
licence
extending
over the
periods
of thirty
or
twenty
years
(except in
the
case
of light )
this
fact
is
sufficient
to defeat the claim : for then the user would
not be as of
right , and so would not come within the act : and a parol
licence was always at common law sufficient to rebut
the
presumption of a grant (p).
And where the nature of the
right is such that it could not be claimed
as of right , the
act evidently does not apply , for instance where the claim
is to the overflow of water from a canal consequent
upon
boats passing through
the locks of the canal (q) .
Numerous
questions
have arisen upon the construction
of this
act which
cannot here be conveniently

and if there be any series of
inter-
ruptions , each for less than
a year ,
the enjoyment will suffice, although
it be taken against
the will of the
owner , who endeavours to interrupt
it . Ib.
But an interruption
shorter
than a year may have the effect of
showing
that the
enjoyment
was
not as of right.

Somewhat
analogous
to
the
creation
of
incorporeal
Title under
rights by prescription , is the acquisition of a legal title to of limita-
existing
hereditaments , by long enjoyment .
This
species
of title depends entirely upon
statutory enactment , for at
the common law, no length of adverse
possession

to bar the rightful
owner , unless
the land was actually
recovered
from him in a real action
of a particular
form , and he took no steps for reversing
the judgment within
a year
and
a day ;
but
various
statutes
were
successively passed
for limiting the period
for bringing
a writ of right, (formerly
the ordinary mode
of trying the title
to
real
property ) , which , till the
32
Hen. VIII . , was not any certain
period before the com-
mencement
of the suit , but
dated from some historical
event fixed from time to time , as , the beginning of the
reign of Henry I. , the return of king John out of Ireland ,
the coronation of king
Richard
I. , & c . (t).
By the stat .
32 Hen . 8 , c. 2 , the time
for bringing
a writ of right on
the seisin of an ancestor was limited to sixty years from
the commencement of the
adverse
possession ; and for a
possessory
action
on
an ancestor's
seisin , the time
was
fifty years.
No person was to bring a real action , droitural
or possessory
, on his own seisin , after thirty years ; and

TITLE

PRESCRIPTION
,
ETC.
real actions by remaindermen and reversioners , and avow-
ries and conuzances for rents and services
, were limited to
fifty years .
This statute did not limit a right of entry , or
an action of ejectment founded on such right ; nor was the
time for exercising such right limited by the common law,
otherwise than by the somewhat
technical
operation of a
descent cast, discontinuance , or warranty . But the statute
21 Jac.
1 , c. 16, while it limited all writs of formedon.
(i. e. real actions by remaindermen , reversioners , or issue
in tail ) to twenty
years , also
provided , that
no
person
should make entry into any lands , but within twenty years
after his right of entry
accrued ; with a saving of the
rights of persons under disabilities .
But actions in which
it was unnecessary to allege any seisin , such as actions of
dower , escheat, waste, &c.; the
action of quare
impedit ,
by which the right to an advowson is tried ; and suits by
lay
impropriators
for
tithes , remained
free
from
any
limitation
as to time (u).
The
statute of James I. and the previous
statutes of
limitation did not declare, that adverse possession for any
time should extinguish
the title of the rightful owner, but
merely limited his right to recover by action
or entry ;
and hence the law of limitation was formerly
treated
as
belonging
" ad ordinationem litis," forming a branch of
the practice of the courts , rather
than
a substantive
law
of real property (v) ; but now that
the recent statute (x)
has declared (3 ) that lapse of time shall not only bar the
forensic
remedy , but
also shall actually
extinguish
the
right and title of the person out of possession , the law
of the limitation of rights
to real property belongs
more
properly to the present division of the work .
The provisions of the statute are too numerous , and
its
construction
in
some respects
is
too difficult
,
to
allow

more
than
a
general
outline
of
its
operation
being
attempted
in this place .
The greater part of its provisions
are confined to claims
to "land "
and " rent,"
words
which have
a
peculiar
meaning
throughout
the act,—the word " land " signifying
manors , messuages , and all other corporeal hereditaments ,
and tithes (not belonging
to a spiritual
or eleemosynary
corporation sole ) , and also any share , estate , or interest in
them
or any of them , whether of a freehold
or chattel
interest , and of whatever
tenure ; the word
" rent " ex-
tending to all heriots , and to all services and
suits for
which
distress
may
be made , and to all annuities
and
periodical sums of money charged upon or payable out of
any land (except moduses or compositions belonging
to a
spiritual or eleemosynary corporation
sole ) .
But (except
by the provisions
applicable to the recovery of arrears of
rent) the statute does not provide any bar for the recovery
of a rent
reserved upon
a lease for years , that
being
a
mere incident to the reversion ; so that, after non -payment
for more than twenty years , if the
reversion
continues ,
the reversioner's
title to the rent , as distinguished from
the arrears beyond
six years , is
not barred .
The
word
"rent " in the second section , about to be stated , means
the estate in the rents , of which a seisin can be had (≈) .
The second
section enacts generally , that (after the year
1833 ) " no person
shall
make
an
entry
or distress , or
bring
an action
to recover any land
or rent but within
twenty years after
the time at which
the right to make
such entry or distress , or to bring such action , shall
have
first accrued to some person through
whom he claims , or
if such right shall not have accrued to any person through
whom he claims , then within twenty years next after the
time at which the right to make
such
entry

shall have first
accrued
to the person
making
or bringing
the same (a).
This
general
enactment
is explained
and
qualified by
subsequent sections , which
include
within their purview
almost every possible case
; and those few cases , ( such as
claims
under
wills ) , which
are not within any of these
explanatory
clauses ,
have been
held to be left to the
general operation of the second
section (b).
At the common law, the rightful
owner , having
once
been in the actual
seisin of an
estate , could
only
have
been put to his entry by an actual
disseisin
; and there
were many ways in which
a stranger might have been in
the
actual
enjoyment
of the land
for his own
benefit ,
without
having . disseised the true
owner ;
and
during
such non-adverse
possession , the time of limitation under
the stat. of James I. did not run (c).
But the distinction
has
been abolished
by the recent act, which
has
done.
away with
the
doctrine
of
non-adverse possession (d).
This effect is
accomplished by the explanatory
provisions
of which we proceed to notice the most important .
Where the person claiming , or some one through
whom
he claims , having
been in possession
or in receipt of the
profits , shall
have been
dispossessed
or have discontinued.
such possession , the right to enter is to be deemed
to have
first accrued at the time of such
dispossession or discon-
tinuance (e).
And where the claim is made to the
estate
or interest of some person who died in possession or receipt
(a) The
period
is
extended
in
favour
of

session or receipt , the period is counted from his death .
Where the title is derived from an instrument
(not
being
a will ) made by a person being in possession , in
respect of the same estate
or interest , and no possession
has been had under such instrument , the right accrues
at
the time indicated by the instrument .
The right to enter in respect of a remainder or reversion
first accrues on the determination
of the next
preceding
estate , and the remainderman
or reversioner
has twenty
years from that time , except in the cases where his right
is expectant
on the determination
of a tenancy at will ,
from
year to year , for years in certain
cases , or in tail.
And where
a remainderman
or reversioner
has
a right
to enter
for a forfeiture
or
condition
broken , he
may
do so within twenty
years, but
his
neglect to enter on
that ground will
not prejudice
his right on the natural
determination
of the particular
estate .
Where a tenancy at will has been created , it is , for the
purposes of the act, to be considered to have determined
at the end of a year from
its commencement , from which
presumed , or any previous
actual , determination
of the
will , the period of limitation
is to be reckoned ; and the
period barring the right of the true owner runs from that
time , unless
he obtains
from
the
occupier a
sufficient
acknowledgment
of title in writing (f).
A cestui que
trust or mortgagor
in possession is considered at law as
tenant at will to his
trustee
or mortgagee , but it is ex-
pressly provided , that such a tenancy shall not constitute
adverse possession .

of the act upon the rights of a mortgagee out of posses-
sion (g) were removed by the stat . 7 Will . 4 &

the last payment of any principal or interest
under
the
mortgage (h).
Where the possession is in a tenant " from year to year
or
other period ," without writing , the time
is counted
from
the end of the first of such years or other periods ,
or the last payment of rent ().
Where the possession is under
a lease in writing , re-
serving a yearly rent of twenty shillings or upwards , the
period
may
commence
before the determination
of the
term , viz ., if the rent has been received by some person
wrongfully claiming it as the immediate
reversioner , time
runs from
the first of such receipts , provided
no subse-
quent
payment
has
been
made to the
true
owner (k).
And
the
landlord
is
barred
for
the benefit , not of the
tenant , but of the
person so wrongfully
receiving the
rent ( ) .
Mere discontinuance of the receipt of the rent is
no bar ; there must be a wrongful
payment to another (m).
But where there is a lease in writing , and no pecuniary
rent to the
amount of twenty
shillings is reserved , the
period is reckoned from the determination of the tenancy .
Possession

to the issue in tail
did not for-
merly ( ) commence to be adverse to the remainderman

Such person , or those
claiming
through
him ,
are allowed ten years from the time of the cesser of such
disability .
But this provision
does not extend ( as the old
statute did (y)) to a succession of disabilities
, and whatever
disabilities
may have existed , the claim is barred
at the
end of forty years .
No part of the United Kingdom , nor
the islands of Man , Guernsey , Jersey , Alderney , or Sark ,
nor any island adjacent to them (being part of the British
dominions ) , shall be deemed

the
act (2) .
Any
acknowledgment
of the title of the
person entitled
to any land
or rent signed by the person
in possession or receipt of the profits of the land or of the
rent , creates
a new epoch in all these
cases , from which
time begins to run against the claimant (a) .
We have hitherto
dealt with the operation of the statute
upon actions
at law, but by a further
section (b) , the bar
is extended to all suits in equity , with
a few exceptions .
Where there is an express trust in favour of the claimant ,
time shall begin to run against him only from the moment
when the land
or rent
has
been conveyed for
valuable
consideration to a purchaser without notice of the trust (c).
Again , where fraud
constitutes
the ground of the equit-
able demand , the
time
begins
to run from the
moment
when the fraud
was , or might with reasonable
diligence
have been, discovered (d) ;
the usual
protection
afforded
by the court to bonâ fide purchasers for valuable
conside-
ration without
notice being
reserved , as well
as all other
rules of the court in refusing
relief on the ground of ac-

annexed by
law to some illegal
act ,
or negligence , in the owner of
lands , tenements
, or hereditaments
: whereby he loses his
interest
therein , which
thereupon
either vests in the per-
son immediately
suffering
the injury , or in the crown , or
in
some other
functionary
occupying
a position
repre-
sentative of public interests .
When the forfeiture
is to the crown , the land
does
not
vest in the crown ,
ipso facto by the cause of forfeiture ,
but it is only after a solemn
inquisition
on behalf of the
crown
and the finding by the jury of the facts and re-
cording the same , or as it is phrased , upon " office found ,"
that the land
becomes the
property
of the
crown (a).
And when the
forfeiture
is to a subject , as for instance
the lord of the fee , the title, except against him, remains
unaffected
by the forfeiture
;
but the land is
subject to
the entry of the lord for the forfeiture (b).
Lands , tenements , and hereditaments , may be forfeited
in various
degrees
and by various
means :
1. By crime .
2. By alienation
contrary
to law.
3.
By wrongful
dis-
claimer .
4. By non -presentation
to a benefice ;
when
the
forfeiture
is
denominated
a lapse.
5.

I. We have already (d) had occasion to notice so much
of the law of forfeiture
by the crime of the
tenant
as is
sufficient in this part of these
commentaries .
As we
there noticed , the ancient rigour of the law has been much
relaxed
in this respect : moreover , the common
practice
of the government of conferring
upon the family or rela-
tions
of the offender the
interest
which
accrues to the
crown by the forfeiture (e) has still further diminished
the
substantial
importance
of this law : which , however , in
its
present form
,
is
well suited
to
the ends
of
justice
.
The
nature
of the
crimes and the
particular
circumstances
under which
the forfeiture
is

Lands and tenements may

contrary

This

either alienation

ALIENATION CONTRARY
TO LAW .

having
been in
ancient
times
chiefly made by religious
houses , the
consequence of which
was that
the
lands
became perpetually inherent in one dead hand , the general
appellation
of
mortmain
came
to
be
applied
to
such
alienations ,
and
the
religious
houses
themselves to be
principally
considered
in framing the
various
ancient
statutes
of mortmain
: in deducing the history of which
statutes , it will be matter of curiosity to observe
the great
address
and
subtle
contrivance
of the
ecclesiastics
in
eluding from time to time the laws in being , and the zeal
with which
successive
parliaments
have
pursued
them
through all their finesses : how new remedies were
still
the
parents of new
evasions : till the legislature
at last ,
though with difficulty , obtained a decisive victory .
mortmain.
By the common law any man might dispose of his lands
to any other private
man at his own discretion , especially
when the feudal
restraints
of alienation were worn away.
Yet, in consequence
of these it was always , and is still Licences in
necessary (g), for corporations
to have a licence in mort-
main from the crown to enable them to hold (h) lands ; for
as the king is the ultimate
lord of every fee , he ought not ,
unless by his own consent , to lose his privilege of escheats
and other feudal profits , by the vesting of lands in tenants
that
can never be attainted
or die.
There
are
traces of
licences of mortmain
among the Saxons , above sixty years
before the Norman
conquest , though the extent
of their
application seems
doubtful (i).
But ,
besides
this general
licence from the king , as lord paramount of the kingdom ,
it was also requisite , whenever there was a mesne or inter-
mediate lord between the king and the alienor , to obtain
his
licence
also ,
(for
the
same
reasons founded
upon
feudal principles , ) for the alienation of the
specific land .
And if no such
licence was obtained , the king or other

lord might respectively enter on the
land
so
aliened
ir
mortmain
as
a
forfeiture
.
The
necessity
of
this licence
from the crown was acknowledged by the constitutions
of
Clarendon
(k),
in
respect
of
advowsons
,
which the
morks
always greatly
coveted
,
as
being
the groundwork
of
sub-
sequent appropriations
.
Yet
,
such were the influence and
ingenuity of
the
clergy
,
that
(
notwithstanding
this
fundamental
principle
)
we find that the largest
and most
considerable dotations
of
religious
houses happened within
less than two centuries after the conquest
.
And
(
when
a
licence could not be obtained
),
their contrivance
seems
to
have been this
:
that
,
as
the forfeiture
for such alienations
accrued
in
the first place
to
the immediate lord
of
the
fee
,
the tenant who meant
to
alienate first conveyed his lands
to
the religious
house
,
and
instantly took
them
back
again
,
to
hold
as
tenant
to
the monastery
;
which kind
of
instantaneous
seisin
was probably
held
not
to
occasion
any forfeiture
and then
,
by pretext
of
some other for-
feiture
,
surrender
or
escheat
,
the society entered into those
lands
in
right
of
such their newly acquired
seigniory
,
as
immediate
lords
of the
fee
.
But
,
when these dotations
began
to
grow numerous
,
it
was observed that the feudal
services
so
highly valued
in
those
days were
every day
visibly withdrawn
;
that the circulation
of
landed property
from man
to
man began
to
stagnate
;
and that the lords
.
were
curtailed
of
the fruits
of
their
seigniories
,
their
escheats
,
wardships
,
reliefs
and
the like
;
therefore
in
order
to
prevent
this
,
it
was
ordained by the
second
of
king Henry III.'s great
charters
(1),
and afterwards
by
that printed
in
our
common
statute
-
books
,
that
all
such
attempts by religious
houses
should fail
in
their object
,
and the land should be forfeited

LICENCES
IN
MORTMAIN .
441
But , as this prohibition
did not extend beyond religious
houses , bishops
and other sole corporations were not in-
cluded in it : and the aggregate ecclesiastical bodies (who ,
sir Edward
Coke
observes
(n ) , in this
were to
be
com-
mended , that
they
ever had of their
counsel the best
learned men that they could
get) found
many means to
creep
out of this
statute , by buying
in lands
that were

as lords of the

art or ingenuity , appropriate

of the kingdom , under the
name of common recoveries , were invented .
The honour
of their discovery , such as it is , rests with the clergy (0) .
Statute of
But very soon afterwards
the statute of Westminster
the
second, 13 Edw .
1 , c. 32 , A.D.
1285, enacted , that in such
cases a jury shall try the true right of the demandants or
plaintiffs to the land , and if the religious
house or corpo-
ration be found to have it, they shall still
recover seisin ;
otherwise it shall
be forfeited
to the immediate
lord of
the fee , or else to the next lord , and finally to the king ,
upon the immediate
or
other
lord's
default .
And the
like provision was made by the succeeding
chapter (p), in
case
the tenants
set up
crosses
upon their lands
(the
badges of knights templars
and
hospitallers ) in order to
protect them
from the feudal demands of their lords , by
virtue
of the privileges
of those
religious
and military
orders.
So careful
indeed was this
provident
prince to
prevent
any
future
evasions, that when the statute of
Quia
emptores ,
18 Edw . I. , abolished
all sub-infeuda-
tions , and gave liberty for all men to alienate their lands
to be holden
of their
next immediate
lord (9) , a proviso
was inserted (r) that this should
not extend to authorise
any kind of alienation in mortmain . And when afterwards
the method of obtaining
the king's licence by writ of ad
quod damnum had been sanctioned by the statute 27 Edw.
1 ,
st. 2 , it was

Yet still it was found difficult
to set bounds
to ecclesi-

ingenuity
; for when they were driven
out of all
their former holds , they devised or turned to this object a
new method
of conveyance, by which the lands
were
granted , not to themselves directly , but to nominal
feof-
fees to the
use of the
religious
houses ;

ALIENATION
IN
MORTMAIN .
445
In
modern
times
many
large
charitable
and
other
corporations
have been
founded or incorporated by act of
parliament ; whenever this is done , and the necessities
of
the
case
require it, power is always given
by the act to
hold lands without licence in mortmain , that is , so as to
exempt them from the penalty of forfeiture
( c) .
By the
act now in force , under which incorporated companies for
trading and other purposes are formed , power is given to
them to hold lands (d ).
Such is the law of mortmain
which
is now in force
as
regards the forfeiture which
is incurred .
We see that the
penalty
arises
from the land being vested in a corporation
without licence to hold , and it rests entirely upon the an-
cient laws which we have noticed .
But though not falling
within the proper limits of our present subject , it will be
convenient
here
to notice
other
laws
commonly
called
mortmain laws , which
have
been
made by the authority
of parliament , closely allied
with those which
we have
been exhibiting, and arising out of the same principles.
of policy , which
have
imposed
restrictions
upon
the
alienation
of
land ,
not
unlike
those
we
have
been
describing , but
which
have
their
effect, not
by creating
a liability
to forfeiture
but
by declaring
the attempted
alienation ,
when

uses
declared
that
all future
grants
of lands for any of the
purposes
aforesaid , if granted
for any longer term than
twenty years
should
be void .
By virtue
of this Act the
land reverts at once to the grantor (e).
This
statute of Hen. VIII . specifies the superstitious
uses which were to invalidate
a grant of land , but there
is
no
statute which
makes
superstitious
uses in general
void(f)
nevertheless , by the general policy of the law,
they were, and are not
allowed
to have effect (g) .
But
this general policy did not , in the opinion
of the judges ,
extend to render void a gift of lands
made for charitable
purposes (h) , even though they be thereby impressed with
trusts to continue
in perpetuity .
Lands given to a cor-
poration for charitable purposes were , of course , liable
to
forfeiture , but the gift was valid
as against
the
donor ;
and, therefore , a man
might give
lands
for the
main-
Charitable
tenance of a school , an hospital , or any
other charitable
uses , subject
only
to the risk (which in modern practice
proved to be
nothing ) of the crown
insisting
upon
the
forfeiture of the lands vested
in the corporation .
But it
was apprehended , from recent experience , that persons on
their death-beds might make large and improvident
dis-
positions
even for these good purposes , and
defeat
the
political
ends
which had the grounds
of the statutes of
mortmain
; it is therefore enacted
by the statute 9 Geo. 2 ,
c. 36 , that
no lands
or tenements , or money to be laid
out thereon , shall be given for or charged with any charit-
able
uses
whatsoever , unless by deed
indented , executed
in the presence of two witnesses , twelve
calendar months
before the death of the
donor , and enrolled in the Court
of Chancery within six months after its execution

be without power of revocation :
and that all
other gifts
shall
be void ( ) .
The
two
universities , their
colleges ,
and the scholars
upon the foundation of the colleges of
Eton , Winchester
, and Westminster
, are
excepted out of
this act (k).
Other
public
charities
have , by subsequent
statutes , been exempted from the operation
of the act,
amongst
which are the
British
Museum (1), Greenwich
Hospital (m ), and the Foundling Hospital (n) .
It has been thought , and with
seeming
correctness ,
that
the exemption
does
not
release
the
incorporated
charities from the old restraints of the mortmain laws , so
that
a licence of the
crown to hold
lands
remains
still
necessary
when a college or one of the other incorporated
charities purchases lands or an advowson
without
having
such license (o).
The act contains
an exception
as regards the necessity
for a year to elapse from the date of the conveyance
to the
death of the grantor , when the conveyance is bonâ fide for
an adequate
and valuable consideration , though the other
requisites , such as inrolment, are to be observed in this as
in other cases (p) . The effect of these statutes upon a gift
which contravenes their
provisions is to render it simply
void ; the land , notwithstanding
the attempted alienation ,
remains the property of the donor , and vests in him or his

act is
now
commonly ,
though
inaccurately ,
described
as
the Mortmain Act.

subject
to
a proviso , limiting
the
number of advowsons which
a col-

was
afterwards

Opinion
upon the subject
of conveyance
of lands
for
charitable
uses
has somewhat changed since the last cen-
tury, and many acts have been
passed , not however wholly
repealing
the act of Geo. II. ,
but giving facilities
for
rectifying
defects in
titles ,
which
have
arisen
through
disregard of it (r) .
Moreover
some of the
provisions
of
the act as to the conveyance being
by indenture , and as
to the non -reservation of any benefit for the donor , have
been altered (8).
Many special exceptions
also have been introduced by
the legislature
diminishing
the number of cases to which
the
act applies .
Thus
conveyance for sites of
schools
limited to two
acres ,
are
to be valid though
only
one
witness attests them ; and the death of the donor within
the twelve months does not invalidate
them
(t) .
Similar
relaxations
have
been
permitted
in favour of literary ,
scientific , and other institutions
of the like character
(u).
The church building acts
also
contain
provisions
for the
same purpose (x) .

Secondly , alienation
to an alien
is
also
a
cause
of
forfeiture to the crown of the land so alienated .
For an
alien cannot hold
lands , although
he
may take
them
as
grantee , and upon inquisition
and office found the crown
may
take them by virtue of the
royal
prerogative .
In
this , however , as in other cases , the title is good against all
but the crown .
And if the alien before office found grant
the lands over to a subject , the latter
receives a perfectly

III . A third
instance of forfeiture
is
from
its
infre- III . For-
feiture by
quency rather within the
domain of theory than that of disclaimer
practice .
It occurs
upon
the civil crime of disclaimer ;
as, where
a tenant
who
holds
of any lord neglects
to
render him the due services, and , upon an action
brought
to recover them , disclaims
to
hold of his
lord .
Which
disclaimer
of tenure in any court of record is a forfeiture
of the lands to the lord (a) , upon reasons most apparently
feudal .
And
so likewise
there
is
a forfeiture if in any
court of record
the
particular
tenant does any act which
amounts
to
a virtual
disclaimer .
It is said that if he
claims
any greater
estate
than was granted
him at the
first
infeudation ,
or
takes
upon
himself those
rights
which
belong
only to tenants of a superior
class (b) ; or
if he affirms the reversion to be in a stranger , by accept-
ing
his fine, attorning
as his tenant , collusive pleading ,
and the like (c) ; such behaviour amounts to a forfeiture of
his particular
estate .

forfeits his lease (d).
But what amount of conduct
other
than disclaimer
by record will in the present day be con-
sidered a ground of forfeiture in the absence of contract , it
is difficult to
say.
Mere
payment of rent to a stranger
is no forfeiture (e), and the tortious effect of attornment
no longer exists ().
IV. Lapse is a species
of forfeiture , whereby
the right
of presentation
to
a church
accrues to the
ordinary by
present to a neglect of the patron
to present , to the
metropolitan
(9)
by neglect
of the
ordinary ,
and to the king by neglect
of the metropolitan .
For , it being
for the interest of
religion ,
and the
good of the public, that the
church
should be provided with
an officiating
minister ,
the law
has therefore given this right of lapse , in order to quicken
the patron , who might otherwise , by suffering the church
to remain vacant , avoid paying his ecclesiastical dues , and
frustrate the pious intentions of his ancestors
.
This right
of lapse was first established about the time (though
not
by the authority
( h) ) of the council of Lateran (¿) , which
was in the
reign
of our
Henry the
Second, when
the
bishops
first began to exercise universally
the right of
institution to churches (k).
And therefore , where there is
no right of institution
, there is no right of lapse :
so that
no donative
can lapse to the
ordinary ( ), unless it
has
been augmented by the Queen's bounty (m).
But no right
of lapse can accrue, when the original presentation is in
the crown (n).

But , if the bishop
be both patron and ordinary , he shall
not have a double
time
allowed him to
collate

for the
forfeiture
accrues by law, whenever the negligence has continued six
months in the same person .
And also if the bishop does
not collate
his
own clerk immediately
to the living , and
the
patron
presents ,
though
after the six months
are
lapsed ,
yet
his
presentation
is good ,
and the
bishop is
bound to institute the patron's
clerk (q) .
For as the law
only gives the
bishop
this title by lapse , to punish
the
patron's
negligence , there is no reason that , if the bishop
himself be guilty of
equal
or
greater
negligence ,
the
patron
should
be deprived
of his turn .
If the bishop
suffer the presentation to lapse to the metropolitan
, the
patron also has the same advantage if he presents
before
the archbishop has filled up the benefice ; and that for the
same reason.
Yet the ordinary cannot , after lapse to the
metropolitan , collate his own clerk to the prejudice of the
archbishop (r).
For
he
had
no
permanent
right and
interest in the advowson ,
as the patron has, but merely
a temporary one ; which having neglected to make use of
during the time , he cannot afterwards retrieve it.

But to prevent
this
inconvenience ,
the law
has
lodged a power in the patron's
hands
of as it were com-
pelling the king to present .
For , if during the delay of
the
crown , the
patron
himself presents , and his clerk is
instituted , the king
indeed by presenting
another
may
turn out the
patron's
clerk
;
or ,
after
induction ,
may
remove him by quare impedit : but, if he does
not , and
the patron's

lost his right, which was only to

In case the benefice becomes

of

the
patron
is
bound to take notice of the vacancy at his own peril ; for

are

case
of a

or

for insufficiency , these
being matters of which the bishop
alone is presumed
to be cognisant , here the law requires
him to give notice thereof to the patron ; otherwise he can
take no advantage by way of lapse (y) .
Neither shall any
lapse
thereby accrue
to the metropolitan
or to the king ;
for it is

true , that

presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical
benefice for money , gift , or reward .
It is so called from
the resemblance it is said to bear to the sin of Simon
Magus , though
the
purchasing
of holy orders
seems
to
approach
nearer to his
offence .
It was by the canon law
a very grievous
crime
and is so much the more odious ,
because , as sir Edward
Coke
observes , it is ever accom-
panied
with perjury ; for the presentee is sworn to have
committed
no simony (c) .
However , it was not an offence
punishable
in a criminal
way at the common law (d) ; it
being thought
sufficient to leave the clerk to ecclesiastical
censures .
But
as
these did
not affect the
simoniacal
patron , nor were efficacious
enough to repel the notorious.
practice of the thing , divers
acts of parliament
have been
made to restrain
it by means of civil forfeitures .
Upon
this ground they find a place in this chapter .
By the statute 31 Eliz . c . 6 , ss . 4 , 5 , it

that if any

incapable of ever enjoying the same

Upon these statutes many questions

simony
.
And
,
among
others
,
these points
seem
to
be clearly
settled
:
1.
That
to
purchase
a
presentation
,
the
living
being
actually
vacant
,
is
open and notorious
simony
(e):
this
being bad
at
common law
as
well
as
expressly
in
the face
of
the
statute
.
2.
That for
a
clerk
to
bargain
for the
next
presentation
,
the incumbent
being sick and about
to
die
,
was
simony
,
even before the statute
of
queen Anne
(
ƒ
),
and now
,
by that
statute
,
to
purchase
,
either
in
his own
name
,
or
another's
,
the next
presentation
,
and be there-
upon presented
at
any future
time
to
the living
,
is
direct
and palpable simony
.
But
,
3.
It
is
held that for
a
father
to
purchase such
a
presentation
,
in
order
to
provide
for
his son
,
is
not simony
:
for the son
is
not concerned
in
the bargain
,
and the father
is
by nature bound
to
make
a
provision
for him
(g
),
and
if
the purchase be made with-
out
a
view
to
any particular
clerk
it
is
good
,
even though
the incumbent be
to
the knowledge
of
both patron and pur-
chaser
in
extremis
(h).
4.
That
if
a
simoniacal contract
be
made with the patron
,
the clerk not being privy thereto
,
the
presentation for that turn shall indeed devolve

,

CHAPTER XIX .
TITLE
BY
JUDGMENT AND
BANKRUPTCY
.
ONE of the primary
duties which a man owes to society
is the due discharge of all
his
pecuniary debts and lia-
bilities
;
correlative
to this there
necessarily
exists ,
or
ought to exist , a function of the law, that of enforcing
the discharge
of this duty .
And
one of the
most
ob-
vious modes of doing this seems
to be by insisting upon
the application
of the
debtor's
property to this purpose .
By the
common law of England , however , no provision
payment of was made by which a creditor could
obtain
satisfaction of
debby

his debt from the real
property
of
his debtor

great an extent
of

be

.
Such laws as now fulfil this function
owe
their
exist-
ence entirely
to
statutory enactment
.
The object
in
view
,
as
we have
stated
,
seems
to
be simple
;
yet
it
has not
been found
easy
to
devise satisfactory measures for ac-
complishing
it,
and the present
condition
of the law can
be described
as
little more than transitory
;
and
in
view
of
the
change
now
in
progress
we shall
not dwell longer
than
is
necessary
to
exhibit
the
outlines
of
the
present
law
,
without
entering into detail
.
We have seen
(a)
that by the Statute
of
Westminster
2,
as
enlarged
by
a
recent
act
,
some
provision
was intro-
duced by the legislature by which
a
creditor gained
means
of
applying the rent and profit
of
land
in
payment
of
his
debt
.
This
,
though
useful
,
is
not
so
complete
a
remedy
as
is
required
,
nor
is
it
so
effectual
as

debts made
upon lands.
By an act passed
in the year
1838 (b) , it was
declared Judgment
that a judgment recovered
against a debtor should become , a charge
subject
to
certain conditions , a charge enforceable in the
court of
Chancery ,
upon
all
lands
belonging
to the
debtor
at the
time of entering up the judgment , or any
time afterwards (c).
The
effect
of this
change was that
an order could be obtained , in a suit in equity instituted
for the purpose , for a sale of the
lands , thus for the
first
time
enabling
a
creditor
to
force
a sale of
his
debtor's
lands .
It was necessary for the creditor
to register
his judg-
ment in the court of Common
Pleas , as a means of giving
notice
to other persons dealing with the
same debtor of
his right(d) ;
and in order
to keep the charge alive
as
against
subsequent judgment creditors , it was necessary
to re-register at intervals of five years (e).
Many objec-
tions to the provisions of this
act were found in practice ,
and in the year
1860
a further
alteration
was made by
which
it was rendered
necessary, in order to obtain
a
charge, that not only
should
a judgment
be registered ,
but a writ of execution
issued and registered (f).
This
was further
altered
by a subsequent
act
of the year
1864 (g), by which the creditor must , before he gains any

After

to

court of
Chancery for an order for sale of the lands ( ).
It would
seem from the language of the last act ( ¿) , that a creditor
who
has
thereunder
obtained
a
charge will
be
able
to
enforce it even against
a subsequent bond file purchaser
from the debtor , without
notice of the judgment ; it may
have been considered perhaps that after the land has been
delivered over by the sheriff under the writ of elegit it is
impossible
for any
person
dealing
with the
land to be
ignorant of the fact .
The act affords a glaring
example
of the imperfections
attending
our
English
method of
amending law by
ill
-
considered legislation
.
Some defects
have
already
been
pointed
out
(k).
We
may
add the

following amongst
many other difficulties
which the
act

has
introduced
.
First
,
since
an
equity
of

cannot
be extended under an elegit
,
it
would
seem
that
a
judgment
creditor
of
a
mortgagor
is
powerless
to
reap
the benefit
of
his judgment
out
of
the land
in
mortgage
.
Again
,
if
land has already been delivered
in
execution
,
a
second judgment
creditor
would
be
remediless
,
for the
sheriff will not
,
and indeed obviously
cannot
,
deliver the
same land twice
;
therefore
,
although the first
creditor's
debt may only amount
to
half the value of the land
,
the
second creditor could take no advantage of the
existence
of
the
property
.
Possibly
,
these
difficulties
might
in
some degree be surmounted by the courts declaring
the
creditor
,
thus left out

,

We may here
notice that by the aid of suits in the Land of a
court of Chancery , the land of a deceased
debtor can now debtor

taken
from
the
heir
or
devisee
,
to
be
applied
in
the

of
payment
of
his
ancestor's debt
.
This liability
depends payment
of
upon another series
of
statutes by which
it
has been slowly
established
,
the
completeness
which
now
exists
being
however
of
but very recent date
.
For
it
seems clear that
in
the fourteenth century an heir
,
unless expressly bound
by the deed
of
his ancestor
,
was free from any liability on
his ancestor's account except
to
the king
(
m
).
If
,
however
,
the ancestor had
bound himself and his heirs by deed
,
they
being
expressly
mentioned
,
and
creating
thereby
what
is
in
modern
phrase
called
a
debt
by
specialty
,
by which the heir was bound
,
the latter was compelled
to
see that the debt was paid
out
of
the personalty

,
in

,
to
pay
it
to
the
extent
of

,

were
therefore
called
assets

This
doctrine
,
however
,
could
not extend
to
devisees
,
for
devises
were
not then permitted
;
and afterwards
,
when
a
will
of
lands
was allowable
,
the
devisee
not being
included
under the
term heir
,
took the lands
free
even
from his
ancestor's

:

a

case the court of Chancery enforced the
execution of the
trust in favour of all the creditors equally .
Next the act 3 & 4 W. & M. c. 14
(0) , declared that a
devise to defeat
the debt of the testator by specialty in
which
the
heirs
were
expressly
bound
should
be
con-
sidered
fraudulent
and
void
as
against
such
creditor ,
unless the devise was for payment of debts generally
(p).
But now , by a very recent act (9 ) , when
any person
dies
seised
of or
entitled
to
any interest
in
any
lands
or
hereditaments , whether corporeal or incorporeal , which
he
shall not have charged by his will with , or devised subject
to, the payment of debts, the same
are made assets , to be
administered in courts of equity for the
payment
of all
his
debts .
But
the
act preserves the preference
which
before existed in favour of those creditors by specialty in
whose favour the heirs are bound .
It will be noticed that
the act
excepts from
its operation
those
estates
which
have been devised for payment
of debts.
These , there-
fore, are still
administered
under the court
as within its
ordinary
jurisdiction
over
trusts ,
and
with the
same
equality of distribution
as obtained before (r) .
Such is the present remedy given to
a creditor
against
his
debtor's lands .
But , in addition
to the
case of a
judgment obtained by an individual
on his own behalf,
another remedy for creditors is provided by law, by which
lands and all the debtor's property are made available for
the payment of his debts .
This is when he
becomes
a
bankrupt .
The laws relating
to bankruptcy
have received
many
alterations
in recent
times , and are in process
of
still further
modification .

CHAPTER XX .
Of title by
alienation
TITLE
BY ALIENATION.
THE
most usual
and universal
method of acquiring
a
title to real
estates
is that of alienation
;
under
which
may be comprised any method wherein
estates
are volun-
tarily resigned
by one man ,
and
accepted by another :
whether that be effected
by sale , gift ,
marriage
settle-
ment , devise,
or other transmission
of property
by the
mutual consent of the parties .
This means of taking estates
by alienation
is
not
of
in general.
equal antiquity
in the law of England with that of taking
them by descent.
For we may remember that , by the
feudal law, a pure and genuine
feud
could
not be trans-
ferred from one feudatory to another without
the consent
of the lord ; lest thereby
a feeble
or suspicious
tenant
might have been
substituted
and imposed upon him to
perform the feudal services , instead of one on whose abili-
ties
and
fidelity
he
could
depend.
Neither
could
the
feudatory then subject the land
to his
debts : for , if he
might, the feudal restraint of alienation would
have
been
easily frustrated
and
evaded (a) .
And ,
as he could
not
aliene it in his lifetime , so neither could he by will defeat
the
succession , by devising his feud to another family ;
nor
even alter
the course of it , by imposing
particular
limitations ,
or prescribing
an unusual
path of descent.
Nor, in short , could he aliene the estate , even with the
consent of the lord , unless he had also obtained the
con-
(a) Feud . 1. 1, t. 27.


IN GENERAL .
465
sent of his
own
next
apparent
or presumptive
heir (b).
And therefore it was very usual in ancient feoffments
to
express that the alienation
was made by consent of the
heirs of the
feoffor ; or sometimes
for the heir apparent
himself to join with the feoffor in the grant (c) .
And , on
the other hand , as the feudal obligation
was looked upon
to be reciprocal , the lord could
not aliene or transfer his
seignory without the
consent of his vassal :
for it was
esteemed unreasonable
to
subject
a feudatory
to a new
superior , with whom
he
might
have
a
deadly
enmity ,
without
his
own
approbation
;
or even to transfer
his
fealty , without
his being
thoroughly
apprized of it , that
he might know with certainty
to whom his renders
and
services were due, and be able to distinguish a lawful
distress for rent from
a hostile
seizing of his cattle , by
the lord of a neighbouring
clan (d ).
This consent of the
vassal was expressed by what was called
attorning
(e) , or
professing to become the tenant of the new lord : which
doctrine
of attornment
was
afterwards
extended
to all
lessees
for life
or years.
For if one
bought
an estate
with any lease for life or years standing
out thereon , and
the lessee
or tenant refused to attorn
to the
purchaser ,
and to become his
tenant , the grant or contract was in
most cases void , or at least
incomplete (f) ; which was
also an additional
clog upon alienations .

restrained .
The road was cleared in the first place by a
law of king Henry I. , which
allowed
a man
to sell
and
dispose of lands which he himself had purchased ;
for
over
these
he
was thought to
have a more
extensive
power than over what
had been transmitted
to him in a
course of descent from his ancestors (h): a doctrine which
is countenanced by the feudal constitutions
themselves (?) :
but he was not allowed
to sell the whole of his
own
ac-
quirements , so
as totally to disinherit his children , any
more
than
he
was
at
liberty
to
aliene
his
paternal
estate (k).
Afterwards ,
a man
seems
to have
been
at
liberty to part with all his own
acquisitions , if he had
previously
purchased
to him
and his
assigns by name ;
but, if his assigns were not specified in the purchase deed ,
he was not empowered to aliene ( 1) : and also he might
part with
one -fourth of the
inheritance
of his ancestors
without
the consent of his heir ( m ).
By the great charter
of Henry III. (n) ,
no
subinfeudation
was
permitted
of
part of the land , unless sufficient was left to answer the
services
due to
the superior
lord , which
sufficiency
was
probably
interpreted
to
be
one half
or
moiety
of the
land (o).
But these restrictions
were in general removed
by the statute of quia
emptores (p ) , whereby all persons ,
except the king's tenants
in capite, were left at liberty to
aliene all or any part of their
lands
at their own
discre-
tion (q) .
And
even these tenants
in capite were by the
statute
1 Edw . 3, c. 12 , permitted
to aliene , on paying a
fine to the king (r).

IN
GENERAL .
467
c. 3 , and 3 Hen. 8 , c. 4 , all persons attending
the king
in his wars were allowed
to aliene their lands
without
licence ,
and were
relieved
from
other
feudal
burdens .
And
lastly, these very fines for alienations
were , in all
cases of freehold
tenure , entirely abolished by the statute
12 Car. 2 , c. 24.
As to the power of charging
lands with
the debts of the owner , this was introduced
so early as
statute Westm. 2 (s) , which
subjected
a moiety
of the
tenant's
lands
to executions , for debts recovered by law ;
as the whole of them was likewise
subjected to be pawned
in a statute
merchant
by the
statute
de
mercatoribus
,
made
the
same year , and in a statute
staple by statute
27 Edw. 3, c. 9, and in other
similar recognizances by
statute
23 Hen. 8 , c. 6.
And
now , the whole of them is
not only subject to be pawned for the debts of the owner ,
but
likewise
to be absolutely sold for the benefit of his
creditors
in the manner
appearing in the last chapter .
The
restraint of devising
lands by will, except in some
places
by particular
custom ,
lasted
longer ;
not
being
totally removed , till the abolition of the military tenures .
The doctrine of attoruments
continued still later than any
of the
rest , and
became
extremely troublesome , though
many
methods
were invented
to
evade it ; till at last ,
they were , by statute 4 & 5 Ann . c. 16 , made no longer
necessary to complete the grant
or
conveyance ; and by
statute
11 Geo . 2 , c. 19 , the attornment
of any tenant is
declared not to affect the possession of any lands , unless
made with consent of the landlord , or to a mortgagee after
the mortgage is forfeited ,
or by direction of a court of
justice.
An attornment , then , is now unnecessary ; never- Necessity
theless, it is not altogether
useless , for
after an attorn- ments
ment, in an action by the landlord
against
the tenant , it
is unnecessary to adduce evidence of the plaintiff's title :
unless ,
indeed, the
tenant
shows that
he had
attorned
by mistake (t).

I. Who may

to whom.
Incapacity
of traitors,
In
examining
the
nature
of
alienation , let
us first
inquire briefly , who may aliene , and to whom ; and
then ,
more at length , how a man
may aliene , or the
several
modes of conveyance.
I. Who may aliene , and to whom : or , in other words ,
who is capable of conveying and who of purchasing .
And
herein we must consider rather the incapacity , than
capa-
city, of the several parties ; for all persons are prima facie
capable both of conveying and purchasing , unless the law
has laid them under any particular
disabilities
(u) .
:
Persons
attainted of treason , felony , and praemunire ,
felons, &c.
are incapable
of making a completely valid
conveyance ,
from the time of the offence committed , provided attainder
follows ( )
for such conveyance by them
may tend
to
defeat the king of his forfeiture , or the lord of his escheat.
The conveyance , however , is good for all purposes except
as
against
the crown
or lord .
But they
may purchase
for the benefit of the
crown ,
though
they are disabled
to hold.
We have already pointed out the extent of the
forfeiture
in
different
cases .
So
also,
corporations , re-
ligious or others , may purchase
lands ; yet , unless
they
have a licence to hold in mortmain , they
cannot
retain
such
purchase ; but it shall , with
a few exceptions , be
forfeited to the lord of the fee (x) .
Corpora-
tions.
Idiots , &c.
Idiots and persons of unsound
mind , and
those
who,
being
born
deaf
and blind,
are
not distinguished
from
(2) Until lately there were many
exceptions to the general
power of
alienation .
Thus
mere
rights
of
entry
or of property
without
any
estate, contingent
interests , and the
like ,
were
not
capable
of being
aliened , though
they
might be re-
leased .
See Co. Litt. 214 ;

and
similar
restric-

But by the Wills

these were made devisable
; and by

alienable by deed, estates tail being
of course excepted .

idiots (y),
infants ,
and
persons
under
duress ,
are
not
totally disabled either to convey or purchase , but sub modo
only .
For their conveyances
and purchases
are voidable ,
but
not
actually
void .
This
position
has
been
esta-
blished by degrees.
The king , indeed , on behalf of an
idiot, might
always
avoid
his
grants
or
other
acts (z) .
But it was
formerly
said, that
a
non
compos
himself, Plea of
though he be afterwards
brought
to a right mind , should teney.
not be permitted
to allege his
own insanity in order to
avoid such grant : for that no man
shall
be allowed
to
stultify himself, or plead his own disability.
The pro-
gress of this notion was somewhat curious .
In the time
of Edward I. , non compos was a sufficient
plea to avoid a
man's own bond ( a) : and there is a writ in the register (1)
for the
alienor himself to recover lands
aliened by him
during his insanity
; dum fuit non compos
mentis
suæ , ut
dicit, &c.
But
under
Edward III.
a scruple
began to
arise , whether
a man
should
be
permitted
to
blemish
himself, by pleading
his
own
insanity ( c) :
and ,
after-
wards , a defendant in assise having
pleaded a release by
the
plaintiff,
since
the last continuance ,
to
which
the
plaintiff
replied (ore tenus , as the manner then was) that
he
was
out of his
mind
when
he
gave
it, the
court
adjourned
the
assise
; doubting
whether , as the plaintiff
was sane both then and at the commencement of the suit ,
he
should
be permitted
to plead an intermediate
depri-
vation of reason ; and the
question
was
asked , how he
came to remember the release , if out of his senses when he
gave it (d) .
Under Henry VI . this
reasoning
(that
a
man should not be allowed
to disable himself, by plead-
ing his own incapacity , because he could not know what he
did under such a situation ) was seriously adopted by the
judges
in argument (e) ;

his insane
ancestor.
And from
these loose authorities ,
which Fitzherbert
does
not
scruple
to
reject
as
being
contrary to reason (f) , the
maxim
that a man shall not
stultify himself was
treated
as
settled
law (9) .
They
have, however , been
overruled , and it is now settled
the
other way , that
a man himself (h) , as well
as his
repre-
sentatives (1) , may establish his lunacy in order to impeach
a deed which he has executed .
If a contract , however,
entered into by an idiot lunatic with
another
without
any notice of the incompacity , be so far carried into effect
that the parties cannot be restored to their former rights ,
it will be supported (j) .
The contracts of an infant are not absolutely void, for
he may ratify them on attaining
majority
; they are void-
able only (k) .
But they must be actually
ratified , either
expressly
or by necessary implication
from conduct , else
they
may be set
aside after
the infant's
death
by his
representatives .
With the aid of the Court of Chancery
infants
may make binding settlements on marriage

Persons
also , who
purchase

may affirm or avoid such transaction , whenever the duress
is ceased (m ) .

The case of a married woman is, as the law now stands , Feme
somewhat different .
She may purchase an estate without
the consent of her husband , and the conveyance is good
during the coverture , till he avoids it by some act declaring
his dissent (o).
And , though he does nothing
to avoid it ,
or even if he actually
consents
, she herself may , after the
death of her
husband , waive
or
disagree to
the
same
:
nay , even her heirs may waive it after her , if she
dies
before
her
husband ,
or if in her
widowhood
she does
nothing to express her consent or agreement ( p ) .
But
the conveyance or other contract of a feme covert , with cer-
tain exceptions , is absolutely void and not merely voidable ,
and , therefore , cannot be affirmed
or ratified by any sub-
sequent agreement (g).
The exceptions are as follows :-
First, a married
woman may , with the concurrence of
her husband , dispose of or disclaim any estate or interest
in real estate , or money subject to a trust to be laid out in
the purchase of real
estate or any reversionary
interest
in personalty (not settled by her marriage
settlement , and
when the deed
or instrument
under which
she claims is
dated subsequent to the 31st Dec. 1857 (r) ) by executing

to say, she must acknowledge her free consent to the deed ,
upon an examination
apart from her husband by a judge
or two of the commissioners
appointed for that purpose .
Previously
to the
passing of the last -mentioned
act, a
married woman
could
only deal with her real estate by a
fine or recovery , that is, by one of the fictitious
proceed-
ings of which we have before spoken .
And previously
to
the year 1858 , when the restricted power above noticed was
conferred
upon
her by the legislature , a married
woman
could not deal with any reversionary interest in personalty ,
by any means whatever .
Her husband
could , of course ,
make an assignment which would be valid against himself
or his representatives and bind the fund if it fell into pos-
session during the
coverture , subject
only to the equity
to
a settlement
in
favour of the wife
out
of the fund,
which the court
of chancery has
established ;
but the
concurrence of the wife with her husband
had simply no
effect, and if she survived her husband , and the fund fell
into possession after his death , it became
hers free from
any incumbrance (†) .
Before the Fines and Recoveries Abolition Act , in most
manors
a husband
and wife
could
surrender
copyhold
tenements
belonging
to the wife
so as to effect
a valid
alienation ,

wife

The
doctrine
is that
a wife
shall
have
as against her husband
or his
assignees
a provision
by
way
of
settlement
upon
herself
and
chil
dren out of any personalty
belong-
ing to her which may fall into pos-
session during the
coverture ; the
amount
of which will be so settled
is wholly within
the
discretion
of
the court .

It arose originally
in those cases where the
husband
was obliged
to have recourse
to the
court to assist him in
obtaining
possession of the money , and the
court , as a price of its
assistance ,
insisted
upon the settlement .

MODES
OF ALIENATION .
475
also remember that the owners of dignities , peerages
and
the like , are incapable of aliening
them (j) .
We
are next , but principally, to inquire , how
a man
may aliene or convey ; which will lead us to consider the
several modes of conveyance.
In consequence of the
admission
of property ,
or the
giving a separate right by the law of society to those
things
which
by the law of nature
were in common ,
there was necessarily some means to be devised , whereby
that
separate
right
or
exclusive
property
should
be
originally
acquired ;
which
we
have
more
than
once
observed, was that of occupancy or first possession
.
But
this possession , when once gained , was also necessarily to
be continued ;
or else , upon one man's
dereliction of the
thing
he had seized , it would again become
common , and
all those mischiefs
and contentions
would
ensue , which
property
was
introduced
to prevent .
For the
purpose ,
therefore , of continuing
the possession , the municipal law
has established
descents
and
alienations : the former
to
continue
the possession in the
heirs
of the
proprietor ,
after his involuntary
dereliction
of it by his death ; the
latter
to continue it in those persons to whom
the pro-
prietor , by his own voluntary act, shall choose to relinquish
it in his life-time .
A translation
, or transfer , of property
being thus admitted by law, it became
necessary that this
transfer should be properly evidenced
in order to prevent
disputes , either about the fact , as whether
there was any
transfer at all ;
or concerning
the persons , by whom and
to whom it was transferred
; or , with regard to the subject
matter, as
what the thing
transferred
consisted of;
or
lastly ,
with
relation
to the mode
and
quality of the
transfer , as for what period
of time
(or , in other words ,
for what estate and interest ) the conveyance
was
made .
The legal
evidences
of this translation
of property
are common
called the common
assurances of the kingdom
; whereby

TITLE
BY ALIENATION .
every man's estate is assured to him , and all controversies ,
doubts , and difficulties
are either prevented or removed .
These common
assurances are of four kinds :-1 .
By
matter in pais , or deed
; which is an assurance transacted
between two
or more
private
persons
in pais , in
the
country ; that is (according to the old common law) upon
the very spot to be transferred .
2.
By matter of record ,
or an assurance transacted only in the king's public courts
of record .
3. By special custom , obtaining
in some par-
ticular places, and relating
only to some particular
species
of property .
Which three are such as take
effect during
the life
of the party
conveying
or
assuring .
4. The
fourth takes
no
effect till after his death ; and that
is
by devise, contained in his last will and testament .
In a former
chapter (k), when
treating
of copyholds ,
we had
occasion
to dwell upon
the peculiar
mode by
which they
are aliened .
Our third head, which applies
to copyholds
only , has therefore
been
sufficiently
dealt
with.
Of the others we will treat in order.

CHAPTER XXI .
ALIENATION
BY
DEED .
IN
treating
of deeds
we
will
consider , first,
their
general
nature ;
and , next , the several sorts or kinds of
deeds , with their respective incidents , and the manner in
which they take
effect.
And , in explaining
the former ,
we will
examine ,
first , what
a
deed
is ; secondly , its
requisites ; and thirdly, how it may be avoided .

and delivered

by the parties (a).
It is sometimes
called
a
charter ,
carta, from its materials
; but most usually , when applied
to the transactions of private
subjects , it is called a deed ,
in
Latin
factum ,
κar'
¿§oxǹv ,
because
it is
the
most
solemn
and
authentic
act that a man
can possibly
per-
form , with relation
to the
disposal of his property ; and
therefore a man shall always be estopped
at law, by his own
deed , or not permitted
to aver or prove anything in con-
tradiction
to what he has once so solemnly and deliberately
avowed , though
in
equity this rule
is not
adhered to
when justice
requires
otherwise (b) .

by more parties
than
one , there ought
to be regularly
as
many copies of it as there are parties , and each should be
cut or indented (formerly in acute angles
instar dentium ,
like the teeth of a saw, but
at present in a waving line)
on the top or side , to tally or correspond with the other ;
which
deed ,
so
made , is called
an indenture ( c) .
For-
merly , when
deeds
were more concise than
at
present ,
it was
usual to write
both
parts
on the same piece of
parchment , with
some
word
or letters
of the
alphabet
written between them ; through which the parchment
was
cut , either in a straight
or indented line, in such a manner
as to leave half the word on one part , and half on the
other .
Deeds thus made were denominated syngrapha by
the
canonists (d) ;
and
with us
chirographa ,
or hand-
writings (e) ; the word
cirographum or cyrographum being
usually that which was divided
in making the indenture .
But at length
indenting
only has come into use , without
cutting
through
any letters
at all ;
and
even this
now
serves no other purpose than to give a name to the species
of the deed (ƒ ) .
And the legislature
has declared that
a deed
purporting
to be an
indenture
shall have
the
effect of one , whether actually indented or not (g) .
When
the several parts of an indenture are interchangeably
exe-
cuted by the
several parties , that part
or copy which is
executed by the grantor
is
usually
called
the
original ,
and the rest
are
counterparts :
though of late it is most
frequent for all the parties
to execute every part ; which
Deed-poll.
renders them all originals .
A deed made by one party
only was not indented , but polled
or shaven quite even ;
and therefore
called
a
deed -poll,
or
a
single
deed (h).
The
distinction
between
indentures
and
deeds -poll was
formerly
important ,
as it was
held
that
every person
who took an immediate
benefit under an indenture

be
a party to it , whereas this was not the
case under a
deed -poll, to which , indeed , there being only the grantor
a party, it would
have been inoperative if the
same rule
had
applied .
This ground
of
distinction
is
now
done
away with, for by the act just referred
to , any person not
a party to an indenture
may take an immediate
interest
under
it.
The
only
essential
importance
which now
remains
in
the
question
as to whether
an instrument
ought to be a deed -poll
or indenture
depends upon the
necessities imposed by acts of parliament
( ?) .
of a deed.
and subject-
matter.
We are in the next
place to consider the requisites of Requisites
a deed.
The first of which is , that there be persons able 1. Parties
to contract
and be contracted with , for the purposes in-
tended by the
deed (k) :
and
also
a thing
or
subject-
matter to be contracted for ; all which must be expressed
by sufficient names ().
So, as in every grant there must
be a grantor , a grantee , and
a thing granted
; in every
lease a lessor , a lessee , and a thing demised .
ation.
Secondly , the
deed
must
be founded
upon good and 2. Consider-
sufficient consideration .
:
As to what
is a good consideration , sufficient to sup-
port the deed , it is in some
cases difficult to determine .
A grant , made without
any consideration , is , as it were ,
of no effect
for it is construed
to enure , or to be effec-
tual , only to the use of the grantor
himself (m).
Yet
mere inadequacy of consideration , where there is no fidu-
ciary relation between the parties , is not sufficient ground
for
impeaching
the
deed (n).
The
consideration
may
be either a good or a valuable one .
A good consideration
is such as that of blood , or of natural
love and affection ,
when a man
grants
an estate to a near relation , being
founded
on motives of generosity , prudence , and natural

duty ; a valuable
consideration is
such
as money , mar-
riage , or the like , which
the law
esteems
an equivalent
given
for the
grant (o) ;
and
is
therefore
founded in
motives of justice .
Conveyances made upon good
consi-
deration only , are considered as merely voluntary
, and are
frequently
set aside in favour of creditors , and bonâ fide
purchasers .
For by a statute passed
in the reign of queen
Elizabeth ( p) , it is
enacted
that a conveyance
of
lands
(of whatever
tenure (7 ) ) for the purpose
of defrauding
Voluntary
purchasers
for
valuable
consideration ,
shall
as
against
such purchasers be void .
The
construction
put upon this
act is that the mere fact of the conveyance being
for no
valuable
consideration , i. e. ,
a voluntary
conveyance , is
sufficient
evidence of fraud within
the
act (r) .
Con-
sequently a subsequent
purchaser for valuable
considera-
tion gains a perfect
title , notwithstanding
the voluntary
deed , and that even if he has notice of it (s) .
But the

for contracts , in the Third Volume of these.
Commentaries (y).
We see, then , that a good consideration , as it is called ,
is not sufficient to ensure the validity
of the deed , and , in
fact, the expression has little
other meaning
than
to dis-
tinguish
the
intention
of the
deed
from
that
where an
illegal or immoral purpose is the object . A deed executed
with or for a consideration of the latter kind is absolutely
void.
A bona fide valuable
consideration
of more than
mere nominal amount
is , therefore , a requisite to make
a
deed absolutely good .
The deed ought to show clearly on
the face of it what
the consideration
is , not only in order
that
there
should
be
no
fraud
upon
the
revenue in
respect of the stamp , but also to obviate all questions of
fraud as between the parties .
Yet in the absence of such
fraud, an incorrect
and consequently improper
statement
of the consideration
does not vitiate the
deed (z) , though
it casts upon those who introduce it the serious responsi-
bility of proving that no fraud was intended (a ) .
must be
printed on
parchment.
Thirdly , the
deed
must
be written , or printed
; it may 3. Deed
be in any character or any language , but it should be upon written or
paper
or parchment .
For it is said that if it be written
paper or
on
stone ,
board ,
linen ,
leather ,
or
the
like , it
is no
deed (b).
Wood
or stone may be
more
durable ,
and
linen
less
liable
to
rasures ; but writing
on paper
or
parchment
unites
in itself, more
perfectly
than
in
any
other
way , both
those
desirable
qualities :
for
there is
nothing
else
so durable , and at the same time so little
liable
to
alteration
;
nothing so secure from alteration ,
that is at the
same time
so durable .
It must also have stamps.

The

not , however , absolutely void for want of a stamp , for on
payment of a penalty the
deed
may always be stamped :

with
a
small additional

For it is not
absolutely

formal
parts
that
are usually drawn out in deeds , so as
there be sufficient words to declare clearly and legally the

We
had
occasion to
notice
a few
instances in
which
technical
language
is
essential ,
as

when the

There
is also a further progressive
duty depending
upon the length of
the
deed.

were
somewhat

"heirs " to create a fee -simple , and words of procreation
to create a fee -tail ;
but in general
no special form of
words
is necessary.
Formerly
the
word
" warrant
’
used by a grantor
or feoffor had a special force and effect,
binding him and his heirs
not only to forego all title ,
however derived , to the land , but
also to compensate the
grantee in case of eviction (e).
The word " grant " also
was considered
to carry with it the
force of a warranty
valid
as against the grantor (ƒ) though
not
extending to
his
heirs
as
also the
word
" give " (g).
The
former
word
has
received
a
sanction
to this
construction
by
several
acts
of parliament
(h) .
Again , the word " ex-
change ,"
in a
deed
of
that
character implied
a war-
ranty to the extent of the
lands
received in
exchange.
These
technical
expressions
have ,
however ,
lost their
force , partly through disuse
and
also
by the
indirect
and
direct
effect of several
acts of parliament (i),
and
they are not
now
relied
on in
conveyancing .
Except ,
therefore ,
as
above -mentioned ,
a
conveyancer
is
not
restricted
in the language he may employ : nevertheless ,
certain
forms
of
expression
having
been
universally
adopted , great
convenience follows
from their invariable
use ; whereas much trouble and uncertainty
would be in-
troduced
by the use of new expressions .
Consequently
the phraseology
of
formal
deeds
is found
to be pretty
uniform ;
the
tendency
of the
present
day ,
however ,
is to a considerable
extent
to revert
as far
as
is pos-
sible to the simplicity and

order
should
not be departed from without good reason ; therefore we
may shortly
describe what that order is in a conveyance.
First , the date, and the name and
descriptions of the
parties are set forth , followed
immediately
by the recitals
of
such
deeds ,
agreements ,
or
matters
of fact ,
as
are
necessary to explain the reasons upon which the present
transaction
is founded (k) .
In
these
recitals
there
often
appears the consideration
upon which the
deed
is made,
and a general description of the subject matter (D).
Then is
introduced
the
operative
part of the
deed ,
prefaced usually
by the words " now this indenture
wit-
nesseth ," or other similar words . Here is commonly
stated.
in
precise
terms
the
consideration , if not
sufficiently
mentioned in the recitals .
These premises , constituting
the vital part of the
deed , are followed by the habendum
Habendum. and tenendum .
The office of the habendum
is properly
to
determine what estate or interest is granted by the deed :
though
this
may
be performed ,
and sometimes
is per-
formed in the premises .
In which
case the habendum
may enlarge , explain , or qualify , but not totally contra-

usually
con-

releases, in which it is presumed the
parties
do not intend
to do more
than
the
history
of
facts
and
statement of intention
contained in
the
recitals
indicate .
Yet
mere
general
words
contained
in
the
operative part may be controlled
so
as to have a restricted
meaning by
the
recitals ,

there
is
an
ambiguity
in the

part, the recitals
may be referred
to in order to discover the meaning .

As , if a

vice versa ; here A. has an

a

But , had it been in the premises
" to him and his heirs ," habendum
" to him for life ," the
habendum
would be utterly void (n ) ;
for an estate
of in-
heritance is
vested in him before the habendum
comes ,
and shall not afterwards be taken away or divested by it.
If the premises
do not
indicate
the estate which
is
granted , then the
habendum is essential to the deed , or at
least to render it free from
ambiguity , for in such a case
the grantee , if he take anything at all under the premises ,
can do so only
by implication

not very

It was sometimes formerly used
to signify the tenure by which
the estate granted was to

viz . " tenendum

But ,
all
these being
now reduced to free and common
socage , the tenure
is
never
specified.
Before
the
statute
of quia

18 Edw. I. , it was also sometimes used to denote the lord
of
whom
the land
should
be holden :
but that statute
directing all future purchasers to hold , not of the imme-
diate grantor , but of the chief lord of the fee , this use of
the
tenendum
has been long antiquated ;
though
for
a
long time after we find it mentioned in ancient charters ,
that the tenements shall be holden de capitalibus dominis

dendum or reservation , whereby
the grantor
creates
or
reserves
some new thing to himself out of what
he
had
before granted , as " rendering
therefor yearly the sum of
ten shillings, or a pepper corn , or two days ' ploughing , or
the like " ( p) .
Under
the
pure
feudal
system,
this
render , reditus , return or rent , consisted , in chivalry , prin-
cipally of military
services ,
in villenage , of
the
most
slavish
offices
;
and in
socage , it
usually
consists
of
money, though it may still
consist of services , or of any
other certain profit (9 ) .
To make a reddendum good , if it
be of anything
newly created by the deed , the reservation
must
be to the grantors , or
some , or one of them , and
not to any
stranger
to the deed (r).
But if it be of
ancient services or the like , annexed to the land , then the
reservation may be to the lord of the fee.
We must distinguish
between exception
and a reserva-
tion .
The
former , meaning
that a part of the
whole
hereditament
which
has
been
described
is not to pass ,
should
obviously
be
mentioned
in the
" parcels "
or
description
of the subject -matter of the grant
;
as when
the grant is " of all that house except the rooms
on the
basement ," or " all that piece of land except the under-
wood " (s).
" A reservation is always of a thing
not in
esse , but newly
created or reserved out of the land
or
tenement " granted (†) , that is , something
issuing
out of
the land , not part of the land itself, and not issuing
out
of any other land or thing ( u) .
Another
of the
terms
upon which
a grant may be
made is a condition
; which is a clause of contingency , on
the happening
of which the
estate
granted
may be de-
feated ; as " provided always , that if the mortgagor
shall
pay the mortgagee

nants , or
conventions ,
which
are clauses of
agreement
contained in a deed , whereby
either
party
may stipulate
for the truth of certain
statements , or may bind himself
to perform , or give , something
to the other.
Thus , the
grantor may covenant that he has a right to convey ; or
for the
grantee's
quiet
enjoyment
;
or
the
like : the
grantee
may covenant to pay his rent , or keep the pre-
mises in repair ,
&c.
If the
covenantor ,
as
is
usual , Covenan
covenants
for himself
and his
heirs , it is then
some-
times
called a covenant real (x) , and descends
upon the
heirs ; who are bound to perform it, provided
they have
assets by descent, but not
otherwise ; if he covenants
also
for
his
executors
and
administrators , his
personal
assets,
as well
as his
real , are likewise
pledged for the
performance of the covenant ; which makes such covenant.
a better security than any warranty .
These covenants for title in purchase deeds
are usually
restricted
so as to extend only
to the acts and omissions
of the grantor , and all persons through whom he claims by
descent or devise, but
do not go beyond the acts of the
last
purchaser
of the
estate .
In mortgage
deeds
the
practice is different , as it is invariable
that
a mortgagor
gives absolute covenants for title.
Covenants
on the part
of the grantee
are
sometimes
inserted restricting
the
free
use of the land and giving
rights to the grantor in respect of adjoining
land retained
by
him.
Such
covenants
are,
of
course ,
enforceable
against the covenantor personally
;
but how far they will
continue to be binding
upon the land in the hands of sub-
sequent
owners

nicest character .
The general result of the cases
seems to
be, that , except where by reason of notice
or otherwise ,
there
would
be
a breach of good faith in violating the
covenant, the burden of it does not continue to bind sub-
sequent owners (y).
We may notice , however , that an important
distinction
has
been
established
between
covenants
entered
into
between landlord and
tenant
and those between vendor
and purchaser ; the former
being much more favoured in
law ; as seems reasonable from the continuing
nature of
the relation existing between the parties , and also because
such covenants
being
between persons interested
in the
same land and relating
solely to that land , do not
consti-
tute any impediment
to
its
free alienation
,
further than
arises from the fact
of
there being the two parties
-
the
landlord
and tenant
.
Lastly
,
comes
the
conclusion
,
which
mentions
the
execution and date
of
the
deed
,
or
the time
of
its being
given
or
executed
,
either
expressly
,
or
by reference
to
some day and year before mentioned
(~).
Not but
a
deed
is
good
,
although
it
mention no date
,
which indeed
in
early
times was very common
:
or
bears
a
false
date
;
or
even
if
it
has an impossible date
,
as
the thirtieth
of
February
;
provided the real day
of
its being dated
or
given
,
that
is
delivered
,
can
be
proved
.
For
then
the
day
of
de-
livery constitutes the date
of
the deed

of it, which
is
necessary, wherever
any of the
parties desire it, though
not otherwise (b) ; and , if it be
not done on his request , the deed is void as to him . If
he
can, he should
read it himself : if he be blind
or
illiterate, another
must
read it to him, if he request it .
If it be read falsely , it will be void ; at least for so much
as is mis -recited : unless it be agreed
by collusion
that the
deed shall be read false , on purpose to make it void ; for
in such case it shall bind the fraudulent
party (c).
and signing.
Sixthly , it is requisite
that the party , whose deed
it is 6. Sealing
should
seal it.
The
use of
seals , as a mark of authen-
ticity to
letters
and
other
instruments
in
writing , is ,
extremely ancient .
We read of it among the Jews
and
Persians
in
the
earliest
and
most
sacred
records
of
history (d).
And in the book of Jeremiah there is a very
remarkable
instance , not
only of an attestation by seal ,
but also of the other usual formalities
attending
a Jewish
purchase (e).
In the civil law also (f),
seals were the
evidence of truth ; and were required , on the part of the
witnesses
at least , at the attestation of every
testament .
But in the times of our
Saxon ancestors , they were not
much
in
use in England .
For
though
Sir
Edward
Coke (g) relies
on an instance of king Edwin's making
use of a seal about an hundred
years before the conquest ,
yet it does not follow that this was the usage among the
whole
nation
and perhaps the charter he mentions
may
be of doubtful
authority , from this very circumstance , of
being
sealed ;
since we are assured by all our
ancient

historians , that
sealing
was
not
then in common
use.
The method of the Saxons
was for such
as could
write
to subscribe their names, and , whether
they could write
or
not , to affix
the
sign of the
cross :
which custom
illiterate
persons do , for the most part , to this day keep
up ; by signing
a cross for their mark, when unable
to
write
their names.
It was very common
also
to
attach
some instrument , the handle of a knife or other similar
object to the deed ,
as
a symbol
of the property
trans-
ferred ( ).
This
inability to write , and therefore making
a cross
in its stead, is honestly avowed by Caedwalla , a
Saxon king , at the end of one of his charters () .
In like
manner , and for the
same
unsurmountable
reason , the
Normans , a brave but illiterate nation , at their first settle-
ment in France , used the practice of sealing only , without
writing
their
names :
which
custom
continued ,
when
learning
made its way among them , though the reason for
doing it had ceased ; and hence the charter of Edward the
Confessor to Westminster Abbey , himself being brought
up in Normandy , was witnessed
only by his seal , and is
generally thought
to
be the oldest sealed
charter of any
authenticity
in England ( ) . At the conquest , the Norman
lords brought
over into this kingdom
their own fashions
;
and
introduced waxen
seals only , instead of the English
method of writing their names , and signing with the sign
of the cross ( ).

were
fit
to

seals

The impressions
of
these
seals were sometimes
a
knight
on
horseback
,
sometimes
other
devices
:
but
coats
of
arms were
not
introduced
into seals
,
nor indeed
into any other
use
,
till
about the reign
of
Richard
the
first
,
who
brought
them from the
crusade
in
the holy
land
;
where they were first invented
and painted on the
shields
of
the knights
,
to
distinguish
the variety
of
per-
sons of every christian
nation who resorted
thither
,
and
who could
not
,
when clad

,
be
otherwise
known
or
ascertained
.

of

it
himself
,
or

,

in

was not

essential
to
the validity
of
a

as
such
,
though
this
point
since the
statute
of

is
not altogether
free
from
doubt
(o).
No
prudent
person
now
would
think
of
executing
a

the provisions
of several
acts
of parliament
and prin-
cipally the one just mentioned ( 29 Car. 2 , c. 3, the Statute
of Frauds ) , signature by the party or by an agent lawfully
authorised
in writing , is
rendered
necessary for many
purposes .
That
statute
requires
such
signature
in the
following among other cases ; the assignment , grant,
or
surrender
of leases , estates , or interests
of freehold
for
years , or any uncertain interest in lands , tenements ,
and
hereditaments , not being copyholds .
This certainly
seems
to include all assurances by deed , though the opinion that
it
does
so is by no
means
universal
(2) .
The
statute
provides also that contracts for sale of lands , tenements ,
or
hereditaments ,
and
declarations
of trust
relating to
them , not arising by operation of law, must be in writing ,
duly signed by the party or his agent (r) .
A seventh
requisite
to
a good
deed
is
that it
be
delivered , by the
party himself or his certain attorney :
which
therefore
is
also
expressed in the
attestation ;
" sealed
and delivered ."
A deed
takes effect only from
this
tradition
or delivery
; for, as we before said , if the
date be false
or impossible , the
delivery ascertains the
time of it.
And if another person seals the deed , yet if
the
party
delivers
it himself,
he
thereby
adopts
the
sealing (s) ,
and by a parity of reason the
signing
also ,
and makes them both his own .
A delivery may be either
absolute , that is, to the party or grantee himself ; or to a
third person, to hold till some conditions
be performed on
the part of the grantee : in which
last
case it is
not
delivered as a deed , but as an escrow ; that is , as
a scroll
or writing , which is not to take effect as
a deed till the
conditions
be performed ;
and then it is a deed to all
intents
and
purposes ( ).
This delivery
constitutes

are in reality nothing
more than an
improvement
or amplification
of the brevia testata men-

writers ( c) ;
which
were
written
memorandums , introduced
to perpetuate the tenor of the
conveyance and
investiture , when
grants
by parol
only
became the foundation of frequent dispute and uncertainty .
To this end they registered
in the deed the persons
who
attended
as witnesses , which was formerly
done without
attestation. their signing their names (that not being always in their
power), but they only heard the deed read ; and then the
clerk or scribe added their names , in a sort of memoran-

ment.
Original conveyances are the following : 1. Feoffment ;
2. Gift : 3. Grant ; 4. Lease ;
5. Exchange
;
6. Partition
:
derivative are , 7. Release ; 8. Confirmation
;
9. Surrender ;
10. Assignment
;
11. Defeazance .
1. A feoffment , feoffamentum, is a substantive
derived
from the verb , to enfeoff, feoffare or infeudare , to give one
a feud : and therefore feoffment is properly donatio feudi (t).
It is the most ancient
method of conveyance, the most
solemn and public , and therefore the most easily remem-
bered
and proved .
And it may properly
be defined , the
gift of any corporeal hereditament
to another by the deli-
very of seisin and possession of the thing given (u).
He
that so gives , or
enfeoffs , is called the feoffor ; and the
person enfeoffed
is denominated the feoffee .
This is plainly derived from , or is indeed itself the very
mode of the ancient
feudal
donation ; for though it may
be performed by the word " enfeoff " or " grant," yet the
aptest word of feoffment is , " do or dedi " (v).
And it is
still directed and governed by the same feudal
rules
; in-
somuch that the principal
rule
relating
to the extent and
effect of the feudal grant, " tenor
est qui
legem dat feudo,'
is in other words become
the maxim of our law with rela-
tion to feoffments , " modus
legem dat donationi ” (x) . And
therefore as in pure feudal donations the lord, from whom
the feud moved, must
expressly limit
and
declare
the
continuance
or
quantity
of estate
which
he meant
to
confer, " ne quis plus
donasse
præsumatur , quam in dona-
tione expresserit : " so , if one grants by feoffment lands or
tenements to another , and limits or expresses no estate , the
grantee
(due
ceremonies
of law being
performed )
has
merely an estate for life (y) .
For, as the personal liabili-
ties of the
feoffee
were
originally presumed to be the
immediate or principal
inducements
to the feoffment , the

feoffee's
estate
ought to be confined
to his person
and
subsist
only for his life : unless
the feoffor , by express
provision
in the creation
and constitution
of the estate,
has given it a longer
continuance .
These express pro-
visions
are indeed generally
made ; for this was for ages
the only conveyance , by which our ancestors
were wont to
create an
estate
in fee -simple (x) , by giving the land
to
the feoffee , to hold to him and his heirs for ever ;
though
it
serves
equally well to convey any other estate of free-
hold (a).
seisin.
But by the mere words of the deed
the feoffment is by Livery of
no means perfected , there remains
a very material
cere-
mony to be performed ,
called
livery
of seisin ; without
which the feoffee has but a mere estate at will (6 ) .
This
livery of seisin
is no other than the pure feudal
investi-
ture ,
or
delivery
of corporal
possession of the land
or
tenement ; which was
held
absolutely
necessary to com-
plete the donation . " Nam feudum
sine investiturâ nullo
modo constitui potuit " (c) : and an estate was only perfect ,
when, as the author of Fleta expresses it in our law, "fit
juris et seisinæ
conjunctio
” (d) .
The advantage of this mode of conveyance in ancient
times no doubt
consisted in the publicity of it, for when
writings were, to say the least , rare , it was necessary that
the evidence of right should
be preserved by those whose
personal
interest in the matter would engage their atten-
tion .
Therefore
the ceremony took
place on the land , in
the
presence of
the
neighbours ,
who ,
should
litigation
subsequently
arise , would constitute at once the witnesses
and the jury to decide the right.
Moreover , it was thought
a matter of high policy that
no secret dealing
with the
possession
of land should be encouraged .
With
our
Saxon
ancestors
the delivery of a turf was
a necessary
solemnity , to
establish

lands (e) .
And , to this day , the conveyance of our copy-
hold estates is usually made from
the seller to the lord or
his steward by delivery of a rod or verge, and then from
the lord to the purchaser by re-delivery of the
same, in
the presence of a jury of tenants .
Conveyances in writing were the last and most refined
improvement .
The
mere
delivery
of possession , either
actual or symbolical , depending
on the ocular
testimony
and remembrance of the witnesses , was liable to be for-
gotten or misrepresented , and became frequently
incapable
of proof.
Besides , the new
occasions
and
necessities ,
introduced
by the advancement
of commerce ,
required
means to be devised of charging
and encumbering
estates ,
and of making
them liable to a multitude
of conditions
and minute designations for the purposes of raising money,
without an absolute
sale of the land ; and sometimes the
like proceedings
were found
useful
in order
to
make
a
decent and competent provision for the numerous branches
of a family, and for other domestic views .
None of which
could be effected by a mere simple , corporal
transfer
of
the soil from
one man to another , which was principally
calculated for conveying
an absolute unlimited
dominion .
Written deeds
were therefore
introduced , in order to spe-
cify and perpetuate the peculiar purposes of the party who
conveyed
yet still , for a very long series of years , they
were never made use of, but in company with the more
ancient
and notorious
method of transfer , by delivery of
corporal
possession.
But until recently
a deed was not
necessary
for a feoffment , though
the
Statute of Frauds
required
a writing (f).
The
act to amend the law of
real property now requires a feoffment to be by deed (9).
Livery of seisin , by the common law, is necessary to be
made upon every grant of an estate of freehold in here-
ditaments
corporeal ,
whether of inheritance
or
for life

only .
In incorporeal
hereditaments it is impossible to be
made ; for they are not the
object of the senses
and in
leases for years, or other chattel
interests , it is not neces-
sary.
In leases for years indeed an actual entry is neces-
sary to vest the estate in the lessee ; for the bare lease
gives him only a right to enter , which
is called his interest
in the term , or
interesse
termini : and , when he
enters in
pursuance of that right, he is
then , and not before, in
possession of his term , and complete
tenant for years (h) .
This
entry by the tenant
himself serves
the purpose of
notoriety , as
well
as
livery
of seisin
from the grantor
could
have done ; which it would
have been improper
to
have given in this
case , because
that solemnity is appro-
priated to the conveyance of a freehold .
And this is one
reason why freeholds
cannot by a common law assurance
be made to commence in futuro , because they cannot (at
the common law) be made but by livery of seisin ; which
livery , being an actual manual tradition of the land , must
take effect in præsenti , or not at all (¿) .
On the creation of a freehold remainder , at one and the
same time , with a particular
estate for years , we have
before seen that
at the common law livery must
be made
to the particular tenant (k).
But if such a remainder be
created afterwards , expectant
on a lease
for years now in
being, the livery must not be made to the lessee for years ,
for then it operates nothing ; " nam quod semel meum
est,
amplius
meum esse non potest " (); but it must be made to
the remainder -man himself, by consent of the
lessee for
years
for without
his consent no livery of the possession.
can
be given (m) ;
partly
because
such
forcible
livery
would be an ejectment of the tenant from his term , and
partly for the reasons before given (n) for introducing
the
doctrine of attornments .

Livery in

Livery of seisin is either in deed , or in law.
Livery in
deed
is thus
performed .
The feoffor , lessor, or his
at-
torney , together with the feoffee , lessee , or his
attorney ,
(for this may as effectually
be done by deputy
or duly
authorised
attorney , as by the principals themselves in
person) come to the land , or to the house ; and there , in
the
presence of witnesses ,
declare
the
contents of the
feoffment
or lease , on which
livery is to be made.
And
then the feoffor, if it be of land , delivers to the feoffee , all
other persons being out of the ground , a clod or turf, or a
twig or bough
there growing , with words
to this effect :
"I deliver
these to you in the name of seisin of all the
lands
and tenements
contained in this
deed ."
But if it
be of a house, the feoffor must take the ring , or latch of
the
door , the
house being
quite
empty , or at least
the
person in
possession
being
a consenting
party (o) ,
and
deliver it to the feoffee
in the same form ; and then the
feoffee must enter alone , and shut
to the door , and then
open it, and let in the others (p) . If the conveyance or
feoffment
be of divers
lands , lying
scattered in one and
the same county , then in the feoffor's possession
, livery of
seisin of any parcel , in the name of the
rest , suffices for
all (9) ; but if they be in several counties , there must
be
as many liveries as there are counties .
For, if the title to
these lands comes to be disputed , there must be as many
trials
as there are counties , and
the jury of one
county

(like that of other
attestations ) , was still
reserved
to the pares or jury of the county (s) .
Also , if the lands
be out on lease, though all lie in the same county , there
must be as many liveries
as there
are tenants : because
no livery can be made in this
case but by the consent of
the particular
tenant ; and the
consent of one will not
bind the rest (t).
And
in all these
cases it is prudent ,
and usual , to endorse the livery of seisin on the
back of
the
deed ,
specifying
the
manner ,
place , and time
of
making it ; together with the names of the witnesses (u) .
And thus much for livery in deed .
law .
Livery in law is where the same is not made on the Livery in
land , but in sight of it only : the
feoffor saying to the
feoffee , " I give you
yonder
land ,
enter
and take
pos-
session ."
Here , if the
feoffee
enters during the life of
the feoffor , it is a good livery, but not otherwise ; unless
he dares
not
enter,
through
fear of his life
or bodily
harm
and then his continual
claim , made yearly , in due
form
of law, as near
as
possible
to the lands (x) , will
suffice
without
an entry (y).
This livery
in law cannot
however
be given or received by attorney , but only by the
parties
themselves (~) .

sality with which
it was
employed , a circumstance
that
cannot but be
attended with great interest .
It is now
however , and has for some time been , out of use , with
the single
exception of the
customary alienation of land
of gavelkind
tenure by an infant, for, as we have
seen ,
an infant of the age of fourteen years or upwards may by
feoffment
convey lands of this
tenure (a) .
A feoffment
under this custom
is an exception to the rule that a deed
is requisite .
It only remains
to remind the reader
that
the tortious
effect which feoffments formerly had , whereby
a feoffment by a particular
tenant as a tenant for life con-
veyed by wrong , as it was said , a fee - simple , thereby putting
the remainder -man to his legal remedy to recover the pro-
perty, has been abolished , and now such a feoffment would
but convey the estate for life , and have
no further
or
other effect (b).
2. The
conveyance by gift , donatio , is properly
applied
to the creation of an estate -tail, as feoffment is to that of
an estate in fee , and lease to that of an estate for life or
years.
It differs in nothing from a feoffment , but in the
nature of the estate passing by it : for the operative words
of conveyance in this case are do or dedi (c) ; and gifts in
tail
are
equally
imperfect
without
livery
of
seisin ,
as
feoffments in fee -simple (d) .
And this is the only dis-
tinction
that Littleton
seems
to take , when
he
says ( e),
"it is to be understood that there is feoffor and
feoffee ,
donor
and
donee ,
lessor
and
lessee
; "
viz.
feoffor
is
applied
to a feoffment in fee -simple , donor to a gift
in
tail, and lessor to a lease for life , or for years, or at will.
3. We
come next to the third ,
and
now, since
the
recent
amendments , by far the most
important
of
all
assurances-grants

hereditaments
and
estates
in reversion
and
remainder ,
as they were incapable of being
corporally delivered (ƒ) ,
could only be conveyed by grant, and were therefore said
to
lie
in
grant
(g
).
But
before the
recent act
,
a
grant
was inapplicable
to
convey the immediate
freehold
,
which
did not lie
in
grant
.
This
has
been
altered
,
and
an
immediate estate now lies
in
grant
as
well
as
in
livery
(½
).
From this circumstance the conveyance
of
any estate
of
freehold
,
whether
in
possession
or
reversion
,
when
it
is
made
to
a
stranger
to
the title
,
is
always made by grant
;
and the estate passes by the delivering
of
the deed
.
The
words were concedi
et
concessi
,
and the proper phrase
is
now
"
grant
."
The mode
in
which grants
are
modelled
so
as
to
operate under the statute
of
uses
,
will presently appear
.
In this place we may very shortly notice that
,
by virtue
of divers modern acts
of
parliament
passed for the purpose
of meeting the difficulties
in
conveying
land when there
is
some personal incapacity
on
the part
of
the alienor
,
and
yet
a
paramount necessity exists for
conveyance
,
deeds
of
various kinds are authorised
to
be executed
which operate
in
a
wholly
abnormal
way
.
Thus
,
where land
is
pur-
chased for
a
railway
,
and
it
is
impossible
,
either by reason
of incapacity
or
otherwise
,
that an ordinary
conveyance
can be made
,
a
person having only
a
limited
interest may
convey the inheritance
;
or
even
a
deed poll
executed by
the company itself
in
a
form prescribed by the act
,
will
,
if
all preliminaries
which
are necessary
for the protection
of those interested
in
the land
,
have been
duly observed

have the effect of vesting the land in the
company (¿).
Again, in other cases , where a similar
necessity for a con-
veyance
exists ,
and
a similar
difficulty in
finding
a
grantor , the court of chancery may appoint
a person to
convey, and his deed will operate even though he has no
estate whatever in the land (k).
4. A lease is properly
a conveyance of
any lands
or
tenements
(usually
in
consideration
of rent
or
other
annual
recompense), made for life, for years, or at will ,
but
always for a less
time
than the
lessor
has in the
premises
for if it be for the whole interest , it is more pro-
Underlease perly an assignment than a lease (7) .
Though no formal
whole term words
are requisite
to a lease at
common
law ( m) , the
lessor is in
usual words of operation in it are, " demise , grant , and to
assignment. farm let ; dimisi , concessi , et ad firmam
tradidi."
Farm,
or feorme, is
an
old
Saxon
word ,
signifying
provi-
sions (n)
and it
came to be
used
instead
of rent
or
render , because
anciently , the greater part of rents were
reserved in provisions
; in corn , in poultry , and the like :
till the use of money became more frequent .
So that a
farmer , firmarius, was one who held his lands upon pay-
ment of a rent or feorme : though
at present , by a gradual
departure
from the
original
sense , the
word
farm
is
brought
to signify the very estate
or lands
so held upon
farm or rent.
By this conveyance an estate for life , for
years, or at will, may be created ,
either in corporeal
or
incorporeal hereditaments ; though
livery of seisin is in-
deed
incident
and was necessary to one species of leases ,
viz .
leases for life of corporeal
hereditaments
; but to no
other.
Before
the
Statute
of Frauds
a lease for any
number of years might have been made by parol without
writing, entry

That statute (0) rendered
a lease for any period
greater than three years (and even
less if the rent reserved
did not amount to two -thirds of the full value) void
as
a lease, and only operative
as creating an estate at will ,
unless put into writing and signed .

not to be necessarily
made by deed until the
recent
act, already often

it necessary that all leases
previously
required
to be in
writing shall be made by deed (p) .
Much litigation has
taken
place
to determine
whether
a particular
instru-
ment was a lease or merely an agreement for a lease , and
it is said that formerly
the judges endeavoured to construe
them as leases
and not agreements (q).
Since
the latter
act the
tendency is the other way , and a document void
as a lease , from not being under seal , may be , and often is,
construed as an agreement for a lease and enforceable as
such (r).

Whatever
restriction , by the severity of the feudal law, who may
might in times
of very high antiquity
be observed with
regard to leases , yet by the
common law, as it has stood.
for many centuries , all persons seised of any estate might
let
leases
to endure
so long as their
own interest
lasted ,
but no longer .
Therefore
tenant in fee -simple might let
leases of any duration
; for he has the whole interest : but
tenant in tail ,
or tenant for life , could
make
no
leases
which should
bind the issue in tail or reversioner , a lease
enduring
beyond
the tenant's own life being voidable by
the issue ( 8) ; nor
could
a husband ,
seised jure uxoris ,
make a firm or valid
lease
for any longer
term than the
joint lives of himself and his wife , for then his interest

1. The

2. It must

3. If there be any old

a year of expiring .
4. It must be either for
twenty -one years , or three lives ; and not for both .
5. It

the common law, as the lessor cannot resort to them to

7. It must be of lands and tenements most

been let for above half the time (or eleven years out of the
twenty) either for life , for

College
leases.
There was yet another restriction with regard to college
leases , by statute
18 Eliz . c.
6 , which directs , that
one-
third of the old rent , then paid , should for the future be
reserved in wheat
or malt, reserving
a quarter of wheat
for each 6s . 8d., or a quarter of malt for every 58.;
or that
the lessees
should
pay for the same according to the price
that wheat
and malt should
be
sold for , in the market
next adjoining
to the respective
colleges , on the
market
day before the rent becomes
due.
This is said (ƒ) to have
been
an
invention
of lord
treasurer
Burleigh
and
sir
Thomas
Smith ,
then principal secretary of state ; who ,
observing how greatly the value of money had sunk, and
the price of all provisions
risen , by the quantity of bullion
imported
from the new-found
Indies,
(which effects were
likely to increase to a greater degree ) devised this method
for upholding
the
revenues of colleges .
Their
foresight
and penetration
has in thisrespect
been very apparent :
for, though the rent
so reserved in corn was at first but
one-third of the old rent , or half of what was still reserved
in money , yet now the proportion
is nearly inverted ;
and
the money arising
from corn rents
is , communibus
annis ,
almost double of the rents
reserved in money .
But
as
the two rents together have never amounted to the value
of the land , fines for renewal
continued to be demanded
and paid.
The leases of beneficed
clergymen were farther restrained
in case of their non-residence by statute
13 Eliz . c. 20 ,
extended by the
acts already
noticed ,
14 Eliz . c.
11 , 18
Eliz . c. 11 , and 43 Eliz . c. 9.
But these provisions having
been repealed (g) , we need not further notice them .
We come now to the more modern acts , and it is neces-
sary to point out that in these the
legislature
has sepa-

rately dealt with those corporations , which
have an eccle-
siastical , those which
have a collegiate , and those which
have a purely eleemosynary character .
We have already
had occasion to notice the power given to tenants in tail
and tenants for life, and
need
not here further
enlarge
upon the modern acts in regard to them (h).
First, then , as to
ecclesiastical
corporations .
By an
act passed in the year 1836
( ) it was enacted
that thence-
forward , no archbishop , bishop , ecclesiastical
corporation ,
sole or aggregate , canon or prebendary , or other spiritual
person , nor any master or guardian of any hospital , should
renew a lease which should
have
been previously granted
for life , until one or more of the lives named in the pre-
vious lease should have expired ; and then
only
so that
the surviving life or lives with the new lives or life should
make up the number not exceeding three in the whole , for
which the previous
lease
had been granted .
And where
the previous
lease had
been
for forty years , then no re-
newal should be granted till fourteen years had expired ;
with similar restrictions
in
other
cases .
Another and
the last
restraining
act which we may notice
is
a very
recent
one
(k) , prohibiting prebendaries of prebends (not
being prebends of a cathedral or college church ) , rectors ,
vicars and
incumbents
from granting by copy of court
roll or lease in consideration of a fine , all vested
rights at
the date of the act (1) being
preserved .
The act declares ,
however , that
the
same lands
may
be leased,
sold , ex-
changed , or enfranchised
under the provisions of two acts
passed in the year 1842 , to which we now come , and which
are important
enabling
acts .
The first of these (m ) concerns incumbents of benefices

only .
Under this act, incumbents of benefices, with the
consent of the patron and the bishop (and , in the case of
copyholds , of the lord of the manor ) may grant agricultural
leases of their glebe lands for fourteen years ; the act pro-
vides in detail the term of the leases , which are such as a
prudent owner , having full regard to the future as well as
the present , would insert ;
but the parsonage house , and
offices , and ten
acres of glebe most
conveniently
situated
for occupation , are excepted from the authority
given by
the act.
By the other act of the same year (n) , power
is given
to ecclesiastical
corporations , aggregate
or sole,
(except
colleges and some
other
corporations
there
mentioned ,
and except ecclesiastical hospitals ,) to grant building and
mining leases , the terms of which
are prescribed
by the
act.
Other suitable provisions in connection with building
leases , such as power to lay out streets, are also conferred.
The improved values of the property which arise from the
operation of the act after the next
vacancy , are reserved
to be dealt with by the
ecclesiastical
commissioners (o).
The authority given by the act
does not extend to lease
the
palace of an archbishop
or bishop , or the house of
residence of any other corporation , or the gardens , or out-
buildings
adjoining
(p) .
The act is expressly declared to
be an enabling
and not a restraining
act , and
therefore
does not abridge any powers which might in any manner
be in existence previously (9).

GENERALLY,

as to the granting
leases
and otherwise in respect of the
management of their lands , by the universities
of Oxford
and Cambridge
and Durham, and
the
colleges therein ,
and
the colleges at Winchester
and Eton ; also for pro-
viding compensation for the loss of the fines .
The details
of these
acts
are in accordance with
all other modern
enabling
acts ,
and
do
not
require
particular
mention

milly's Act .
Trusts Act .
Lastly , as to charitable
corporations generally . The pro-
visions
of sir
Samuel
Romilly's
act (s) , although
framed
sir
S.
Ro-
apparently
for very different
purposes
,
have been made
use
of
for the
purpose
of
obtaining
the sanction
of
the
court of chancery
to
leases
and other dealings by charitable
corporations
(t).
But the recent acts
(u),
under which the Charitable
charity commissioners
exercise their jurisdiction contain
provisions
for the sanction
by
them
of
every proper dealing
with the
charitable
property
;
and
,
further
,
for carrying
the same into
effect
under
the direction of the commis-
sioners
.
The jurisdiction
of
the
commissioners
under
these acts applies
to
endowed charities only
,
and
it
has been
held
that
charities
whose funds
consist
merely of the
savings
of
voluntary
contributions
are not endowed
(v).
Other charities
,
however
,
may voluntarily
put themselves
under the control
of
the
commissioners
,
and by
so
doing
obtain the advantage
of
the powers given by the acts
.
The
general
result
of
these modern
acts
relating
to
ecclesiastical
,
collegiate
,
and
eleemosynary
corporations
,
is,
that
the restrictions
imposed by the older
acts
have
not been repealed
,
yet provision has been made for meet-
ing all difficulties
in
the prudent management
of
property
arising
from such restrictions
,
whilst the restrictions
still
apply
to
prevent
any improvident
dealing with the pro-

5. An
exchange
is
a
mutual
grant
of
equal
inte-
rests, the
one in
consideration
of the other .
The
word
exchange " is so individually requisite and appropriated
by law to this
case , that it cannot be supplied
by any
other word or expressed by any circumlocution
(y) .
The
estates
exchanged must be equal in quantity
( ≈) ; not of
value , for that
is immaterial , but of interest ;
as
fee-
simple
for
fee -simple , a lease for years for a lease
for
years, but it matters
not whether
the terms be equal in
duration
or not (a ) , and the like.
And the exchange may
be of things
that lie either in grant or in livery ( 6) .
But
no livery of seisin , even in exchanges of freehold , is neces-
sary to perfect the
conveyance
(c) : for
each party
stands
in the place of the other and occupies his right , and
each
of them has
already had corporal
possession of his
own
land .
But entry
must
be made
on both
sides : for , if
either
party die before entry , the exchange is void , for
want of sufficient
notoriety (d) ; also, by the
Statute of
Frauds , writing is made essential to an exchange , and if
one or both things
lie
in
grant
a
deed
is
necessary
(e).

which were taken by him in exchange , through
defect
of
the other's title, he could return back to the possession of
his own .
This effect of an exchange and that of a similar
doctrine in
cases of partition
were abolished'(g) by the
legislature
declaring
that
an exchange or partition
shall
not imply any condition at law.

coparceners
, or tenants in common ,
agree
to divide the
lands
so
held
among them in severalty , each
taking a
distinct
part (h).
Here ,
as in
some
instances
there is
a unity of interest , and in all a unity of possession , it
is
necessary that they all mutually
convey and
assure
to each other the several estates , which they
are to take
and enjoy separately .
By the common law coparceners
and
tenants in
common might have made it by parol
with livery of
seisin (i) ;
joint
tenants ,
being
already
seised
of the whole ,
could
only
testify
a
partition by
deed (k).
The
Statute
of Frauds
made writing neces-
sary, and a deed
is now under
the
recent act essential
in
every
case ().
The
partition
between joint -tenants
is technically
effected
by release , in other
cases by con-
veyance carrying
livery of seisin (m) .
But exchanges
are
now invariably effected , not by any
technical
common
law assurances but by simple
conveyances by grant , as if
made
upon
mutual
sales :
and
partitions
are
usually
effected
by a conveyance to a grantee , to such
uses
as
will vest the
several
parts in the grantors
respectively
in severalty .
We may remember that the legislature
has made pro-
vision
for the

between owners of lands
intermixed
in common

has been made for carry-
ing out the mutual
conveyance where by reason of the
disabilities
or limited
interest of some
or one of the par-
ties, without
such authority , the conveyance could not be
made.
And a subsequent
act (0) contains
corresponding
provisions
for
separate
inclosure of such common fields ;
and under the Commons Inclosure
Act (p) an order of the
commissioners for the
exchange of lands
not subject to
be inclosed
under
the act may
be obtained ,
the
effect
of which
is to confer
a good title to
each
person inte-
rested . A copy of the order then becomes the title deed ,
and the land received
under it remains
to the same uses
and trusts
as those to which the
land
given in exchange
stood limited previously .
These are the several species of primary
or original con-
veyances.
Those which remain
are of the
secondary
or
derivative sort ; which presuppose some other conveyance
precedent , and
only
serve
to
enlarge , confirm , alter , re-
strain , restore , or transfer
the

granted by such
original conveyance.

And in these
cases
there must be a privity of estate between the relessor and

end to the

had enfeoffed one of
the disseisors in fee (a).
8. A
confirmation
is of a
nature
nearly
allied
to
a
release .
Sir Edward
Coke
defines
it (b) to be a convey-
ance of an
estate
or right in
esse ,
whereby
a voidable
estate is made sure and unavoidable , or whereby a parti-
cular
estate is increased : and the words of making it are
these, " give , grant , ratify, approve , and confirm ; " but no
special words are requisite , and indeed no words at all for
conduct , such as receipt of rent by the reversioner
under
a voidable lease is sometimes
sufficient (c).
An instance
of the first branch of the definition
is, if tenant for life or
in tail lease for forty years, and die during
that term ;
here the lease for years is voidable by him in reversion
:
yet , if he hath confirmed the estate of the lessee for years ,
before the death of tenant for life, it is no longer voidable
but
sure (d) .
The
latter
branch , or that which
tends
to
the
increase
of
a
particular
estate is the same in all
respects , with that
species
of release, which operates by
way of enlargement .
9. A surrender , sursumredditio , or rendering
up , is of a
nature directly
opposite to a release
; for, as that operates
by the greater
estate's descending
upon the less , a sur-
render is the falling of a less estate into a greater .
It is
defined (e), a yielding up of an estate for life or years to
him
that
has
the
immediate
reversion
or
remainder ,
wherein
the
particular
estate
may merge
or drown , by
mutual agreement between them .
It is usually done by
these words , " surrender , grant , and yield
up ,"
though
no special form of words is essential (f) .
It must by
the Statute of Frauds be in writing , and under
the re-
cent act, if it be not a surrender of a copyhold
or of an
interest
which
might by law be created without writing,

that the sur-

at least , imme-

In a surrender
there can be no occasion for livery of
seisin (m) ;
for there is
a privity of estate
between the
surrenderor , and the surrenderee ;
the
one's
particular
estate, and the other's
remainder
are one and the
same
estate ; and livery having
been once made at the creation
of it, no
necessity
can
exist
for having
it afterwards .
And , for the same reason , no livery ever was required on
a release or confirmation
in fee to tenant for years or at
will , though
a freehold
thereby passes
: since the rever-
sion of the relessor , or confirmor , and the particular
estate
of the relessee , or confirmee , are one and the same
estate ;
and where
there
is
already
a possession, derived
from
such a privity of estate , any farther delivery of possession
would be vain
and nugatory (n).
We may here notice
that surrenders are sometimes implied by law, though no Implied
actual deed of surrender has
been
made.
Thus , a lessee
accepting
a new
lease , the existence of which
is incom-
patible with the continuance of his former lease , operates
by implication as a surrender of the former lease (o) , and
when the
purpose for which a term of years has been Satisfied
created is satisfied the term itself ceases to exist (p).

10. Assign-
ment.
10. An assignment
is properly
a transfer , or making
over to another , of the right one has in any estate ; but
it is usually applied to an estate
for life or years.
And it
differs from
a lease only in this : that by a lease
one
grants an interest less than his own , reserving to himself
a reversion ; in assignments he parts with the whole pro-
perty , and the
assignee stands in the place of the as-
signor .
The assignee
, however , does not take upon him all
the responsibilities
of the assignor ; he is only bound by
such covenants
as
concern the land and run with it , and
his liability
as to these extends
only to
acts
or defaults
during the period that he himself is in possession of the
term (q).
Whereas the original lessee , whose covenants
extend over the whole
period of the demise , is liable
to
the lessor or covenanter for the acts and defaults , not only
of himself,
but
his
assign
also ,
though
entitled
to an
indemnity
from the latter ( ) .
Formerly the
law did
not
permit
a man to
convey
directly to himself in any manner , even to himself jointly
with others (s).
This rule has , by the aid of the Statute
of Uses (of which more presently ) , has long been evaded
as regards freehold interests .
But since that
statute did
not apply to personal interests , such
as estates
for years,
it was
necessary when
such a conveyance was
desired
(which often happens on a change of trustees )
to
execute
two deeds .
To obviate this , a provision
has been made by
a recent act ,
and now
any person may assign
personal
property , including
chattels real , directly
to himself and
another person or persons , or corporations (t) .

cannot
be
defeated
at
law by writing
unsealed (x) ,
although
such
an
agreement
might
be
enforced
in
equity (y) , and if executed
might even operate at law as
an accord and
satisfaction , satisfying , not defeating , the
obligation
(~).
Before
explaining
the
operation
of the
conveyances
,
which remain to be noticed , and completing
our
account
of those already mentioned , we must
here digress
some-
what to mention
the doctrine of uses , to which we have
many
times alluded (a) , how it became engrafted
upon
the
common
law, and
how it was
transferred
by
the
legislature .
Uses
and trusts , which
are names meaning
the
same
thing, though now used on somewhat
different
occasions
,
are in their
nature
not unlike the fidei
commissum
of
Roman law ( ).
The
notion
of one man
having
the legal
tenancy , or
being the terre tenant , yet bound in conscience to dispose
of the land according
to the wishes of another , was un-
questionably adopted in England from the civil law.
The
mode in which this conscientious
obligation
was
enforced
by the aid of the ecclesiastical
chancellors will
be dealt
with hereafter , and
need
not here be enlarged upon . It
is common to ascribe the introduction
of the
system to
the
ingenious
selfishness of ecclesiastics ,
as
a means of
evading
the
mortmain
law, and also of facilitating
the
devise of land to themselves by dying
penitents .
Cer-
tainly , among
the
earliest
doctrines
established , is the
rule
that
though
lands , of which
a testator was
seised ,
were not in those early times
devisable ; yet, if he
had
conveyed them
to a trustee , and retained only the use of
them , the beneficial interest
so retained might be devised

by will, and the trustee would
be compelled
to hold the
land in trust, not for the heir of the
testator , but the
devisee.
Whatever
may have been the leading motive of
those who originally introduced
the
system of uses
and
trusts , it was adopted with considerable readiness by all .
For , besides the power of disposing of the land by will ,
which it afforded , other technical doctrines of tenure were
disregarded , an important
instance of which was, that
a
trust should
not
be forfeited for treason or felony (c) , a
doctrine which might
be expected to find great favour in
the times of the Wars of the
Roses , when alterations
of
the fortunes of the ruling powers , and consequent accu-
sations of treason against the unsuccessful , were frequent .
This
doctrine ,
however , was
interfered
with
by the
legislature (d) ; but whether , even now , a trust is forfeit-
able for treason (though
the
better
opinion
is that by
virtue of 33 Hen. 8 , c . 20 , it is so) , yet is not beyond the
possibility of doubt .
For these and other reasons of a like character , about
the reign of Edw . IV. , (before whose time , lord Bacon re-
marks (e), there are not six cases
to be found
relating to
the doctrine of uses ) , the courts of equity began to reduce
them to something of a regular system .
uses.
Originally it was held that the chancery could give no Doctrine of
relief, but
against
the very person himself intrusted
for
cestuy que use, and not against
his heir or alienee .
This
was altered in the reign of Henry VI. , with respect to the
heir (f) ; and afterwards the same rule , by a parity of rea-
son , was extended to such alienees as had purchased either
without a valuable consideration , or with an express notice
of the use (g).
But a purchaser for a valuable considera-

tion , without notice , might hold the land discharged of
any trust or confidence .
And also it was held , that neither
the king or queen , on account of their
dignity royal (¹) ,
nor any corporation
aggregate , on account of its limited
capacity () , could be seised to any use but their own ; that
is, they might hold the lands , but were not compellable to
execute the trust.
And , if the feoffee to uses died with-
out heir , or committed
a forfeiture
or married , neither the
lord who entered for his escheat or forfeiture , nor the hus-
band who retained the possession as tenant by the curtesy ,
nor the wife to whom dower was assigned , were liable
to
perform the use ( ) : because
they were not parties
to the
trust, but came in by act of law ; though
doubtless
their
title in reason was no better than that of the heir.
On the other hand
the use itself, or interest of cestuy
que use , was
learnedly refined
upon with many elaborate
distinctions .
And , 1. It was held
that nothing
could be
granted to a use, whereof
the use is inseparable
from the
possession
as annuities , commons , and easements, que
ipso usu consumuntur (k) : or whereof the seisin could not
be instantly
given (7) .
2. A use could not be raised with-
out a sufficient consideration .
For where a man
makes
a
feoffment
to another , without any consideration ,
equity
presumes that he meant it to the use of himself (m) , un-
less he expressly declares it to be to the use of another,
and then
nothing
shall be presumed
contrary to his own
expressions (n).
But , if either a good or a valuable
con-
sideration
appears , equity will immediately
raise
a use
correspondent
to
such consideration (o).
3. Uses
were
descendible according to the rules of the common
law , in

many other respects aequitas sequitur

establish
a different rule of property from that which
the
law
has
established .
4.
Uses
might be
assigned
by
secret deeds between the parties (g) , or be devised by last
will and testament (r) ; for , as the legal estate in the soil
was not
transferred
by these transactions
, no livery of
seisin was necessary ; and , as the intention of the parties
was the leading principle
in this species
of property , any
instrument
declaring
that intention
was
allowed
to be
binding in equity .
But
cestuy que use could not at com-
mon law aliene the legal interest of the lands , without
the
concurrence of his feoffee (s) ; to whom he was accounted
by law to be only tenant
at sufferance (t) .
5.
Uses were Uses not
not liable to any of the feudal burthens
; and particularly
fendal
did
not
escheat
for felony or other defect of blood ; for
escheats, &c. , are the consequence of tenure , and uses are
held
of
nobody (u) ;
but the land itself was
liable
to
escheat , whenever the blood of the feoffee
to uses was ex-
tinguished by crime
or by defect ; and the lord
(as was
before observed ) might hold it discharged
of the use (x) .
6. No wife could be endowed
, or husband have his curtesy ,
of a use (y)
for no trust was declared for their benefit ,
at the original
grant of the
estate .
Though
this was in
early times modified by the court of chancery allowing
a
husband
curtesy out of a use or trust (z).
And therefore
it became customary , when most estates
were put in use ,
to settle before marriage
some joint
estate
to the use of
the husband
and wife for their lives ; which was the origin
of modern jointures (a) .
7. A use could not be extended
by writ of elegit , or other legal
process , for the debts of
cestuy que use (b) .

and
niceties which
the
ingenuity
of the times
(abounding in
subtle disquisitions ) deduced from this child of the ima-
gination , when
once
a departure was permitted
from
the
rules of property established by the ancient law.
These
principal
outlines
will
be fully
sufficient
to
show the
ground of lord Bacon's complaint
(c) , that this course of
proceeding " was turned
to
deceive many
of their just
and reasonable rights .
A man that had
cause
to
sue for
land , knew not against whom to bring his action , or who
was the
owner of it.
The
wife
was
defrauded
of her
thirds ; the husband of his curtesy ; the lord of his wardship ,
relief , heriot , and escheat
; the creditor
of his
extent
for
debt ; and the poor tenant of his lease."
To remedy
these
inconveniences abundance of statutes were provided , which
made the lands liable to be extended by the creditors
of
cestuy que use (d ) ; allowed actions for the freehold
to be
brought against him, if in the actual
pernancy or
enjoy-
ment of the profits ( e) ; made him liable
to
actions
of
waste (f); established his
conveyances
and leases
made
without
the concurrence of his feoffees (9) ; and gave
the
lord the wardship
of his
heir , with certain
other
feodal
perquisites (h).
These provisions all tended to consider cestuy que use as
for trans-
the real owner of the
estate ; and at length that idea was

STATUTE
OF

possession .
The hint seems to have been
derived from
what was done
at the
accession of king
Richard III.;
who , having , when
duke of Gloucester , been
frequently
made a feoffee to uses , would upon the assumption of the
crown (as the law was then understood ) have been entitled
to hold the lands discharged
of the use.
But , to obviate
so notorious an injustice , an act of parliament
was imme-
diately passed (i) , which ordained , that where he had been
so enfeoffed jointly with other
persons , the land should
vest in the other feoffees , as if he had never been named ;
and that , where he stood solely enfeoffed
, the estate itself
should vest in cestuy que use in like manner as he had the
use.
And so the statute of Hen . VIII . , after reciting the
various inconveniences before-mentioned , and many others ,
enacts , that " when any person shall
be seised
of lands ,
&c., to the use, confidence , or trust , of any other person
or body politic , the person or corporation
entitled
to the
use in fee-simple , fee -tail , for life , or years, or otherwise ,
shall from thenceforth stand and be seised or possessed
of
the land , &c. , of and in the like
estates
as they have in
the use, trust , or confidence ; and that the
estate of the
person so seised
to uses shall
be deemed
to be in him or
them that have the use , in such quality , manner , form , and
condition
as
they had
before in the use."
The
statute
thus executes
the use, as our lawyers term it ; that is , it
conveys the possession to the use , and transfers
the
use
into possession ; thereby making
cestuy
que
use complete
owner of the lands
and tenements , as well at law as in
equity .
It will
be remarked
that the word " seised "
being the single word used
in the
statute
(and not pos-
sessed) , excludes from its operation copyholds
and lease-
holds .
Though if a person be seised of a freehold to the
use of another for a term of years , the statute will operate
so as to give the legal term to that other ( ).

Decisions of
The statute having thus not abolished the conveyance to

.
of
common uses
,
but
only annihilated
the
intervening
estate
of
the
feoffee
,
and turned the interest
of
cestuy que usc into
a
legal
instead
of
an equitable ownership
;
the courts
of
common
law began
to
take cognizance
of
uses
,
instead
of
sending
the party
to
seek his relief
in
chancery
.
And
,
considering
them now
as
merely
a
mode
of
conveyance
,
very many
of
the rules
before established
in
equity were adopted with
improvements
by the judges of the
common
law
.
The
same persons
,
however
,
as
before were alone held
capable
of being
seised
to
a
use
.
The same considerations
were
necessary for raising
it
,
and
it
could only
be
raised
of
the
same hereditaments
as
formerly
.
But
as
the statute
,
the
instant
it
was raised
,
converted
it
into an actual possession
of the
land
,
a
great
number
of
the incidents
,
that
for-
merly attended
it
in
its fiduciary
state
,
were now
at
an end
.
The land could not escheat
or
be forfeited
by the
act
or
defect
of
the feoffee
,
nor
be
aliened
to
any purchaser
dis-
charged
of
the use
,
nor
be
liable
to
dower
or
curtesy
,
on
account of the seisin
of
such feoffee
;
because the legal estate
usually
does not rest
in
him for
a
moment
,
but
is
instanta-
neously transferred
to
cestuy que use
as
soon
as
the use
is
declared
.
And
,
as
the use and the land were now con-
vertible
terms
,
they became liable
to
dower
,
curtesy
,
and
escheat
,
in
consequence
of
the seisin
of
cestuy que use
,
who
was now become the terre
-
tenant also
;
and they likewise
were no longer devisable by will
.
Conveyance

strued than
at the com-
inon law
.
The various
necessities of
mankind
induced
also the
strictly con- judges very soon
to
depart from the rigour and simplicity
assurances
of
the rules
of
the common law
,
and to allow
a
more
minute
and
complex
construction
upon
conveyances
to
uses
,
than upon
others
.
Hence
it
was adjudged
,
that
the use need not always be executed the instant
the con-
veyance
is
made
:
but
,
if
it
cannot take effect
at
that time
,
the operation
of
the
statute may wait till the use shall
arise upon
some future
contingency
,
to
happen within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
;
and

ancient use shall remain in the original grantor : as , when
lands are conveyed to the use of A. and B. , after
a mar-
riage shall be had between them ( ), or to the use of A.
and his heirs , till B. shall pay him a sum of money, and
then to the use of B. and his heirs (m) .
Which doctrine , Springing
when
devises by will
were
again
introduced ,
and
con-
sidered as equivalent , in point of construction , to declara-
tions of uses , was also adopted in favour of executory de-
vises (n).
But
much learning
and ingenious
argument
has been devoted to a point concerning
these , which
are
called contingent
or springing
uses , as to whether
there
must be a person seised to such uses at the time when the
contingency
happens (o) .
This question
has been
set at
rest by the legislature
declaring that the future contingent
or executory use (p) shall take
effect
without any con-
tinued
existence
of a seisin to
uses .
Thus , in
both
a
conveyance to uses and in a will a fee may be limited
to
take effect after a fee (q) ; because , though
that was for-
bidden by the common law in favour of the lord's
escheat ,
yet when the legal
estate was not
extended
beyond
one
fee -simple , such subsequent uses
(after a use in fee ) were ,
before the statute , permitted to be limited in equity ; and
then the statute
executed the
legal
estate
in the same.
manner
as the use before subsisted .
It was also held that
a use, though executed , may change from one to another
by circumstances
ex post facto (r) ;
as , if A.
makes
a
feoffment to the
use of his intended wife
and her
eldest
son, for their lives , upon the marriage the wife
takes the
whole use in severalty ; and , upon the birth of a son , the
use is executed jointly in them
both (s) .
This is some- Shifting
times called a secondary , sometimes a shifting use.

whenever the use limited
by the
deed
expires , or
cannot

impossibility, to him who raised it, and is styled
a re-
Resulting
sulting use.
As , if a man makes a feoffment to the use
of his intended wife for life, with remainder
to the use of
her first -born son in tail ; here, till he marries , the
use
results back to himself ; after marriage it is executed in
the wife for life : and , if she dies without
issue, the whole
results
back to him in fee (t) .
A resulting
use of this
kind
is not , however , considered
to confer an estate by
purchase upon the grantor , but is his former estate, and is
so treated for purposes of descent.
It was likewise held ,
that the uses
originally declared may be revoked
at
any
future
time , and new uses be declared of the land , pro-
vided the grantor
reserved to himself such a power at the
creation of the estate ; whereas the utmost that the common
law would allow was a deed of defeazance
coeval with the
grant itself, (and , therefore , esteemed
a part of it, ) upon
events
specifically mentioned (u).
And , in case of such a
revocation , the old uses were held
instantly
to
cease , and
the new ones to become
executed
in their
stead (x) .
And
this was
permitted , partly
to
indulge
the convenience,
and partly the caprice , of mankind
; who (as Lord Bacon
observes (y)) have always affected to have the disposition
of their property , revocable in their own time , and irrevo-

Tyrrell's
case, that
doesnot
executea
use declared
upon a use.
from the
limitation of a farther use to another person is repugnant ,
and , therefore , void (a) .
And , therefore , on a feoffment
to A. and his heirs , to the use of B. and his heirs , in trust
for C. and his heirs , they held that the statute
executed Decision in
only the first use , and that the second was a mere nullity :
the
statuto
not adverting that the instant the first use was executed
in
B.
,
he became
seised
to
the use
of
C.
,
which second use the
statute might
as
well
be
permitted
to
execute
as
it
did the
first
;
and
so
the legal
estate
might be instantaneously
transmitted
down through
a
hundred
uses upon uses
,
till
finally executed
in
the last cestuy que use
.
And this has
been still further
extended
,
by declaring
that
a
feoffment
to
A.
and his heirs
,
to
the use of
A.
and his heirs
,
to
the
use
of
B.
and his heirs
,
has the effect
of
vesting the legal
estate
in
A.
,
and not
in
B.
Even without
the words
"
to
the use of A.
and his heirs
,"
it
was held
,
that
where Use implied
lands were given
to

,
in

to

of

profits

The
result
of
this
is
that the

consider
a

(
either
when

declared
,

)
as

to
the

,
to

the
other
is

By
a
long series
of
uniform

,
and with some
assistance from the legislature
,
they
have raised
a
new system
of
rational
jurisprudence
,
by
which trusts are made
to
answer
in
general all the bene-
ficial ends
of
uses
,
without
their
inconvenience
or

.
The trustee
is
considered
as
merely the instrument
of
con-
veyance
,
and can
in
no shape affect the estate
,
unless by
alienation for
a
valuable consideration
to
a
purchaser with-
out notice
of
the trust
(e):
which
,
as
the deeds
commonly

,
and besides cestuy que use

,
is
a
thing that can rarely

But
it
has been
held
,

,
not
to

to
the lord for want

the Statute
the form of
ances.
The only service , as was before observed , to which this
Effect of
statute is now consigned , is in giving efficacy to certain of Useson
new and special
kinds
of conveyances , and in enlarging
convey-
the powers of the older
sorts .
We may take the latter
first, as being according to the present practice the most
important .
It will be remembered , that the limitation of estates by
common law assurances was bounded within very narrow
limits , and more particularly the creation of remainders
;
the rules of which are laid down at some length .
By the
aid of the Statute
of Uses we may override every one of
these rules to such extent as may be desired , subject only
to the paramount
rule
against
perpetuities .
Thus , the
rule that an estate
may not be limited in defeasance
of, or
in remainder for, a fee simple , is at
once
annihilated
by
a limitation
under
the
statute , such
as the following :
A. enfeoffs , or makes
a grant to , B. and his heirs , to the
use of A.
and his heirs , until
the marriage
of A. , and
afterwards to the use of A. for life , remainder to the use
of the first son of A. and
his
heirs
male , with other
remainder
over.
Here the fee
simple , first limited
to A. ,
is made to cease
entirely
and
a new series of limitations
to spring up upon a given
event happening-that of A.'s
marriage .
Limitations of this sort , effected
in this way ,
are of daily occurrence , with great
varieties
of detail ,
which cannot , and need
not , here be dwelt
upon .
They
would
be
wholly
inadmissible
at
common law.
Two
points
deserve
special notice : first , that by these means
a man
may ,
as in the
instance
just
given ,
convey to
himself ; and , secondly , a power of dealing with the estate
by a future instrument
may be reserved .
Thus , there may
be inserted
at any point in the
series of limitations

When A., then , at

end to the subsequent limitations ; and the original deed
must afterwards
be construed
as if the limitations
con-
tained in A.'s
deed of appointment
were substituted
in
place of
all
the subsequent limitations
.
This method
of
giving powers
of
appointment
is
found
most
convenient
in
practice
,
and may be made subject
to
a
great variety
of
restrictions
,

perpetuities , already (0) referred to, as governing
devises .
The limitations
must be such that they must of necessity
take effect within the duration of a life , or lives , in being
at the date of the deed , or within twenty -one years after-
wards , together with a further period for gestation , in case
it exists , and when the infant to be born is the person
taking a benefit under the
deed . If the
limitations
are
such that it is possible that they may transgress this rule ,
they are absolutely
void , as if they did not exist , and all
subsequent
limitations
fall with them ( p ) , whatever may
prove to be the actual event.
We have only to add , that
the limitations which
may be contained
in the appoint-
ment under a power must
also be kept within the same
confines as to time ; they
must
be such
as , if they had
been actually
inserted
in the
deed
creating
the
power ,
would
have been within the period
assigned by the rule .
The only exception
to this rule
seems to be, where
the
bad
limitation
immediately
succeeds
an
estate
tail ,
or
is in defeazance
of an estate
tail ; since the estate tail may
be converted into
a fee
simple , and as by so doing the
subsequent limitations
may be destroyed , their remoteness
will not be considered as invalidating
them (q) .
The
conveyances
which
remain
to be noticed will not
detain us long .
They were invented principally to obviate
the necessity of a public feoffment and livery of seisin upon
the land.
This necessity no longer
exists , since a grant
is rendered sufficient , even for hereditaments which lie in
livery ; the assurances
, therefore , which we refer to are now
no longer wanted , and being
somewhat artificial
in their
character , have fallen into disuse .

tail, or in fee(r).
Here , the statute executes
at once the
estate ; for the
party
intended to be benefited , having
thus acquired the use , is thereby put at once into corporal
possession of the land (s) , without ever seeing it, by a kind
of parliamentary
magic .
But this
conveyance can only
operate , when
made upon
such weighty
and interesting
considerations
as those of blood or marriage .
Yet a deed
may operate as a covenant to stand
seised , although not
one in form
or language (t).
This mode of conveyance
, as
well as that to be next noticed , will apply to a remainder
or reversion , as well
as
to
an
estate
in
possession ( ~) ,
though
inasmuch
as " grant " applied
to these , it was
never in common use for such estates .
Another
species of conveyance, introduced by this statute,
is that of a bargain and sale of lands ; which is a kind of
real contract , whereby the
bargainor
for some pecuniary
consideration bargains and sells , that is , contracts
to con-
vey, the land to the bargainee ; and
becomes
by such a
bargain trustee for , or seised
to the use of, the bargainee ;
and then the statute of uses completes the purchase (x) ;
or,
as it has
been well
expressed (y), the bargain
first
vests the use, and then the
statute vests the
possession .
But, as it was foreseen
that conveyances , thus made , would
want all those benefits of notoriety , which
the old com-
mon law assurances were calculated
to give : to prevent
clandestine
conveyances
of
freeholds ,
it
was
enacted
By stat. 27 in the
same
session of parliament , by statute 27 Hen . 8,

and
sales
should
not endure
to

But if
it become void it will be considered to have been void ab
initio (z).
Clandestine
bargains
and
sales of chattel in-
terests ,
or
leases
for
years ,
were
thought
not
worth
regarding ,
as
such
interests
were
very
precarious , till
about six years before ;-which
also occasioned
them to be
overlooked
in framing
the statute of uses ;-and therefore
such bargains and sales are not directed to be enrolled .
A bargain and sale is also the appropriate assurance in
another case not operating
under the statute of uses , but
which
resembles an appointment
under
a power .
It is
where a conveyance is made under a common law authority ,
as where a direction
is given
in a will to sell an estate
without a devise of any estate to the person who is to make
the sale ; or a similar
case , where copyholds
are devised
to such uses
as the testator's
trustees
should
appoint in
order to complete
a
sale .
In such
cases the purchaser
takes by force of the will or other instrument
creating the
power , and not of the deed exercising it.
Executors
have,
under a recent act (a) , power to sell their testator's
land ,
even though not devised
to them , if he have charged it with
his debts .
Their conveyance would in such cases operate
like a bargain
and
sale, vesting
the legal
estate
in the
freeholds , and , in the
case of the
copyholds ,
conferring
the right of admittance .
operating as
release.
The last conveyance which
we have to mention , was Release,
founded
originally upon
the
statute of
uses , but now aleaseand
depends upon
another
statute ; it is
a release
made in
pursuance
of the
act of parliament
intituled , " An act
for rendering a release as effectual for the conveyance of
freehold
estates
as
a lease
and
release
by the same
parties "(b), and till recently was the most common of any
assurances .
Formerly it consisted of a lease and release ,
and
was first
invented
by Serjeant
Moore ,

ALIENATION BY DEED .
the
statute
of
uses.
It was thus contrived : A leasc ,
or rather
bargain
and
sale, upon
some pecuniary
con-
sideration , for
one year, is made
by the tenant of the
freehold to
the
lessee
or bargainee .
Now, this , with-
out any enrolment , made the
bargainor
stand
seised
to
the use of the
bargainee ,
and
vested
in
the
bargainee
the
use of the term for a year ;
and
then
the
statute
of uses immediately
annexes the possession .
No enrol-
ment was required , because the enrolment
act
does
not
apply to leasehold interests .
The
lessee , therefore , being
thus in possession
, was capable of receiving
a release of
the freehold and reversion ; which , we have seen before (c) ,
must be made to a tenant in possession : and , accordingly ,
the next day , a release
was granted to him (d).
This was
held to supply the place of livery of seisin
and so a con-
veyance by lease and
release was said to
amount
to
a
feoffment (e).
This continued to be the common mode of
conveyance till the year
1841 , when the act above named
was
passed , with
the
intention
of making
one deed
do
instead of two.
Since , however , the act which was passed
in the year 1845 , this method of assurance , being obviously
a very artificial
one ,
possessing
no
advantage
over
a
grant, has ceased to be used.
Such
are
the conveyances now in use, or capable of
being used ; but we have yet to explain
a class of deeds
which depend in great measure for the effectuation of their
object upon the provisions of the legislature .
We refer to
disentailing
assurances by tenants in tail, and assurances
by married
women .
We have traced
the history of the
growth of the power over their estates of tenants in tail ,
and already adverted to the fact , that until recently the
only mode of alienation
was by the aid of the court of
common pleas (ƒ) .
This method has been abolished , and
a deed substituted . In order , however , properly to under-

FINES AND
RECOVERIES
.
541
stand
its
effect
,
we must very shortly describe the former
proceedings
,
the nature
of
which has been already alluded
to(g).
The most ancient
of
these
,
though
not till afterwards
applied
to
bar an estate
tail
,
was called
a
fine
,
of
which
there were three sorts
,
called
in
the law French
respec-
tively
,
a
fine
"
sur cognizance
de
droit
come
ceo
que
il
ad
de
son done
;"
a
fine
"
sur cognizance
de
droit tantum
;"
a
fine
"
sur
consessit
;"
and
a
fine
"
sur
done
grant
et
render
."
They differed principally
in
the nature
of
the
right which the deforciant
(
i.e.
,
the person against whom
the mock legal
proceeding was instituted
)
admitted
.
It
is
needless
here
to
enter into their technical
distinctions
:
they were all
of
the same character
,
viz
.,
a
real action
brought
to
a
sudden termination
by an admission
of
title
by the deforciant
,
and
a
compromise made by leave of the
court
.
Their effect was
successively
regulated
by the
statutes

:
under which
,
proclamations
of
the fine were rendered necessary
;
and
if
no persons claimed
in
consequence
,
the validity
of
the fine was established
.
These proclamations
being
in
fact useless
,
were afterwards
declared by statute
to
be
deemed unnecessary
(h).
A
tenant
-
in
-
tail
or
person who was
to
convey the land
by the fine was the defendant
;
the plaintiff being
he
to
whom
the title was
to
be made
.
A
deed
was usually
executed declaring
the
uses
upon which
the person who
so
required title was
to
hold the land
.
The other
species
of
assurance
of
a
similar character
was the common
recovery
,
which
was
a
suit
not
com-
promised
,
but carried
through
all the
processes
.
The
common process
as
finally used was this
.
A.
,
the tenant-
in
-
tail
(
supposing the recovery
to
be
suffered by
a
tenant-
in
-
tail
),
conveyed
a
freehold
interest
to
P.
,
a
mere
nominee
,

reddat .
P. then declared that he had the land from A.,
and vouches him to warranty .
A. thereupon declared that
he had the lands from R. (usually
the cryer of the court),
and he vouches R.
R. then
makes default
in defending
the title, and P. thus
recovers the land : Q. is supposed
to get a recompense from A. the
tenant , and A. is sup-
posed
to get
a recompense
(merely nominal , of
course )
from R. , and so justice is supposed to be done .
Mean-
while ,
however , A.
gets
a declaration
of title
by the
record , which , under the circumstances , is an absolute title.
against all the world .
The
reason for making
a tenant
to the præcipe , as the defendant in the
action , and
not
the tenant -in-tail himself, was that in the former case the
recovery was held to bar
every latent
interest which he
might have in the land , whereas , if it had been against
the tenant -in-tail as defendant , it barred only that estate
in the premises
of which he was then actually
seised (i).
Such is a rough outline of these assurances , absurd enough
in themselves , yet eminently
useful in their
effects .
A
fine was considered as only barring
the issue of a tenant-
in-tail, and not the remainderman , whilst a recovery barred
every estate in remainder or reversion .
The latter , there-
fore, was generally
used, though
the former
(being
less
expensive) was resorted to when
possible : it was
the
invariable
mode
used for
a
conveyance by a
married
woman .
It will be
seen
that ,
as the
action
must be
against the tenant of the freehold
in possession (subject
only to terms
of years (k) ) ,
a tenant -in-tail could
not
suffer a recovery whilst there was a preceding life estate ,
not , in fact , until his estate was in possession .
All this method of dealing with these interests has been
abolished by the legislature (). We can here only shortly
notice the provisions of this most useful act which accom-
plished
this.
The
substance of them may be stated as
follows :

DISENTAILING

assurances.
Every actual tenant - in -tail (including every person who Disentailing
has only a right to be such) may now (m) dispose of the
lands (n) entailed , for an estate in
fee-simple , or any less
estate , or for any limited
purpose (o), or against all persons
claiming
the lands
by virtue
of the entail , and
also
as
against all persons (including the
crown ) whose estates
are to take effect after the determination , or in defeasance
of the estate tail (p).
The deed
by which the disposition
is made must be inrolled in chancery within six calendar
months
after
its execution (9) .
The power is not to be
exercised by any woman tenant -in -tail of lands within the
provisions of 11 Hen.

visione viri), except with such assent as would under that
statute have been necessary to a fine or recovery (r) ; but as
no settlement was to be made in future under the Act of
Hen.
7, this
exception
has now scarcely
any
meaning
except in reference to a few old settlements .
Another
restriction
extends
to
tenants -in-tail
who ,
under
the " act
to
embar
feigned
recovering
of land
wherein
the king
has the
reversion (s)," are restrained
from barring their estates tail ; that is , persons on whom.
lands have been conferred by the crown in tail , as a reward
for public services (t) , also tenants -in -tail after possibility
of issue
extinct
are
restrained
from
converting
their
estate into a fee - simple ( u).
The act specially provides (x)
that issue in tail , having therefrom
merely an expectant
interest , are to have no power to dispose of the lands in
respect of that interest .

a settle-
ment.
We may remember that a tenant -in-tail in remainder
could not , at least without
the concurrence of the tenant
of the freehold
in possession , suffer a recovery , though he
could levy a fine .
An incapacity of a similar character
has been created by the act, which
constitutes , with this
view , a protector of the settlement , as he is termed .
The
Protector of Owner of the first
estate
for years , determinable
on lives ,
or any greater estate prior to the estate tail , is made the
protector (y) ; or the person (if any) who
is appointed
by
the settlor for the purpose .
The protector must , in order
that the disposition
by the tenant -in -tail may be valid
to
bar
remainders
and reversions , give
his
consent
to the
disposition , either by the deed itself, or by a distinct deed
to be executed on or before the day on which the assurance
is made.
And the protector's
consent must
also
be en-
rolled
either at or before the time when the assurance is
inrolled .
Tenant-in-
tail may
createa
basefee
without
consentof
protector.
The
protector is to be
absolutely
free to
determine
whether
he gives
his
consent or not , and is not to be
looked upon in any manner as a trustee in respect of his
power of consenting (~).
If no consent by the protector be given , then the tenant-
in-tail can only create
a base fee , but he may enlarge this
after the estate
has fallen into possession , or sooner , if he
can at any time obtain the protector's consent (a). The dis-
position by a tenant - in -tail must be by deed , and not will ,
and must be a conveyance and not a mere contract ; and
no contract by a tenant -in-tail is to have any effect
either
at law or in equity , even if by deed
; and if the tenant-
in -tail be a married woman , her husband must concur (b).
The act provides for the disposition of the property of a
bankrupt tenant - in -tail for the benefit of his creditors (c) .

It also enacts
that the previous

estates

surance shall be by surrender instead of deed , and the deed

of the act remaining
to be noticed are Convey-
those by which a married woman may dispose of her lands married
or any interest in them .
For fines , which were previously
the method
adopted for this purpose being abolished , it
became necessary to substitute another
process .
The act,
therefore , declares that a married woman
(in every case
except
that of a tenant -in -tail, for which provision
had
already been made) , may , with her husband's concurrence ,
dispose of lands of any tenure , and money , subject
to be
invested
in the purchase of lands , or arising from the sale
of land (9), and also dispose of, release, or extinguish
any
estate which
she may possess
in lands
or such money as

a feme sole, but

exercise are not interfered with by the
act (i).
We have given but a bare outline
of this
statute , but
sufficient for our present
purpose ; we may add that
the
act having been drawn in a masterly manner , has
given
rise to fewer difficulties
in its application
than
usually
occur when
revolutions
are
effected
by parliament .
The
inrolment in
chancery
seems to have been
adopted
as
giving
an additional
solemnity to the
deed
disentailing
the estate , but inasmuch
as its only effect
is to create an
additional
expense , it
is not very
clear why even this
might not be dispensed with.
Before we conclude this chapter , we may with propriety
add
a few remarks
on certain
deeds
which do not, it is
true , affect land
directly , yet which
formerly
had
much ,
and still have some effect upon the title of lands when in the
hands of devisees or heirs , or in other words , which create ,
or may create , what the law calls a specialty debt .
Their
importance , however , is very shortly to
cease .
These are
Bonds and
bonds and
covenants , the nature
of which is the same ,
Covenants.
though the form is usually different .
An obligation
or
bond is a deed whereby the obligor
declares himself, and
usually his heirs , executors , and administrators , bound to
pay a certain sum of money .
The language in which this
is
expressed
is
immaterial ,
so
that the
meaning
be
clear (k).
If this be
all
,
the bond
is
called
a
single
one
,
simplex
obligatio
:
and the bond
is
scarcely distinguishable
from
a
covenant
;
but there
is
generally
a
condition
added
,
that
,
if
the obligor
does some particular
act
,
the obligation
shall
be void
,
or
else shall remain
in
full force
:
as
payment
of
rent
;
performance
of
covenants
in
a
deed
;
or
repayment
of
a
principal
sum
of
money borrowed
of
the obligee
,
with
interest
,
which
principal
sum
is
usually
one
-
half
of
the
penal sum specified
in
the bond
.

not performed , the bond becomes
forfeited , or absolute , at
law, and formerly
the whole amount of the penalty could
be recovered
though equity interposed to prevent the cre-
ditor getting more than the amount of principal , interest ,
and
costs , and
this
now is all that a court of law will
give (1) where the bond is given to secure
a sum of money
and interest ; and if it be given for other purposes , then
only the amount of damages which
a jury will assess
can
be recovered (m ) , and this is limited to the amount of the
penalty .
The condition or defeazance is usually
contained in the
deed or bond itself ; it may , however , be
a separate and
subsequent
deed (n ) .
impossible
condition.
If the condition of a bond be impossible at the time of Effect of an
making it, or be to do a thing contrary to some rule of or illegal
law that is merely positive , or be uncertain , or insensible ,
the
condition
alone
is void , and the bond
shall
stand
single , and unconditional
: for it is the folly of the obligor
to enter into such an obligation , from which he can never
be released . If it be to do a thing that is malum in se,
the obligation
itself is void : for the whole is an unlawful
contract , and the
obligee
shall
take no advantage from
such a transaction .
And if the condition
be possible
at
the time of making it, and afterwards becomes
impossible ,
by the act of
God ,
the
act of law, or the
act of the
obligee
himself,
there the penalty
of the
obligation
is
saved
for no prudence or foresight of the obligor
could
guard against such a contingency (0) .
We
say usually the bond
expressly binds
the
heir
as
well as the executor and administrator .
This was of im-
portance in regard to the remedies which we may remem-
ber the law gave to creditors of a deceased
debtor against
his real
property , which he had not by his will
charged
with ,
or
devised
subject
to,
payment of his
debts (p) .

ALIENATION BY DEED .
For we may remember that the law which first
rendered
such property liable to the payment of all debts
preserved
the preferential
rights of creditors by specialty , in which
the heirs are bound (q)
over
other specialty creditors
and
simple contract creditors .
This priority still exists as regards creditors of persons
who shall have died before the 1st January , 1870.
Credi-
tors by contract of persons who shall die on or after that
day are , by an act of the present year (32 & 33 Vict. c. 46 ) ,
to be treated as of equal degree , except so far as they may
hold any security .
It is therefore
sufficient
to say here ,
that
a bond creditor whose debtor
shall have died
before
the beginning of the year 1870 ranks as a specialty creditor ,
and if the heirs are named in the bond , reaps the conse-
quent
additional
advantage
as
regards his debtor's real
estate , always supposing that the debtor have not provided
by his will for payment of his debts.
We may remark that in bankruptcy
no such distinction
is allowed
or ever was thought
of.
There
the
maxim ,
equality is equity , has always been adopted .
A covenant is a direct agreement by a man on behalf of
himself, his heirs , executors , and
administrators , under
seal, to do such a thing or to pay such
a sum of money,
with or without interest , on such a day .
It is , in fact , a
direct mode of obliging the covenantor by specialty to per-
form the same duty as a bond in an indirect way enforces.
Upon action on a covenant , exactly the same
damages
are
obtained
as
on
a bond , unless
indeed the limit of the
penalty be reached in the latter
case .
All observations
which we have
made
as to bonds
apply to
covenants ,
which were considered to rank as specialty debts .
Covenants in practice invariably
(though not necessarily )
bind the heir expressly .
We have already referred
to cer-
tain covenants often contained in conveyances
of real pro-
perty , which
in
many
cases bind not only the
heir or

By these acts (s) , which in most respects are similar,

not identical , deeds

Some persons have thought
that
the notoriety
of the
title which a registry gives is a matter of great moment
and value , and therefore a scheme
of general registration
should be adopted .
Other very competent judges have had
occasion to doubt whether more disputes have not arisen in
these counties by the inattention
and omissions of parties
than have been prevented by the use of registers .
More-
over , the expense of searching the register , which is neces-
sary on every
dealing
with the land , is no slight disad-
vantage .
The generally prevalent
opinion
seems
to have
been against a system of compulsory registration .

ASSURANCES
by
matter
of record
are
such
as
do
not
entirely depend on the act or consent of the parties them-
selves
but the sanction of a court of record is called in to
substantiate , preserve , and be a perpetual testimony of the
transfer of property from
one man to another ; or of its
establishment , when
already transferred .
Of this nature
are, 1. Private
acts of parliament .
2. The king's grants .
3.
Orders
made by the Court of Chancery under
certain
acts .
Private acts of parliament
are a not uncommon
mode
of assurance.
For it may sometimes happen , that , by the
ingenuity of some, and the blunders of other practitioners ,
an estate is most grievously
entangled by a multitude
of
contingent
remainders , resulting
trusts , springing
uses ,
executory devises, and the like artificial
contrivances ;
so
that it is out of the power of either the courts of law or
equity to relieve the owner . Or it may sometimes happen ,
that, by the strictness or omissions of family settlements,
the tenant of the
estate
is abridged
of some reasonable
power (as, letting leases , making a jointure for a wife , or
the like) , which power cannot be given him by the ordinary
judges
either in common law or equity .
Or, it may be
necessary , in settling
an
estate , to secure it against
the
claims of infants
or other persons under legal disabilities ,
who
are not bound
by any judgments
or decrees of the
ordinary courts of justice .
This practice was carried to a great length in the year
succeeding the restoration ; by setting aside many convey-

ances alleged to have been made by constraint , or in order
to screen the estates from being forfeited during the usur-
pation .
And at last it proceeded
so far , that , as the noble
historian
expresses
it (a) , every man had raised an equity
in his own imagination
, that he thought
was entitled
to
prevail against any descent , testament , or act of law , and
to find relief in parliament
: which
occasioned
the king , at
the close of the
session , to remark (6) , that the good old
rules of law are the best security ; and to wish , that men
might not have too much
cause
to fear , that the settle-
ments which they make of their
estates
shall be too easily
unsettled
when they
are dead, by the
power of parlia-
ment.
Acts of this kind are , however , at present carried on, in
both houses , with great deliberation and caution . Nothing ,
also , is done without
the consent , expressly given , of
all
parties
in
being
,
and capable
of
consent
,
that have the re-
motest interest in the matter
:
unless such consent shall
appear
to
be perversely and without any reason withheld
.
And
an
equivalent
in
money
or
other estate
is
usually settled
upon infants
,
or
persons not
in
esse
,
or
not
of
capacity
to
act for themselves
,
who
are
to
be concluded by this act
.
And
a
general saving
is
constantly
added
,
at
the close
of
the bill
,
of
the right and interest
of
all
persons whatsoever
,
except those whose consent
is
so
given
or
purchased
,
and
who are therein
particularly
named
:
though
it
has
been
held
,
that
,
even
if
such saving
be
omitted
,
the act shall
bind none but the parties
(c).
A
law
,
thus made
,
though
it
binds
all
parties
to
the
bill
,
is
yet looked
upon
rather
as
a
private
conveyance
,
than
as
the solemn act
of

contrary to law and reason (e) ; and
no judge
or jury is
bound to take notice of it, unless the same be specially set
forth and pleaded to them . It remains , however , enrolled
among the public records of the nation , to be for ever pre-
served
as
a perpetual
testimony
of the
conveyance
or
assurance so made or established .
The acts which we have alluded
to in our disquisition
upon leases , and particularly
the Leases and Sales of Set-
tled
Estates Act (f) , have gone far to meet the require-
ments
which
experience
has
pointed
out
as
commonly
occurring in the way we have mentioned ; and private
acts
of parliament
are
therefore now less frequent
than
pre-
viously to that act.
Nevertheless , it is still
sometimes
necessary to resort to the transcendent power of parliament
to cut some Gordian
knot in the title or in the manage-
ment of an estate .
The
king's
grants
are
also matter
of public record.
For , as
St. Germyn
says (g) , the king's excellency is so
high in the law , that no freehold may be given to the king ,
nor derived from him, but by matter of record .
And to
this end a variety of offices
have
been from time to time
erected , communicating
in a regular subordination
one with
another , through which all the king's grants
must
pass ,
and be transcribed , and inrolled
; that the same might be
narrowly
inspected by his officers ; so as to inform him if
any thing contained
therein was improper or unlawful to
be granted (h).
These grants , whether of lands , honours ,
liberties , franchises , or ought
besides , were always
con-
tained in charters , or letters patent , that
is , open
letters ,

they were not sealed up ,

Alienation

Trustee
Acts.
The private
estates of the queen and her
predecessors
have, however , been preserved from the operation of the
acts we have alluded to , and may be disposed of with as
ample a power as if they were the
estates
of subjects (m ) ;
and they are also subject to the like taxes
and
assess-
ments , whether
parliamentary
or parochial ,
as
those of
private persons.
Royal grants , therefore , by letters
patent
apply only
now to a few incorporeal hereditaments , such as dignities ,
offices , and the like.
The manner of making
the grant
has been prescribed by act of parliament (n) .
A warrant ,
addressed to the lord
chancellor , is first prepared by the
attorney or solicitor -general , setting forth the tenor of the
intended letters patent ; it is then signed with the queen's
own sign manual , and countersigned by a principal
secre-
tary of state : it is afterwards
sealed with her
Majesty's
privy seal
the patent then immediately
passes under the
great seal ;
so that the sign manual , thus countersigned ,
is the warrant to the privy seal , and the privy
seal
is the
warrant to the great seal (o).
But there are some grants
which only pass through
certain
offices ,
as
the
ad-
miralty or treasury , in consequence
of
a sign
manual ,
without the
confirmation
of
either
the
great ,
or the
privy seal.
The remaining instance of alienation
by matter of record
need not detain us long ; it is the result of a device of the
legislature in order to overcome certain obstacles which the
ordinary chances of human life present in the management
of trust property . When any lunatic
or person of unsound
mind , or any idiot, is seised
or possessed
of any property ,
or entitled
to any contingent
interest in property , upon
trust or by way of mortgage , the Lord Chancellor
or Lords
Justices of Appeal in Chancery may make an order vesting

the property in such person as he or they may direct (p) ,
and such an order has the same
effect
as if the trustee or
mortgagee had been sane , and had executed
a conveyance
of the property .
Again , where a trustee is an infant or is
out of the jurisdiction , or cannot be found , or when it is
uncertain
which
of several trustees was the survivor , or
whether
the last trustee
is
alive
or
dead ,
or
when
a
trustee has died intestate without
an heir , or the heir or
devisee cannot be found- in any of these cases the Court
of Chancery
may
make
an order vesting
the
property ,
subject to the
trust , in such
person
as the court
may
direct ; and the order has the same effect as if the trustee
or the heir or devisee
had executed a conveyance (q).
Where lands have been directed by a court of equity to
be sold for any purpose whatever (r) , or where the court
has made a decree
for specific performance of a contract
concerning
lands , the person in whom
they may happen
to
be
vested
is
declared
to
be
a trustee
within
the
meaning of the act , and the court can deal with the lands
accordingly , and it may discharge the
contingent
right ,
under the will of any deceased debtor , or of any unborn per-
son (s).
This provision has greatly facilitated
the working
out of the statute which
gives the court power to apply
real estate in payment of the debts of a deceased
debtor .
The
like
order
may
be
made in
cases
where
a mort-
gagee has died without
having
entered
into possession ,
and there is a similar
difficulty
in obtaining

CHAPTER XXIII .
ALIENATION
BY DEVISE .
THE last method of conveying real property is by devise ,
or disposition contained in a man's last will and testament .
And , in considering
this
subject , we will
shortly
inquire
first into the origin
and antiquity
of devising real estates
by will, and then set forth the present law, which wholly
depends
upon
a recent
statute .
We may here remark
that , now , the same rules
govern
the validity of a will in
dealing with real property , as when it comprises personal
property ;
though
the history of the
power of devising
land materially
differs from that of bequeathing personal
chattels , and leasehold interests in land .
devisere-
strained on
tion of fen-
introduc-
dal system.
It seems
sufficiently
clear , that , before the
conquest , Power to
lands
were devisable
by will (a).
But , upon the intro-
duction
of the military tenures , the restraint
of devising
lands
naturally
took
place ,
as
a branch
of the feudal
doctrine
of non-alienation
without
the
consent of the
lord (b) ; though
the feudists were not
the inventors
of
this restriction , as we may trace it even from the ancient
Germans (c) .
And
the
ancient
law of the
Athenians
directed
that the
estate
of the
deceased
should

ALIENATION
BY DEVISE .
by testament , and devise away estates
from the collateral
heir , the result was to produce
an
excess of wealth in
some and corresponding
poverty in others,
and
thence
divers political evils
involving
an overthrow
of liberty .
An argument , founded on the political
effect of limiting
a power of devise , as also the like effect of primogeniture
,
has been used by both sides in the various controversies
that have arisen upon what
ought to be the law on these
points , and modern nations
differ very materially in the
views
adopted by their respective
systems of jurispru-
dence.
We need here only remark , that whatever may be
the political consequences
of a restriction
upon
a man's
power of dealing with his property , it is now too late , in
England, to say that a very considerable
amount of free-
dom in disposition
by will shall not be enjoyed.
Certainly
whilst the law of primogeniture
continues to hold sway
over the devolution
of land , it would
be to the
highest
degree
inexpedient
to interfere with the present extensive
liberty enjoyed by every possessor of property in respect
to its distribution
after his death .
And
experience
does
not show that testators by their wills
often
commit
an
injustice
to members of their family greater
than
that
which , according
to the opinion
of many at least , is in-
volved in this rule of primogeniture .
Moreover , the power
of dealing , within reasonable limits , with his property by
will, is generally
esteemed
to be , and doubtless is , a great
incentive
to a man
to
be
energetic , and
at the
time.
prudent , during the active
period
of his life .
In
the
feudal times , many influences
operated upon men wholly
different
from
those which
in the
present peaceful
and
commercial
state of society are
of primary
importance ;
and, accordingly , we find
that , by the
common
law of
England since the conquest , no estate , greater than for a
term of years , could be disposed of by testament (e) ; ex-
cept only in Kent , and in some ancient burghs , and a few

particular
manors , where their
Saxon
immunities
by spe-
cial
indulgence
subsisted (f).
And though
the feudal
restraint
on alienations
by deed
vanished very early , yet
this on wills continued for some centuries
after : from an
apprehension of infirmity and imposition
on the
testator
in extremis, which made such devises
suspicious (g) .
Be-
sides , in devises
there was wanting
that general notoriety ,
and public designation of the successor
, which in descents
is apparent to the neighbourhood , and which the simplicity
of the common law always required in every transfer
and
new acquisition
of property .
the use.
But when ecclesiastical ingenuity
had invented the doc- Devise of
trine of uses as a thing distinct
from the land , uses began
to be devised very frequently (h) ,
and the
devisee
of the
use could in chancery compel its execution .
For it is ob-
served
by Gilbert (?) , that ,
as
the popish
clergy
then
generally
sate in the
court of chancery , they considered
that men are most liberal when they can enjoy their
pos-
sessions no longer : and therefore
at their
death would
choose to dispose of them to those, who , according to the
superstition
of the times , could intercede for their happi-
ness in another world .
After the statute of uses (j) had
annexed
the
possession to the use, these
uses , being the
very land itself,
became
no
longer
devisable ,
at least
without some
special
conveyancing
machinery
fitted
to
the
purpose, such
as
a conveyance to such
uses
as the
owner might by will appoint , a thing which would obvi-
ously be rare in practice .
This might have occasioned a
great revolution in the law of devises, had not the statute
of wills been made
about five years
after , viz ., 32 Hen. Statute of

Corporations were excepted in these statutes , to prevent

enough has
already been said.
We may remark , that though
a married
woman
was
expressly excepted from those who were enabled by the
act to devise lands , yet this exception was held not to
extend to prevent her dealing with lands which were set-
tled to such uses
as she might appoint .
It has been long
established that she may exercise
power of appointment (k) .
Her present capacity to make a will stands upon a similar
footing , for no addition to it was made by the recent act (1).
The principal enlargement
of her
powers which
she has
gained is due to the establishment upon settled principles
of the equitable
doctrine of a married woman's
separate
estate.
The recent
cases (m) seem to show that she may
now alienate by will , without the special machinery of a
power of appointment , even a fee simple of lands , if settled
to her separate use.

Whether, however ,

still
affects

continue
much
longer
seems doubtful (p).

These, therefore , con- the

.
tinued
to
be
in
the same position
as
personal property
;
and the next statute which
dealt with
the
subject
of
de-
vises
made the
same
omission
.
That statute
was the
famous act passed with
a
view
,
amongst
other things
,
of
disposing
of
the
countless difficulties
which
arose
in
de-
termining
whether wills had been really executed
as
they
were
alleged to have been
;
difficulties
like those which
attended
disputes
upon verbal contracts
,
which were also
dealt with by the act
.
The Statute
of
Frauds
(9)
directed
that all devises
of
lands and tenements should not only be
in
writing
,
but should be signed by the testator
or
some
person
in
his presence and by his direction
,
and
be
sub-
scribed by three witnesses
at
least
.
The statute did not
,
however
,
require any such solemnity
for the validity
of
a
will
of
personal
estates
,
which
continued
to
be perfectly
good
,
even though made without
the presence
of
a
single
witness
.
This statute
,
notwithstanding
the anxiety
of
the legis-
lature
,
by
no
means
put
an
end
to
the questions which
arose
.
One
of
these
,
relating
to
the
competency
of
the
witnesses
,
was met by another
attempt
at
legislation
(r).
Another
,
of
a
different
kind
,
involving
the
frequent
disappointment
of
the intention
of
testators
,
arose
by
reason of the rule
,
which was held
,
that all devises
under
the
statute
must
be considered
to
be specific

ALIENATION BY
DEVISE .
Law asto
wills made
general the terms of the will might be ; or, which is much
the same thing , that a will could only
operate
upon
such
land as the testator possessed
at the
date of making his
will.
If, therefore , he acquired lands subsequently , these
could not pass by the will (s) ; nay , more , if he altered his
estate in those which he possessed at the date of the will,
it was considered to be a revocation
of the will as far
as
concerned
such lands (t) .
Unless , indeed ,
subsequently
to the acquisition
of, or change of ownership of the lands ,
he republished the will ( u).
For many reasons, then , the legislature
was again
led
since 1837. to interfere .
And now the validity, and in many respects
the construction , of all wills made, re- executed
, or repub-
lished on or after the 1st January , 1838, depend upon
a
recent act (x) , which repealed all former
acts (y) .
To this
we will now turn our attention .
In the first place the act
greatly enlarges
the subject
matter
over which
a
testa-
mentary power
exists .
For previously
there were
some
things
which
could
not be devised at all , such as a right
of entry upon condition , and most contingent
estates
and
possibilities , also estates pur
autre vie in copyholds where
there was no special
occupant .
All these,
and
indeed
every species
of property and estate in
its
nature capable
of
being dealt with by will
,
are made devisable
,
with the
single
exception
,
indeed
,
of
estate tail
,
the barring
of
which
being
,
as
we have
already fully shown
,
only per-
mitted
in
a
particular
way
,
cannot
be
effected by will
,
and
therefore
,
a
will
does
not
operate upon
it
.
Moreover
,
it
was formerly
necessary
in
most manors
,
in
order that the
tenant
of
copyhold tenements might dispose of them by

will , that he should
surrender them into the hands of the
lord , to such uses as he should appoint by will.
The
ne-
cessity of this
surrender
had been to some extent
done
away with by a previous
act (~) , the provisions
of which
are re-enacted
in an improved form , and now no surrender
to the uses of a will is necessary.
Again , the act de-
clares that every will shall
take effect as if it had
been
made immediately before the testator's death , except where
the language
in any part
plainly requires
another
con-
struction (a).
A will , therefore , may now deal with after-
acquired property , and the unlooked for
consequence
of a
revocation of his will , which formerly
ensued
from
a tes-
tator's dealings with his property , no longer exists (b).

of the property with which they deal (c) .
The act requires
every will to be in writing , and signed at the foot or end of
it by the testator , or by some other person in his presence ,
and by his direction , and the signature
is to
be made or
acknowledged by the testator , in the presence of two
or
more witnesses , present at the same time , and such wit-
nesses are to attest and subscribe the will in the
presence
of the testator , though
no special form of attestation
is
necessary (d).
This seems to be reasonably distinct
in specifying
the
formalities
requisite to the validity of a will , yet , questions
arose which have been thought worthy of a legislative
so-
lution , and
accordingly the Wills Act Amendment
Act ,
1852 (e) , declares that the signature of a testator shall be
valid if it be placed at or after , or following, or under , or

beside, or opposite , to the end of the will, so that it shall
be apparent on the face of the will that the testator in-
tended to give effect by such his signature to the writing
signed as his will ; and no such will is to be affected by any
of a variety of circumstances which the statute
expressly
mentions , and which indicate the questions which had arisen .
Competency
A will is not void on account of the incompetency of a
witness
to prove the
execution (f) ,
and if any
person
shall attest the execution of the will to whom or to whose
wife or husband any beneficial devise, legacy , or other gift
or
appointment
affecting
real
or
personal
estate
be
made (except charges for payment
of debts ) , the
devise ,
legacy , gift , or appointment , is to be void , but the witness
may be admitted
to prove the will (g)
A creditor , how-
ever, may attest the will without losing
his rights , even
though the will contain
a charge of his debt upon the tes-
tator's property (h), and executors are competent witnesses
to a will (¿).
Revocation
of wills .
The act also made some changes in the law as to revo-
cation of wills .
Previously
a will was considered to be
revoked upon the presumption
arising from change of cir-
cumstances , if after making
it the testator
married
and
had a child.
The present rule is , that
marriage
alone in
all cases revokes a will (k), except where it is made in ex-
ercise of a power over property which would
not , if un-
appointed , pass to the testator's own representatives .
But
no presumption
arising from
circumstances
can revoke
a
will (1)—as
a will can only be revoked , otherwise
than
by marriage , by another will or codicil
executed
as the law
requires , or by a writing executed in like manner
as wills
declaring the intention of the testator to revoke the will , or
by the burning
or otherwise destroying the same , done with
the intention
of revoking it (m) .

following rule is also intended to prevent a lapse in cases åren.
where the bounty of the testator may well be extended ; it
is that where any devise or bequest is made to a child or
other issue of the testator , and such child or other issue dies
during the testator's lifetime , and any issue of such child
or other issue shall be living at the testator's death , then
the devise or bequest is not to lapse , but to take

exactly as if the child or other issue had died immediately
after the testator's
death , unless a contrary intention

To complete

in
character
to
those which
have
been imposed
upon

The act which imposes them (b) is so framed as
to include
every case where a person acquires a beneficial

wife of the successor .
It lays
down rules for the deter-
mination of the question who , in each particular
case , is to
be deemed
the predecessor (d) , from whom the succession
is derived .
It imposes the following duties :-Where the
successor
is of the lineal issue , or lineal ancestor of the
predecessor
, a duty of one per cent . upon the value of the
succession
.
For a brother
or sister , or descendant
of a
brother
or sister of the predecessor , a duty of three per
cent. upon
such value .
For
a brother
or
sister of the
father
or mother of the predecessor, or any of their de-
scendants
, a duty of five per cent . upon
such value .
For
a brother or sister of the grandfather
or grandmother
of
the predecessor
, or any of their descendants , six per cent.
upon
such value .
For
all
other
relationships ,
and
for
strangers in blood , ten per cent . upon such value .
Rules
are laid down for the valuation of every species
of interest , which valuations
are made upon the supposi-
tion that the
succession consists of an annuity
equal to
the
annual
value of the property
(after making certain
allowances ) , and payable during
the residue of his life , or
any less
period
that he may be entitled
to it.
The act
contains
tables for the
calculation
of the
value of such
interests , and the duty is to be paid by eight equal half-
yearly
instalments , determinable
(if the interest of the
successor
be determinable ) upon the
death
of the
suc-
cessor , the first being payable one year after the death of
the person upon whose death the succession took place.
The duty is made a first charge upon the property , and
therefore it is incumbent
upon all persons dealing
with
successors
to see that the duty has been paid .
Before concluding our remarks upon the subject of title ,
we
may
here
mention
that
recently
an
act
has
been
passed (e) for the purpose of facilitating the proof of title
(d) Upon which rules a vast num-
ber of cases have already arisen for
judicial consideration , which cannot ,
however , be here noticed .

Under this
a Registry

where any owner
may register his title

They are intended
to
abolish the laborious
and expensive investigations
which
are usually undertaken
upon
every dealing

Whether the result will realise
the hopes
of

originated

remains
to

Up
to
the

,
the powers conferred

The view which we have taken of the various assurances
by which things
real may be alienated
,
completes
,
so
far
as
our limits will allow
,
the
account
which
we have
to
give
of
the mode by which title
to
them may
be
recipro-

We have before considered the
estates

in
them
,
with regard
to
their
duration
or
quantity
of
interest
,
the time
of
their enjoy-
ment
,
and the
number
and
connections
of the
persons
entitled
to
hold them
;
we have examined the tenures
,
both
ancient and modern
,
whereby those estates have been
,
and
are now
,
holden
:
and have distinguished
the object
of
all
these inquiries
,
namely
,
things
real
,
into the corporeal
or
substantial
,
and incorporeal
or
ideal kind
;
and have thus
considered the rights
of
real property
in
every light wherein
they are contemplated by the laws
of
England
.
A
system
of
laws that differs much from every other system
,
except
those
of
the same feudal origin
,
in
its notions and regula-
tions of landed estates
;
and which therefore could in this
particular
be very seldom compared with any other
.
The subject which
has thus
employed
our attention
is
of very extensive
use
,
and
of
as
extensive variety
.
And
yet
,
possibly
,
it
has afforded the student less

and pleasure in the pursuit , than the matters discussed in
the preceding volume .
To say the truth , the vast altera-
tions which the
doctrine of real property has undergone
from the conquest to the present time ; the infinite
deter-
minations
upon points that continually
arise, and which
have been heaped one upon another for a course of seven
centuries , without any order or method ; and the multi-
plicity
of
acts
of parliament
which have
amended ,
or
sometimes
only altered , the
common law : these
causes
have made the study of this branch of our national
juris-
prudence a little perplexed and intricate .
Fortunately for
us, the tendency of recent legislation has been to place the
law upon a footing almost equal in simplicity to that which
existed in the most ancient times , and yet to no inconsider-
able extent accompanied by means and appliances suitable
to our modern wants .



CHAPTER XXIV .
THINGS
PERSONAL .
things per-
UNDER the name of things personal
are, according
to What
are
its
primary
signification
,
denoted
all
sorts
of
things
sonal
.
moveable
,
which may attend
a
man's
person wherever he
goes
;
and
therefore
,
being
only the objects
of
the law
while they remain within the limits
of
its
jurisdiction
,
and being also
of
a
perishable quality
,
had not originally
so
much regard from the law
,
as
things
that are
in
their
nature
more permanent
and immoveable
,
as
lands
and
houses
,
and the profits issuing
thereout
.
The
name now
has
a
much more extensive signification
than
it
anciently
had
.
The amount
of
property
,
not
connected
with land
,
was
comparatively
very trifling
during the scarcity
of
money and the ignorance
of
luxurious
refinements which
prevailed
in
the feudal
ages
.
Hence
it
was
,
that
a
tax
of
the fifteenth
,
tenth
,
or
sometimes
a
much
larger pro-
portion
,
of
all
the
moveables
of
the
subject
,
was
fre-
quently laid without
scruple
,
and
is
mentioned
with
much
unconcern
by our ancient
historians
,
though
now
it
would justly alarm
our opulent merchants
and
stock-
holders
.
And
hence
,
likewise
,
may be derived
the fre-
quent forfeitures
inflicted
by the
common
law
of
all
a
man's goods and chattels
,
for misbehaviours
and inadver-
tencies that
at
present hardly
seem
to
deserve
so
severe
a
punishment
.
Our
ancient
law
-
books
,
which
are
founded
upon
the
feudal
provisions
,
do not therefore
often
condescend
to
regulate this
species
of
property
.
There
is
not
a
chapter
in
Britton
or
the
Mirror
,

THINGS

Chattels,
can fairly be referred to this head ; and the little that is
to be found in Glanvil , Bracton , and Fleta ,
seems
prin-
cipally borrowed
from
the
civilians .
But in
modern
times , for reasons that
are
sufficiently
apparent
to every
one, we have
learned to conceive different
ideas of it.
Our courts now regard
a man's personalty in a different
light , it is true , but with importance
nearly , if not quite ,
equal to his realty : and have adopted
a more
enlarged
and less technical mode of considering
the
one than the
other ; frequently
drawn from the rules which they found
already
established by the
Roman
law,
wherever
those
rules
appear to be well -grounded and apposite to the
case
in question , but principally from reason and convenience
,
adapted to the
circumstances
of the
times ;
preserving
still a due regard to ancient
usages , and
even a
certain
feudal
tincture ,
which
is
still
to
be
found
in
some
branches
of personal
property ,
though
not
easily dis-
cernible .
We will,
pursuing
the
plan
adopted
in
our
former
chapters concerning real property , inquire
shortly
into the
nature of the several
species
of property , then
into
the
interests which may be had in them , and afterwards
the
title by which they may be acquired and lost .
And first ,
as to their nature .
Various
phrases have been at different
times
used
to
express personal
property ,
but
they have not generally
been sufficiently
comprehensive to include all that is now
intended by that term .
Thus , the word chattels has been
used, derived by Sir Edward
Coke (a) from the
French ,
though it is in fact the same as the technical Latin
term
catalla , and primarily signified
only beasts
of husbandry
(hence
called
at
this
day
cattle).
This word
is by no
means
co-extensive with
personal
property , yet it
ac-
quired
(by being
set in
opposition
to
a feud)
a very
enlarged
meaning ;
first , it was extended to all move-

include
not
only all moveable
things
called
chattels personal (c) , but
also the inferior
interests in land , thence called chattels

real.
Chattels
real ,
says
Sir
Edward
Coke (d) ,
are such Chattels
as concern , or savour of, the realty ; as
terms for years
of land , wardship
in chivalry
(while
the military tenures
subsisted ) , the next presentation
to a church , estates
by
statute -merchant ,
statute -staple ,
elegit ,
or the
like ; of
all which we have already spoken .
And these are called
real
chattels ,
as being
interests
issuing out
of, or an-
nexed
to, real
estates
of which they have
one
quality ,
viz . , immobility
, which denominates them real ; but want
the other , viz. , a sufficient , legal indeterminate
duration
:
and this want it is that constitutes
them
chattels .
The
utmost period for which they can last is fixed
and deter-
minate , either for such
a
space
of time certain ,
or till
such a particular
sum of money be raised out of such a
particular
income ;
so that they are not equal in the
eye
of the law to the lowest
estate of freehold , a lease for
another's life : their tenants were considered upon feudal
principles ,
as merely bailiffs
or farmers ; and the tenant
of the freehold might at any time
have destroyed
their
interest , till the reign of Henry VIII . (e) .
It is unnecessary for us here to dwell
upon the nature
of these lesser interests
in lands which
are included
in
the name of chattels , having
already discussed at some
length their several natures and properties (ƒ) .

The expression

interest in land , and being
usually of a moveable nature ,
or capable of being
carried
about with the
person ,
re-
ceived the name personal ; though
Sir Edward Coke also
gives another reason , that they were capable of being re-
covered by a personal
action (g).
The two reasons , how-
ever, having probably much the same foundation , since the
word personal action must have received
its name from its
being adopted to recover things connected
with the person .
Whatever
was its origin , however , the expression
does not
sufficiently
denote all the present
classes
of property
not
connected with land ; nor does the phrase " goods , wares ,
and merchandise ," used in the
Statute
of Frauds (h) , or
that of " goods and commodities ," used in several other
acts of parliament .
The
practices
of modern
times
have given
rise
to
a
large variety of other kinds
of property , not
thought
of
in ancient times , which are not the objects of any bodily
sense , yet are
included
among personal things , and
sub-
ject to laws similar to those
governing
tangible
things ,
such as animals , furniture , and the like (¿) .
Formerly the
only
important
member
of this
class
which existed was the right to demand a sum of money ,
either founded upon debt or upon other grounds .
From
this
the
name " thing,"
or " chose
in
action ,"
was
adopted to describe them .
The
name indicates
that the
material value of the property consisted in the right to
invoke
the aid of the
court :
and the peculiar
notions
which
our
ancestors
entertained
as
to this right , have
given rise to many of the most remarkable , and some of
the most inconvenient , doctrines which
have affected
this
species
of property ,
and which are only now gradually
disappearing , but not yet altogether gone (j) .

But
many of the
species
of property which
now exist
are not in their nature at all connected with actions
at
law, and therefore , though they frequently
are described
as
choses
in action , yet such description
is not accurate,
and the peculiar notions before alluded
to do not apply to
them .
Concerning
the first class of personal things , or things
capable of bodily
sense , such
as furniture , plate , imple-
ments of husbandry
or of war , jewels , and the like , which
from the visible
possession which may be had of them ,
are
called things in
possession ,
thereby
distinguishing
them from things
in
action , it is not necessary to say
much .
The
complete
ownership
of them
involves
the
right to use them in the most absolute way , even though
such user may entirely consume them .
The law concerning
some few particular
varieties , such
as heirlooms , heriots
(usually
now consisting
only of a
money
payment ,
though
formerly
a chattel ) , and mor-
tuaries (like heriots , now consisting of a money payment ,
though formerly
not
so ) , is regulated by custom .
As to
others , such as fixtures , emblements , &c., we have seen (k)
that whilst affixed to or ground in the soil they are subject
to special conditions
as to ownership
and enjoyment .
Of
others , of which ships
are the most important , the law
depends entirely upon legislative
enactment .
Ships , from the
circumstances
attending
their
user , Ships.
their constant
absence
from this country and , often , from
the visible possession of their owner, have , by the policy
of the law, been placed upon a peculiar footing , and made
subject to peculiar
laws .
In the year
1854 all previous
acts on the
subject were repealed (1) , and
a general
act
consolidating
the law relative
to merchant
shipping
was
passed (m).

to
the
laws
prescribed
by
the
act.
The details of the act cannot find a place here.
The second class of personal things are of an intangible
,
incorporeal
nature , called by the general
name things
or
choses in action .
Choses in action , strictly so called , depend , in general ,
upon
contract ;
the
peculiarities
and varieties
of their
nature
depend , for the
most
part , upon
the
mode
and
extent of the relief which the courts afford to contracting
parties .
Of this we shall speak at large in the third book
of these commentaries .
We say, in general , for there are
some rights of action which depend upon other grounds .
Instances of these are, damages for slander
or libel ; for
injury to one's
person , or the loss of the life of a near
relation , upon whom one depends for support (0) , arising
from the improper
negligence of another .
These and the
like hardly
rest upon
contract , unless it be the general
contract which
is implied in the very essence
of society ,
the contract not to injure any other member of the society ;
and in many instances it has
required
the authority of
parliament
to give them a legal sanction .
The other species of property (often, though not reason-
ably ) included in the name of choses in action , consists of
such artificial
contrivances as have been developed princi-
pally in recent times .
The first and most important
of
these is stock in the public funds of a nation , that is to say,
a portion of a national
debt , which differs from every other
debt in this respect , that the courts can
afford
no aid
to
the creditor .
As to the English public funds , they are in
reality nothing
more than the right , sanctioned by parlia-
ment , to receive certain
annuities
from
the
State .

Before this
act, though , if a man were injured ,
but not killed ,
he might
have re-
dress in damages ; yet if his sup-
port were
altogether
lost
to
his
family by death ,
no redress
could
be obtained by those who were thus
deprived of their
subsistence .

PUBLIC
FUNDS .
577
Annuities (as one of the kind is called) to demand
pay-
ment of the 100 %. , but only the right to an annual
pay-
ment of 31.
The
Government , on the other hand , have
the
right
to
redeem
the
annuity
by payment
of
the
nominal
amount of the stock-a right , however , which is
never exercised , as the market
price is hardly ever equal
to the nominal
amount .
When the commissioners for the
reduction
of the national
debt have money applicable to
the purpose for which they hold their office , they purchase
stock in the market from those who are willing to sell at the
market price , and the stock so purchased is cancelled (p) .
Other Governments , such as those of British India and
the autonomous colonies , have invariably adopted a different
system in this respect, their
public
loans being all made
repayable
at fixed
dates, with interest
in the
meantime .
Holders
of these
securities
must
rely
upon
the
good
faith of the Government which guarantees
the payment ,
a reliance which is readily placed upon the Imperial and
British
Colonial Governments , and , indeed , upon
many
foreign
powers .
But , as is obvious , should there be any
disregard
of the rights
possessed
by
fundholders ,
no
remedy can be obtained by aid of the courts .
A convenient system of registration
of fundholders
in
the
English
and Indian funds
has been adopted at the
expense of the State , by which
the names of the legal
holder
or
holders
are
inscribed
in the
books of the
governor and company of the Bank of England.
The stock
is considered as legally
vested
in those whose
names
are
so inscribed , and can be
transferred
only by the owner
or his duly-constituted
attorney
signing
suitable
trans-
fers in books kept for that
purpose by the same bank .
The bank
only recognizes the person
appearing
on their
books as the owner , and does not take any notice of trusts ,
and is not bound
to do so even if express notice be given
to them .
Moreover , the bank will only open one account.

with the same individual, and in no case will allow more
than four persons to have a joint account .
The bank, however , will so far recognize the interest of
other persons besides those named in its books , that it
accepts service of a writ of distringas , as it is called , which
may be issued out of Chancery , in
a fictitious
suit (1) , by
any person who claims to be beneficially
interested in any
manner in stock.
The effect of this writ is , that the bank
is bound to give notice to the person who has served it
before registering
a transfer , which may have
been at-
tempted to be made by the person in whom the stock is
legally vested .
The bank is not able to refuse to transfer
the stock for more than eight days after request has been
made, unless in the meantime
an order is made by the
court in a properly -constituted
suit (r).
Under the Trustee Acts (s) the Court of Chancery may , in
proper cases , similar to those already noticed (t) as to the
legal estates in land vested in trustees , make orders to vest
the legal interest in stock in such person as the court may
direct , and in such cases the order of the court operates
as a transfer , which
the bank is bound to regard , and is
by the act indemnified in so doing ( u).
By a recent
act (v) the
Bank of England
may
issue
certificates of title of stock in respect of any sum of stock
being
50 %. , or a multiple of 507. (not exceeding
1000 %) ,
with coupons attached for the dividends accruing due for a
period of five years from the date of the certificate

session of which carries with it the right of receiving the
annual interest and the principal sum secured, and which
pass by simple delivery from hand to hand .

upon the art and ingenuity
and industry of man , and the
estimation given to the products arising from those quali-
ties . It includes several varieties :
1. Copyright of books
and writings.
2.
Patents
for invention .
3. Designs for
manufacture .
4. The indicia of commercial
reputation ,
trademark , and the goodwill of a business .
The first
three of these
depend
now
upon
statutory
enactment ,
although they were not wholly unprotected by the common
law (b ) ; the last still
rests
upon
the
doctrines
of the
courts .
We will
say a few words
upon
each
subject ,
though our disquisition
must necessarily be short .
1. The
copyright
of books
and
other writings is
the
right which the law affords for protecting
the produce of
man's
intellectual
industry from being
made use of by
others without adequate recompense
to him.
When
a
man , by the exertion of his rational
powers, has produced
an original work, he seems to have clearly
a right to dis-
pose of that identical work as he pleases , and any attempt
to vary the disposition
he has made of it appears to be an
invasion
of that
right .
Now the
identity
of a literary
composition
consists
entirely
in the
sentiment
and the
language ( c) ; the
same
conceptions , clothed in the same
words , must
necessarily be the same composition
: and
whatever method be taken of exhibiting
that composition
to the ear or the eye of another , by recital , by writing , or
by printing , in any number of copies, or at any period of
time , it is always the identical work of the author which
is so exhibited ; and no other man (it has been thought)
can have a right to exhibit it , especially for profit , without
the author's consent.
Before the era of printing these rights must necessarily

and

have
stood
upon a footing
different
in many
respects
to
that on which they are now placed .
The mechanical pro-
cess of publishing
works
must then have had an import-
ance greater , relatively to the matter published , than now .
Consequently
the necessity of protection
by law was less ,
if at all, felt.
Accordingly
the Roman law is silent upon.
the subject of an author's
rights
; all the notice which it
took of writings was simply
to declare , that if one
man
wrote on the paper or parchment of another , the ownership
of the blank materials remained unaffected (d ) .
Not that
the law was regardless of the respect due to genius
and
intellectual
or artistic
power , for the same law declared (e)
that a painter , who used another's canvas , by the fact of his
artistic
creation acquired the property in the picture , being ,
it is presumed , bound to indemnify
the owner of the can-
vas .
So we find but few instances in our ancient law in
which the matter has been discussed , though it is certain
that the law considered
an
author
entitled
to
protec-
tion (f).
The law,
however ,
having
been
settled
by
statute , the common law on the subject , whatever it was ,
has been abrogated .
The earliest statute is 8 Anne , c . 19 , which , after being
several times amended and altered (g), has been
repealed
,
and the right now wholly
rests upon an act of the present
reign (h) , by which " the sole and exclusive liberty of print-
ing
or otherwise multiplying copies " (¿) of any " book "
(which word in the act referred
to has a very extensive
signification ) (k) is reserved to the author
and his repre-
sentatives for the term of his
natural
life and ten years
afterwards , or for the term of forty -two years , whichever

is the longer period . This right is made subject to certain
conditions , the most important of which
are the presenta-
tion , within one month after publication
, of a copy to the
British Museum , and within twelve months to the Bodleian
library at Oxford, the Cambridge
University library, the
Advocates ' library at Edinburgh , and that of Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin .
The proprietorship
must also be registered
at Stationers ' Hall in a book kept for that purpose (1).
In order to
secure
the benefit of the copyright
the book
must be first published in England (1) .
We
may add , that the same act
secured to musical
composers and
dramatic
authors
the
sole
right of per-
forming
their compositions , or representing
their
pieces
for the same term for which copyright
is granted (m).
2. Patents for invention
stand upon somewhat similar,
though far from
identical , grounds
as
copyrights .
The
progress of inventions
in matters
relating
to manufac-
tures (to which the majority of inventions
belong ) is such,
that many persons are at work at the same time in the
same
direction ;
and often the same idea is hit or con-
ceived by several
nearly
simultaneously : moreover , the
refinements and improvements
upon each successive device
follow each other so rapidly , that it is difficult to deter-
mine to whom of several inventors the chief or distinctive
merit belongs .
Such conflicts as occur daily between rival
inventors , can rarely
take
place
between rival
authors .
Consequently , although
a similar
desire
to give
some
reward to an inventor
as is obtained
by authors is natu-
rally entertained , yet it is far less
easy to put into practice .
Moreover , the highly expensive nature of the litigation ,
which ensues
upon questions
of infringement
of patents ,
is
such
as to preclude
those
whose
means are
small ,
(1) Routledge v. Low, L. R. H. L.
3 E. & I. 100 ; where also the rights
of an alien are discussed , and some
difference

opinion
expressed ;
though it was held
that if resident
in England
at the
time
of publica-
tion he might
acquire copyright.

These considerations

If doubted.
they fail in their
object of securing
to a first and true
inventor
an adequate reward
for his industry , the argu-
ment founded on the public
policy of encouraging
inven-
tion falls to the ground .
Nevertheless , inasmuch
as at
present the law is in full
force, some
notice of the right
thereby created is required here.
In ancient times the notion of giving a monopoly of a
particular manufacture
was familiar to many as a royal
device of benefiting favourite subjects ; but was one by no
means looked
upon with approbation
by any but
those
whose interest
was thus
advanced.
Their illegality was
often
insisted
upon , both by
charters
and statutes , and
was in the
reign
of Elizabeth
solemnly
declared (n).
An
exception
was, however ,
made in the
case
of an
introducer
of a new trade ,
or
the
inventor
of
a new
machine .
The
statute of monopolies
( 21 Jac.
1 , c.
3) ,
which
was
passed
not long
afterwards ,
adopted this
view ,
and
allowed
a
royal
patent
of
privilege
to
be
granted
for fourteen
years , to any
inventor
of a new
manufacture , for the sole working or making of the same.
This statute has been in this ,
as in other instances of
tentative
legislation , followed
by numerous
others , the
details of which it is needless here to refer to.
The whole
right of patentees now depends
upon
an act passed in the
year 1852 (0) ; for , though the act
creates
no right in the
crown to grant a patent ,—such right being inherent ,—yet ,
unless the patent accords with the provisions of the act, it
is declared to be void .
We can here only very shortly notice what
these pro-
visions are.
The
most
important
of them
seem to be
these .
The subject -matter of the patent
must be a new

manufacture , not used by others at the time of making
the letters patent : the question whether
any particular
alleged
invention
is
new
has
been
one fruitful ,
to
a
remarkable
extent , with litigation
.
Next , the patentee must be the true and first inventor
;
but for the purpose of this requirement , the first introducer
from abroad is considered to be the inventor of the subject
of the patent .
Lastly , the patentee must , in a document
called
the
specification , accurately describe the nature of his inven-
tion , and how it is to be performed , and
state
exactly
what he claims as his
invention .
This must
be filed in
the Court of Chancery , within six months after the letters
patent are granted
; though
it may be, and often is , filed
with the petition for the grant (p).
Should , however , the
patentee afterwards
find that he has claimed
too much ,
he may disclaim the part which is in excess of his proper
invention (9) .
Patents for warlike inventions may be pur-
chased by the state , in which
case
they
are kept
secret ,
and no specification
is filed (r).
3.
Patterns
or
designs
for manufactures , such
as for
carpets, paperhangings , and the like, are also, when duly
registered according to law, protected from being imitated
without the permission of the designer .
The act by which
this right is conferred (s) distinguishes
several
classes
of
manufactures , the ornamentation
of which
is protected ,
and different periods , varying
from
nine months
to three
years , are assigned during which the protection applies .
Under the act, a registrar
is appointed for the purpose
of registering
the design , and receiving copies, drawings ,
&c. , of it : these are afterwards
open for public inspec-
tion .
These
copies or drawings , which the
act requires
to be deposited with the registrar , must

which a man claims and exercises over the external things
of the world , in total exclusion of the right of other men .
And
yet
there
are
few that
consider
the
origin
and
foundation
of
this
right .
We
are
pleased with
the
possession, and we care not to look back to the means by
which it was acquired , as if fearful of some defect in our
title ; or at best we rest satisfied with the decision
of the
laws in
our
favour , without
examining
the reason
or
authority
upon which those laws
have
been
built .
We
think it enough
that our title is derived by the grant of
the
former
proprietor ,
by
descent from our
ancestors ,
or by the
last will and
testament
of the dying
owner ;
not caring to reflect that (accurately and strictly speaking )
there is no foundation
in nature or in natural
law , why a
set of words upon parchment should
convey the dominion
of land ;
why the
son should
have a right to exclude
his fellow-creatures from a determinate
spot of ground ,
because his father had done so before him :
or why the
occupier of a particular
field or of a jewel , when lying on
his
death-bed ,
and no
longer
able to
maintain
posses-
sion , should be entitled to tell the rest of the world which
of them
should
enjoy it after
him .
These
inquiries , it
must be owned , would be useless
and even troublesome in
common life. It is in practice well if the mass of mankind
will obey the laws
when made , without scrutinizing too
nicely into the reasons of making
them , so long as those
laws are clearly for the benefit of society.
But , when law
is to be considered
not only as a matter of practice , but
also as a rational
science , it cannot be improper
or useless
to examine
more deeply the rudiments
and
grounds
of
these positive constitutions
of society.
In the present
stage of scientific
examination
into the
early history of man , it is not possible
to do more than
state
a probable
theory of the origin of law as regards
property .
As the reason of man by degrees
enabled him
to acquire
dominion
over
the
whole
animal
kingdom
,
there must have grown up at the same
time the
sense of


THE
NATURE
AND
ORIGIN

RIGHTS .
power which superiority of intelligence
induces in conflict
not
only with unreasoning
animals
,
but even with
other
men
.
This power would obviously
seek its first grati-
fication
in
the enjoyment
of
the largest attainable amount
of
physical
pleasure
.
So
long
as
nature
abundantly
supplied
the
purposes
of
human
life
,
by the
exercise
of
only the pleasurable
excitement
of
the
chase
or
by
merely reaping the
natural
fruits
of
the earth
,
and
so
long
as
their
mental
developement
was
insufficient
to
suggest
to
men any further wants than those of food and
rest
,
there would seem
to
be small
place for the idea
of
property
to
gain ground
.
But the most
ancient
records
which modern
researches
have brought
to
light
of
man's
habitations
tell
us
that the period
of
an
amply sufficient
natural supply
of
the necessities
of
life
to
every individual
man was
,
if
it
ever existed
,
not
of
long duration
;
for
,
at
least
in
the colder climates
of
northern
regions
,
some-
thing
of
the
nature
of
houses
must
soon
be
felt
as
necessities
(a),
and the mere mention
of
structures erected
by
labour draws with
it
the concurrent idea
of
their owner-
ship
by
individuals
.
For there
always
must
have been
an
inequality
of
powers
in
individuals
,
and
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
any state
of
society
in
which
the
superior
strength
or
intelligence
of
one man
as
compared with that
of
others
,
would
not
be
exercised for his
own especial
benefit
.
It
may
in
fact be reasonably doubted whether
at
any
time when men enjoyed the result
of
labour
in
the form
of
substantial
and permanent works
,
there was
or
could be
a
communion
of
goods

PROPERTY
IN GENERAL .
between
ownership
and the right of user of a material
object , which in the
case of a
natural
thing
not the
production
of
labour ,
has
some
apparent
foundation .
By the law of nature
and
reason , he, who first
began to
use it, acquired therein
a kind of transient property , that
lasted
so long as he was using it, and no longer
(c) : or,
to speak with greater
precision , the right of possession
continued
for
such
time
only
as
the act of possession
lasted .
Thus the ground was in common , and no part of
it was the permanent property of any man in particular
;
yet whoever was in the
occupation
of any
determined
spot of it, for rest , for shade
or the like, acquired for the
time a sort of ownership , from which it would
have been
unjust and contrary to the law of nature , to have driven
him by force
but the instant
that he quitted
the use or
occupation of it , another might seize it without
injustice .
Again , a vine
or other tree growing
naturally
might be
said to be in common , as all men were equally entitled to
its
produce ; and yet any private
individual
might
gain
the sole property of the fruit , which
he had gathered for
his own
repast .
This doctrine
is illustrated
by Cicero ,
who compares the world to a great theatre , which is com-
mon to the public , and yet the place which any man has
taken is for the time his own (d).
But the distinction
seems
one rather
of words
than
substance.
Because , in many cases , the only right which
a man can have is but
one of user
during
his
lifetime .
He cannot destroy land , nor
does it cease to exist
after
his death , and though
he may be allowed
to
a limited
extent to point out who
shall
have the use afterwards ,
these rights of property which he exercises only differ in
degree ,
and not in kind , from
the
rights
of possession
above noticed .

in possession of a piece of land
to prevent
others from
interfering
with his enjoyment , is not different from that
which
enables
him to consume absolutely the fruits , even
though
it
may
be
that
through
circumstances
or the
habits
of his life there
comes
a time when he
ceases
to
care for the possession, and so abandons it.
All ques-
tions in fact of the original
right of property , hang upon
the
circumstance
whether
or
not
there is by
nature a
practically unlimited
supply of fresh land or other objects
of man's
wishes.
If there be, the idea of property is
almost
unnecessary ; if there
be
not , it at
once
comes
into play.
property.
As soon, therefore , as mankind
increased in number , it Separate
became necessary to entertain
conceptions of permanent
dominion ;
and to
appropriate
to
individuals
not the
immediate
use only , but the very substance of the thing
to be used .
Otherwise
innumerable
tumults
must
have
arisen , and the
good order of the world
been
continually
broken
and
disturbed , while
a variety
of persons were
striving who should
get the first occupation of the same
thing , or disputing
which of them had actually gained it .
The
growth of intelligence
and ingenuity
, in contriving
means
for meeting the increasing
wants
of men , would
naturally be accompanied by the developement of the idea
that something
more than
mere enjoyment , protected by
the strong arm of the holder , was involved in the relations
of men and things .
The idea of justice allowing
posses-
sion to remain with the weak , even in the presence
of the
strong, would spring up.
This , like the reed which bows
before
the
storm
without
breaking , must
pass
through
many vicissitudes , which
history
sufficiently
exemplifies ,
but even
among
the rudest
nations its roots have always
remained alive.
The idea of property, then , or the right of user of those
things which
are
not and can not be destroyed by their
use, and the right of consuming those things
quae ipso usu
consumuntur,
takes
its
origin
from
some
of
the
very


6
PROPERTY
IN

fundamental
requirements of society.
The ground of this
right is apparent enough when exercised by an individual
man over
a thing which
owes its value entirely
to labour ,
that is an article which is made out of materials
supplied
by nature in abundance .
He who bestowed the
labour ,
and thus in a sense created the article , is obviously
the
owner of it (e).
Some further
difficulty exists in the investigation
how
property is first acquired , or to what principle it owes its.
origin , when the subject of the right is apparently
a thing
existing by nature , and to some extent valuable in itself,
without
the expenditure of any labour upon it.
Land , for
instance , seems to be of this kind.
The difficulty
is , how-
ever , only apparent , because
in reality
the
case
scarcely
can have occurred . If land
be of unlimited extent , as
where a few people land
upon
a large
uninhabited
con-
tinent , it cannot be said to have a value , every person may
take
as
much as he requires , and the very fact of his
taking possession and setting it apart for himself, leading
as it certainly
would
do to his expending
some labour
upon it, places this case of land in the same category as a
boat
manufactured
out of wood taken from a primeval
forest .
Occupancy
and
labour ,
which
are almost
convertible
terms , seem therefore
to be the basis upon which
the
theory
of property
rests.
And it is to
be noticed that
the
extent
of
the
right
arising
from this
occupancy
is not
a matter
which is concerned in the first
enjoy-
(e) Mr. Locke
says,
" That the
labour of a
man's
body ,
and the
work of his hands , we may say are
properly
his.
Whatsoever
then
he
removes
out of the
state that na-
ture hath provided
and left it in,
he hath mixed his labour with, and
joined to it
something
that is his
own ,
and
thereby
makes it
his
property ."
(On Gov. c. 5. )
This
of course only applies
to the case
where there is no contract
express
or implied
with another
respecting
the thing in
question ,
and
also
where
the
material
is
really the
property
of no
one, which though
hardly possible
in
a country
like
England ,
may
exist in a country
where
there are regions of land un-
claimed by any one.

ment.
Whether
or
not a man
may have the
power
of saying who shall enjoy the land after his death , so that
his words
shall
be
respected , or whether
or
not , in the
event
of his
saying
nothing , his
son or somebody else
shall have the land , can be determined by no first prin-
ciple ofjustice such as that which decides that
so long
as
he himself lives , he shall not be ousted .
Such
questions
must of necessity depend upon
the common
consent of
men , unless left to the simple arbitrament
of the sword ,
so that he who is strongest shall come and claim both of
right
and
of might .
The
solutions
they have received
have materially differed in
different
countries .
Of this
we shall
see more hereafter .
But we cannot
agree with some writers on natural
law,
such as Grotius and Puffendorf, who think that the whole
right of possession and enjoyment arising from occupancy
is founded on a tacit and implied
but special
assent of all
mankind ,
that
the
first
occupant
should
become
the
owner ; we hold with
Barbeyrac , Titius , Mr. Locke , and
others , that there is no such implied
assent, neither
is it
necessary that there should be ; for the very act of occu-
pancy , being
a
degree
of bodily labour , is ,
alone , from
an obvious principle
of natural
justice , without
any con-
sent or compact ,
sufficient of itself to gain a title .
To
go deeper
than this , and seek the cause why men should
have adopted and enforced
any principle of natural justice ,
would lead
into
disquisitions
inappropriate
to this place.
We have
already (f) sufficiently
indicated
the
ground
upon which all laws must rest, and no reasonable distinc-
tion can
be
drawn
between
those
which
sanction
the
right of property , and those which protect a man's life and
limb from the assault
of others (g) .

Origin of

originally
acquired
by the
first
taker ,
whose
taking
amounts
to a declaration
that he intends
to appropriate
the thing to his
own
use , remains in him, by the prin-
ciples of universal
law, till
such time
as he does
some
other act which
shows
an
intention
to abandon it ; for
then it becomes, naturally
speaking , publici juris
once
more , and is liable
to be again
appropriated
by the next
occupant .
So, if one is possessed
of a jewel , and casts it
into the sea or a public
highway , this is such an express
dereliction , that a property will be vested in the first for-
tunate finder that will seize it to his own use .
But if he
hides it privately in the earth or other secret place, and it
is discovered , the finder acquires no property therein ; for
the owner does not then indicate any intention
to abandon
it, but rather
the contrary : and if he loses or drops it by
accident , no design to abandon it can be inferred
; there-
fore in such a case the property still remains in the loser ,
who may claim it again of the finder .
And this , in fact ,
is
the
doctrine of the law of England with relation
to
treasure trove .
But this method of one man's abandoning his property ,
ances, wills , and another
seizing
the vacant
possession , however well
founded in theory , could not long continue , even if it ever
did subsist in fact .
It might suffice merely for the rudi-
ments of civil
society, whilst there was no difficulty in
finding unoccupied
land , but
could not be applicable
to
any country
so far peopled that all valuable land had been
taken
possession of,
and it necessarily entirely
ceased
to
exist when other substantial wealth , derived from artificial
culture
or
the
production
of man's
labour ,
formed
a
material
part of a man's
desires.
Because it followed
that even if a man
ceased
to
have a personal
desire to
retain
lands , yet there would
be other things
which
he
would desire ; if therefore
the
right
of
declaring
who
should be the next
occupant were established , he in fact
obtained means of securing some desired object .
This very
simple
and
obvious
accessory
to the
original right
of

, WILLS ,

undisturbed
possession
arising from occupancy would
be
soon recognised
by society as a general
benefit .
At the
same
time
it might easily
be,
and
in
fact in
many
countries
even in the
earliest
times
it was, that
some
restriction
as to the mode of transfer should be insisted
upon for the benefit of society ,
because
a fundamental
principle underlies every system of society that the posses-
sion of property
draws with it
some
correlative
duties ,
the discharge of which must not be rendered impossible .
What
these
duties may be depends upon the conditions
of society , and will be found to differ materially
according
to the state of civilization
.
Amongst
people of a savage
and warlike character , the
general
defence
is
always
a
prominent feature of such obligations .
Among
other modes of giving up possession of property ,
the one which
is at the same time most universal and most
important
in its results
as
affecting
the relations of the
owner to society at large is that by the death of the owner ,
and accordingly
we find that
this case has been provided
for , to some extent, in almost every nation . If the right
of an owner of property depended only upon the natural
right of
possession
accompanying
the act of occupancy ,
when both the actual possession and intention of keeping
possession
cease , the property , which is founded upon such
possession
and intention ,
ought
of course
also to cease .
For, naturally speaking , the instant a man ceases
to be,
he ceases to have any dominion
:
else , if he had a right to
dispose of his acquisitions for one moment beyond his life,
he would also have
a right to direct
their
disposal
for
a
million of ages after his death : which
would be highly
absurd and inconvenient . All property must therefore cease
upon death , if men are considered
as absolute individuals
,
unconnected with civil society , and the next immediate oc-
cupant acquires
a right in all that the deceased
possessed
.
But as, under civilized
governments which
are calculated
for the peace of mankind , such a constitution
would
be
productive
of endless
disturbances , it
has
almost
uni-

versally
been
permitted
to the dying
person to exercise a
power of continuing
his property , by disposing
of his
possessions by will ; or, in case he neglects to dispose of
it,
or is
not
permitted
to make
any disposition
at all ,
the law of the country then
steps in , and declares who
shall
be the
successor,
representative ,
or
heir
of the
deceased
;
that is , who alone shall
have a right to enter
upon this vacant
possession, in order to avoid that
con-
fusion
which its becoming
again
common
would
occa-
sion (h).
And farther , in case no testament
be permitted
by the law, or none be made , and
no heir can be found
qualified
as the law requires , still , to prevent the robust
title of occupancy from again taking place , the doctrine of
escheats
is adopted
in
almost
every country ;
whereby
either
the
state
takes
possession for the benefit of the
community , or the sovereign becomes the owner , which
is, or ought to be, the same thing.
Some right of inheritance , or descent to the children
and
relations
of the
deceased ,
seems
to have been
allowed
much earlier than any right of devising by testament . We
are apt to conceive at first view that it has nature on its
side; yet we often mistake for nature what we find esta-
blished
by long and inveterate custom .
It is certainly
a
wise and effectual , but clearly a political , establishment
;
since the permanent
right of property ,
vested
in the an-
cestor himself, was no natural , but merely a civil , right .
It is true , that the transmission
of one's possessions to
posterity
has an evident
tendency to make a man a good
citizen
and a useful
member of society : it sets
the pas-
sions on the side of duty , and prompts a man
to deserve
well of the public , when he is sure that the reward
of his
services will
not die with himself, but
be transmitted
to
those with whom he is connected by the dearest and most
(h) It is principally to
prevent
any vacancy of possession , that the
civil law
considers
father and
son
one
person ; so that upon
the
death
of either ,
the
inheritance
does not so
properly descend ,
as
continue
in the
hands
of the
sur-
vivor.

NECESSARILY ARBITRARY .
tender affections .
Yet , reasonable
as this foundation
of
the right of inheritance
may seem , it is probable
that its
immediate
origin did not arise from speculations
so deli-
cate and refined , and , if not from fortuitous circumstances ,
at least
from
a plainer
and more
simple
principle .
A
man's children
or nearest relations
have usually assisted
in his labours , and shared their fruits , they are about him
on his death-bed, and
are the earliest
witnesses of his
decease .
They became therefore generally
the next im-
mediate
occupants , till at length
in process
of time this
frequent usage ripened into general law.
While property continued only for life, testaments were
useless
and unknown
; and , when it became inheritable ,
the inheritance
was long indefeasible , and the children
or
heirs at law were incapable of exclusion by will.
Till at
length it was found , that so strict a rule of inheritance
made
heirs
disobedient
and headstrong , defrauded
cre-
ditors of their just debts, and prevented many provident
fathers
from
dividing
or
charging
their estates
as the
exigence of their
families
required .
This
introduced
pretty
generally
the right of disposing
of property , or
a part of it, by testament ;
that is , by written
or
oral
instructions
properly witnessed and authenticated , accord-
ing to the pleasure of the
deceased
; which we therefore
emphatically
style his will.
This was established in some.
countries much later than in others . With us in England ,
till modern
times , a man could only dispose of one -third
of his moveables from his wife
and children
; and , in
general , no will
was
permitted of lands till the reign of
Henry VIII.; and then only for a certain portion : for it
was
not till
after
the
Restoration
that the
power of
devising real property became
so universal
as at present .

neither
does
any thing vary more than
the right
of inheritance
under different national establishments .
In
England particularly, this diversity
has been carried
to
great lengths , almost as if it had been meant to point out the
power of the laws in regulating
the succession to property ,
and how futile every claim must be, that has not its foun-
dation in the positive
rules of the state.
In general only
the eldest son , in some places only the youngest , in others
all the sons together , have a right to succeed
to the inhe-
ritance of land : and again males are preferred to females ;
but in the division of goods and chattels and other pro-
perty of the kind called
personal
estate, the females of
equal degree
are admitted
together with the males , and
no right of primogeniture
is allowed ( ?) .
There
are
some few things, which ,
notwithstanding
the
general
introduction
and
continuance
of property ,
water, &c.
must still unavoidably
remain in common ; being
such
that
nothing but
an
usufructuary
property
is
capable
of being
had in them ; and therefore they still belong to
the first occupant , during
the time he holds possession of
them ,
and
no
longer .
Such (among
others)
are the
elements of light, air,
and water ; which
a
man
may
occupy by means of his windows , his gardens , his mills ,
and other conveniences ; such also are the generality of
those animals which
are
said to be feræ naturæ , or of a
wild and untameable
disposition
:
which any man may
seize and keep for his own
use
or pleasure .
All these
things , so long as they remain in possession, every
man
has
a right
to
enjoy without disturbance
; but if once
they escape
from his custody , or he voluntarily abandons
the use of them , they return
to the common stock , and
any man else has an equal right to seize and enjoy them
(i) Much public
attention
is
at
the present time
(1869) directed to
this variegated
law of succession ,
and a bill has been introduced
into
Parliament
to
abolish
primogeni-
ture and
assimilate
the inheritance
of land to the
succession
to goods
and chattels .

afterwards
; but
even
the
enjoyment
of these will
be
subject
to divers regulations
and restrictions
in a highly
artificial state of society
such as exists in England
, where ,
moreover , the density of population
and the consequent
pressure upon the resources
of nature induce each man to
take the utmost advantage
of his rights .
We shall here-
after dwell more upon this subject .
There
are , besides , other things in which
permanent
property may exist , which yet , from the circumstance of
their not rendering any profit to the owner , would , in the
early stages of a country's history , not be appropriated
to
any individual
owner .
Such are waste grounds and forest
lands , which , though at the present day far from value-
less , would not have
been of much
esteem
two thousand
years
ago
even in England .
In order to avoid the dis-
turbances
and
quarrels
which
frequently
arise
among
individuals
contending
about the acquisition of this
spe-
cies of property by first
occupancy, the law wisely
cuts
up the root of dissension by vesting the things
themselves
in the sovereign of the state :
or
else in his represen-
tatives
appointed and authorized
by him, being
usually
the lords of manors .
The legislature of England has en-
deavoured to promote the grand
ends of civil society, the
peace and security of individuals , by pursuing
that
wise
and orderly maxim , of assigning
to
every thing capable
of ownership a legal and determinate owner .
Though
it
must be confessed
that in the course
of doing
so it has
occasionally introduced
and sanctioned many highly arti-
ficial
and
some
very inconvenient
doctrines which it has
been and is the task of the present century to modify or
abrogate .

CHAPTER II.
REAL
PROPERTY
,
ITS
CLASSIFICATION
AND
LEGAL
NATURE .
By English law the objects of property
are things
as
distinguished
from
persons :
and things
are distributed
into two primary
classes , things real and things
personal .
The former class contains those things which are by their
nature
permanent
and immoveable ,
such
as
land,
and
profitable rights
connected
with and arising out of them ,
and capable of being
enjoyed in perpetuity .
The
latter
class
contains
those things
which
are by their
nature
moveable , such as goods and money , and profitable rights
connected with them , such as a right to demand
them or

The origin of this theory will

In treating

we will consider , in the first place , their
several
sorts or
kinds .

hereditaments (a).
Land, according to the legal acceptation of the word , com-
prehends all things of a substantial
immoveable
nature ;
it is
a word of very extensive meaning ( b) , including all
kinds of ground , arable , meadows , pastures , woods , moors ,
marshes , furze , and heaths : also everything fixed or united
with the soil , such as houses and other buildings
, trees , or
even unsevered
crops (c) .
It also includes pools , water-
courses
or other waters , which are in fact
as well
as in
law land
covered
with water (d) ; for water in
a water-
course , being
a moveable , wandering
thing, must
neces-
sarily
by its nature
continue ,
to a considerable
extent ,
common , and so no permanent property can be enjoyed in
it ; if there be a flow of water from a man's
pool to that
of his neighbour , he has no right to reclaim it.
The land
under
the water alone therefore is capable of being
the
object of rights of ownership
(e) , though these may draw
with them other rights relative to the water .
(a) These
terms
are fully
de-
scribed in Co. Litt. 4a to 6b.

to these
last,
however ,

rights have in
certain cases
been

them from the soil

of
convenience , as will be seen

Again , it is usually the case
that whatever is in a direct vertical
line from the surface
of the earth downwards
belongs
to the
owner of the sur-
face .
Minerals
belong usually to the owner of the surface .
We say usually , because
the law admits of there
being
separate owners of the surface and of the minerals beneath ,
such division of the property
arising
sometimes
by con-
tract or other dealings between men , and sometimes even
by rule of law.
Thus
a man , being
owner of the land ,
may sell or otherwise
dispose of the minerals , retaining
the surface and giving
his purchaser only a right of so far
breaking
the surface as may be necessary for the purpose
of opening
a mine .

everything
under it or over it ;

CHAPTER XXV.
PROPERTY
IN
THINGS
PERSONAL .
HAVING in our last chapter
distinguished
the various
kinds of personal property , we now come to deal with the
nature of the interest which may be had in them .
As to
chattels real , or interests in land , nothing
need be added
to what has already appeared.
As to all things in possession of an inanimate
nature ,
as plate , money , jewels , and the like , as also fixtures
and
plants when severed
from all connection with the soil , we
need only remark
that they cannot be removed out of the
owner's possession without his
own act or consent , or, at
least , without doing him an injury , which it is the business
of the law to prevent or remedy .
But with regard to the property in animals , which
have
in themselves a principle and power of motion , and (unless
particularly confined) can convey themselves from one part
of the world
to another , there is a great difference made
with respect to their several
classes , not only in our law,
but in the law of nature and of all civilized
nations .
It is no part of the lawyer to enter into a classification
by zoological
principles .
It is, and must
be
sufficient
for him to point out those distinctions
which
exist
ac-
cording
to the established
customs of society ,
and
the
express declarations of law.
These, when broad
enough ,
will lead to sufficiently
satisfactory results .
In this view ,
then , animals may be divided into those which are usually
tame , such
as
horses , kine ,
sheep , fallow deer (a), pigs ,
(a) Ford v. Tynte , 31 L. J. Ch. 177.


PROPERTY
IN
ANIMALS
.
587
poultry, and the like, and those which
are usually wild .
No difficulty
occurs in distinguishing
them , and of the
former class a man may have as absolute a property
as in
any inanimate beings ; because
these continue perpetually
in his
occupation , and will not
stray from his house or
person , unless
by accident
or fraudulent
enticement , in
either of which cases the owner
does
not lose
his pro-
perty (b).
The
stealing ,
or forcible
abduction , of such
property
as this , is criminal ;
for
these
are things
of
intrinsic value , serving for the food of man , or else for the
uses of husbandry (c) .
the young
animals.
Of all tame and domestic animals , the brood belongs to Property in
the owner of the dam or mother ; the English law agree- of tame
ing with the civil , that " partus
sequitur
ventrem ” in the
brute creation , though for the
most part in the human
species it disallows
that
maxim .
And therefore , in the
laws of England (d) , as well as Rome (e) , " si equam meam
equus
tuus praegnantem fecerit , non
est tuum
sed
meum
quod natum
est."
And , for this
Puffendorff (ƒ) gives a
sensible reason : not only because
the male is frequently
unknown
; but also because
the dam , during
the time of
her pregnancy , is almost
useless to the
proprietor , and
must
be
maintained
with
greater
expense
and
care :
wherefore , as her owner is the loser by her pregnancy , he
ought to be the gainer by her
brood .
An exception
to
this rule is in the
case of young
cygnets ; which
belong
equally to the
owner of the
cock and hen, and shall be
divided
between them (g) .
But here the reasons of the
general
rule
cease , and " cessante
ratione
cessat
et
ipsa
lex :" for the male is well
known , by his constant
asso-
ciation
with the
female ;
and for the
same reason the
owner of the one doth not suffer more disadvantage during
the time of pregnancy and nurture , than the owner of the
other.

PROPERTY
IN THINGS
PERSONAL .
First , in ani-
mals feræ
naturæ.
1. Qualified
property per
The
second main class of animals
consists of those
which
are not of a tame
and
domestic
nature .
These
cannot
be
possessed
in
absolute
property ,
and
though
there
are some
cases , such as rooks , where their wild
habits approach near to domestication , yet , unless they be
clearly useful to man , either for the
purpose of food
or
otherwise , and their existence
is promoted by his labour ,
no injury is in law
deemed
to
arise by their destruc-
tion (h).
This leads us to the question , how far they may become
the
subject of property ;
the
answer
to
which
depends
partly upon
general
principles , and partly upon
express
declaration of law contained in acts of parliament .
First , then , a man may be invested with
a qualified , but
not an absolute , property in all creatures that are ferae
naturae , either per
industriam , propter
impotentiam ,
or
propter privilegium .
1. A qualified
property
may subsist
in
animals ferae
Industriam. naturae , per industriam
hominis : by a man's
reclaiming
and making
them tame by art , industry , and education (¿) ;
or by so confining
them within his own immediate power ,
that
they
cannot
escape
and
use their
natural liberty.
Such
are wild
deer in
a park, pheasants
or partridges
in a mew, hawks
that
are fed and
commanded by their
owner , and fish in a private pond or in trunks .
These are
no longer the property of a man , than while they continue
in his keeping
or actual
possession : but if at any time
they regain their natural
liberty , his
property
instantly
ceases ; unless they have animum revertendi , which is only
to be known
by their
usual
custom of returning (k) .

maxim which is borrowed from the civil law ( ) ; " rever-

consuetudinem
deseruerint."
The law therefore
extends
this possession farther than the mere manual occupation ;
for
a
tame
hawk , that is
pursuing
his quarry in his
owner's
presence
, though he is at liberty to go where he
pleases,
is
nevertheless
property ;
for
he has animum
revertendi.
So pigeons , that are flying at a distance from
their home (especially of the
carrier kind) , and likewise
the deer that is chased out of
a park or forest , and is
instantly pursued by the keeper or forester , all remain in
possession , and are still subject to this qualified property
in them .
But if they stray without
their
owner's know-
ledge , and do not return in the usual manner , it is then
lawful for any stranger
to take them (m ).
But if a deer,
or any wild animal reclaimed , wears
a collar
or has some
other mark upon him, and goes and returns
at his plea-
sure ; or , if a wild swan is taken , and marked and turned
loose in the river , the owner's
property in him
still con-
tinues , and
it is not lawful for any
one
else
to take
him (n) ; but otherwise , if the deer has been long absent
without returning , or the swan leaves the neighbourhood .
Bees

but , when

claimed , a man may
have a qualified
property
in them ,
by the law of nature , as well as by the civil law (0) .
And
to the same purpose , not to say in the same words with
the civil law,
speaks
Bracton (p) :
occupation , that is ,
hiving or including them , gives the property in bees ; for
though a swarm lights upon a tree, the owner of the tree
has no more property in them till he has
hived
them ,
than he has in the birds which
make their nest thereon ;
and therefore if another hives them , he shall be their pro-
prietor : but a swarm , which fly from and out of a hive ,
belong to the owner of the
hive
so long
as he can keep
them in sight, and have power to pursue them , or, which
is much the same thing, identify them : and in these cir-

PROPERTY

2. Qualified
property,
propter
impoten-
tiam
cumstances no one else
is entitled to take them .
But it
has been also said (9), that with us the only ownership
in bees is ratione soli ; and the charter of the forest (r) ,
which allows every freeman to be entitled
to the honey
found within his own woods , affords great countenance to
this doctrine , that
property may be had in bees , in con-
sideration of the property of the
soil
whereon they are
found (s).
In all these creatures, reclaimed from the wildness
of
their nature , the property is not absolute , but defeasible :
a property , that may be destroyed if they resume
their
ancient
wildness , and
are
found
at large .
For if the
pheasants
escape
from the mew , or the fishes from the
trunk , and are
seen wandering
at large
in their proper
element , they become ferae naturae again ; and
are free
and open to the first occupant
that has ability to seize
them .
But while they thus
continue a person's
qualified
or defeasible property , they are as much
under
the pro-
tection of the law, as if they were absolutely and
inde-
feasibly his .
We must bear in mind that
special
laws
have
been
made concerning
certain
birds
and
animals
falling under the legal
definition
of " game : " of these
we shall say somewhat more presently .
2. A qualified
property may also subsist with relation
to animals ferae naturae , ratione impotentiae, on account
of their own inability .
As when hawks , herons , or other
birds build in a man's trees, or coneys
or other
creatures
make their nests or burrows in his land , and have young
ones there ; he has a qualified
property in those young
ones till such time as they can fly or run away , and then
the property expires (t) : but till then , it is in some cases
trespass , and in others a criminal
offence , for a stranger

to take them away (u).
For here,
as the owner of the
land has it in his power to do what he pleases
with them ,
the law therefore vests
a property
in him of the young
ones , in the same
manner
as it
does of the

PROPERTY
IN THINGS
PERSONAL .
Personal
property
as to time of
special nature , on account of the peculiar
circumstances
of the
owner , when the thing itself
is
very
capable
of
absolute ownership .
As in case of bailment , or delivery
of goods to another
person for a particular
use ;
as to a
carrier to convey to London , to an inn-keeper to secure in
his inn, or the like.
Here there
is no absolute
property
in either the bailor or the bailee , the person delivering, or
him to whom it is delivered : for the bailor
hath
only the
right, and not the immediate
possession
;
the bailee hath
the possession
, and only a temporary right.
But it is
a
qualified
property in them
both ;
and
each of them is
entitled to an action , in
case the goods be damaged
or
taken away
the bailee on account of his immediate
pos-
session ; the bailor , because
the possession of the
bailee
is, mediately , his possession also ( ) .
So, also , in case of
goods pledged or pawned upon condition
either
to repay
money or otherwise ;
both the pledgor
and pledgee
have
a qualified , but neither
of them an absolute , property in
them
the pledgor's property is conditional , and depends
upon the performance of the condition of repayment , &c .;
and so too is that of the pledgee , which depends upon
its
non
-
performance
(a).
So the finder of
a
chattel
has the
right
of
possession
against
everybody
except the truc
owner who lost
it
(
).
But
a
servant
,
who has the
care
of
his master's goods
or
chattels
,
as
a
butler
of
plate
,
a
shepherd
of
sheep
,
and the like
,
has
not
any
property
or
possession
,
either absolute
or
qualified
,
but only
a
mere
charge
or
oversight
(c).
And having
thus distinguished
the different
degree
or
considered
quantity
of
dominion
or
property
to
which things
personal
enjoyment
are subject
,
and set forth their nature
,
we may add
a
word
or
two concerning
the time
of
their enjoyment
,
and the
number of their
owners
;
in
conformity
to
the
method
before observed
in
treating
of
the property

enjoyment.
First, as to the time of enjoyment .
By the rules of the Time of
ancient common law, there
could be no future
property ,
to take place in expectancy , created
in personal goods and
chattels ;
because , being
things
transitory , and by many
accidents subject
to be lost , destroyed , or otherwise im-
paired ,
and
the
exigencies of
trade
requiring
also
a
frequent
circulation
thereof , it would
occasion
perpetual
suits and quarrels , and put a stop to the freedom of com-
merce , if such
limitations
in remainder
were generally
tolerated and allowed .
But yet in last wills
and testa-
ments , such limitations
of personal
goods and chattels in
remainder , after a bequest for life , were permitted
(d) :
though originally that indulgence
was only shown , when
merely the use of the goods , and not the goods themselves ,
was given to the first legatee (e) ; the property being sup-
posed to
continue
all the
time
in the
executor of the
devisor .
But now that
distinction
is disregarded (f) :
and therefore , if a man , either by deed
or will , limits his
books or furniture
to A. for life, with remainder
over to
B. , this remainder is good (g) : unless , indeed , the property
is such, that
ipso
usu consumitur ;
for
instance , food or
fuel ; for then
a gift of a life
interest
in it confers
an
absolute
ownership (h).
But ,
where
an
estate
tail in .
things personal is given to the
first
or any subsequent
possessor , it vests in him the total
property , and no re-
mainder
over shall be permitted
on such a limitation (i) .
For this , if allowed , would tend to
a perpetuity ( ) :
and
therefore the law vests in him at once the entire dominion
of the goods , being
analogous
to the
fee -simple which
a
tenant in tail may acquire in a real estate .
By the aid of
trusts binding in
a court of equity , but not recognised at
law, settlements
of personalty
may be made

over the period which we have already mentioned
when
discussing
the rules
against
perpetuity (k)
as governing
the limitations of real estates ; and this is the usual mode
of settlement of personalty upon a marriage .
Next, as to the number
of owners .
Things personal
may belong to their
owners , not
only
in severalty , but
also in joint -tenancy , and in
common ,
as well
as
real
estates .
They cannot indeed be vested in co-parcenary ;
because that
ownership
is peculiar
to realty .
But if a
horse , or other personal chattel , be given to two or more ,
absolutely , they are joint -tenants hereof ; and , unless
the
jointure
be
severed ,
the
same doctrine
of survivorship
shall take place as in estates
of lands
and tenements ( ).
And , in like manner , if the jointure be
severed , as , by
either
of them
selling
his
share , the vendee and the
remaining
part -owner shall be tenants in common , with-
out any jus accrescendi or survivorship
(m).
So , also , if
1007. be given
by will to two
or
more ,
equally
to
be
divided between them , this makes them tenants in com-
mon (n) ; which , as we have formerly
seen (0), the
same
words would
have done in regard
to real
estates .
But,
for the encouragement of husbandry
and trade, it is held
that a stock on a farm , though occupied jointly , and also
a stock used in a joint undertaking
, by way of partnership
in trade , shall always be considered
as common and not
as joint
property ,
and
there
shall be no
survivorship
therein (p).

it
can have

,
except such
as
the law
,
by
the aid
of
its courts
,

will be more properly
discussed
in
that part
of
these Commentaries
in
which the
grounds

.
It
,
therefore
,
will
be
treated
of
in
the third part
of
these
Commentaries
.
We
need only here notice that personal
property may
be
assigned
by manual

,
where the
nature
of
the case admits
of
it
,
or
by deed
or
any other
suitable instrument

however
,
personal

are assigned
by deed
,
but
possession
is
not de-
livered
to
the
assignee
(
which
usually
occurs
on the
occasion
of
a
mortgage
),
the assignment
,
which
is
then
called
a

,
is
void not only
as

against the sheriff seizing the property in execution , unless
a copy of the deed has been filed in the court of queen's
bench ; moreover , the registry
so made must be renewed
every five years during the subsistence of the security (a).
And , first , a property in goods and chattels may be ac-
quired
by occupancy : which , we have more than
once (6)
remarked ,
seems
to be the original and only
primitive
method of acquiring
any property at all ; but which has
since been restrained
and abridged , by the positive
laws
of society , in order to maintain
peace and harmony among
mankind . For this purpose , by the laws of England , gifts ,
and contracts , testaments , legacies , and administrations
,
have been introduced
and countenanced , in order to trans-
fer and continue
that
property and possession in things
personal , which
has
once
been
acquired by the
owner .
And ,
where
such
things
are found
without
any other
owner , they for the most part belong to the king by virtue
of his prerogative ; except in some few instances , wherein
the original and natural right of occupancy is still , to some
extent , permitted to subsist . These , however , will require
scarcely more than a passing notice .
Thus , in the first place , it has been
said , that anybody
may seize to his own use such goods as belong to an alien
enemy (c) , upon the ground that during their enmity they
can claim
no protection from the law, and therefore any
man may , when
opportunity
offers , seize their
property
with impunity .
But this , however generally laid down by
some writers , cannot
extend beyond
such seizures as are
duly authorised by the public
authority of the state resid-
ing in the crown (d) ;
and
cannot in any case apply to
goods
belonging
to an
enemy, and in this
country
at
the time of the declaration
of war .
Such goods are not
liable to be seized (e) , and goods brought into the country

The title to goods of an enemy founded upon this right Naval
of occupancy has usually occurred by capture at sea , or in
the plunder of towns
taken by assault .
By the practice
of the law of nations , in order to vest the
property
(at
least of a ship taken at sea) in the captors
, a legal sen-
tence of condemnation
by a prize
court
is necessary (g) .
This is now the
law of England ,
and
is regulated
by
statute (h) .
The practice of permitting
privateers
to at-
tack the property of an enemy is looked upon with great
disfavour in modern times , and has been unknown
on the
part of the English during recent wars .
It is unnecessary
to enlarge upon it here.

As to booty taken
by soldiers in a campaign , it is now Captures

any is captured , which
is rare , as it is contrary to
our present
principles of carrying
on war to plunder the

possession of and sold by agents appointed
for the purpose , and the proceeds remitted to the treasurer

in the king , and form a part of the ordinary revenue of
the crown ; or belong
to grantees of the crown , lords
of
manors , and the like.
With
regard ,
likewise , to
animals
feræ
naturæ,
all
mankind
had by the original grant
of
the Creator
a
right
to
pursue and take any fowl
or
insect
of
the air
,
any fish
or
inhabitant
of
the waters
,
and any beast
or
reptile
of
the
field
and this natural right still continues
in
every indi-
vidual
,
unless where
it
is
restrained
by the civil laws of
the country
.
And when
a
man has once
so
seized them
,

The restrictions
which have been
laid
upon
this
right
,
by the laws
of
England
,
relate
principally
to
royal fish
,
as
whale and sturgeon
,
and such
terrestrial
,
aërial
,
or
aquatic
animals
as
go under the
denomination
of
game
;
the taking
of
the former
is
made
the exclusive right
of
the prince
,
and such
of
his subjects
to
whom
he has granted
the same royal
privilege
,
and
that
of
the latter
is
subject
to
special restrictions
.
We may remember
(k)
that the right
to
hunt and kill
game was
,
in
the days
of
the early Norman
kings
(if
not
earlier
),
claimed
as
a
special prerogative
of
the sovereign
,
and
of
those
to
whom he had granted the privilege
;
and
this right was not
only
claimed
,
but
it
was
,
as
is
well
known
,
enforced with
a
rigour
,
the cruelty
of
which even
exceeded
the injustice
upon which
it
rested
.
The forest laws
,
however
,
even
in
the time
of
King John
(
who had himself issued some
of
the most arbitrary
inter-
dicts
(
)),
were much
relaxed
;
and
,
indeed
,
the Carta
de
Forestâ
(
m)
(
extracted from him with
almost
as
much
difficulty
as
Magna

)
went far
to
put
an end
to them

GAME
LAWS .

but in their
place numerous statutes have been from time
to time passed , not involving
, indeed , such manifest
in-
justice
as those
laws , yet , to no inconsiderable
extent ,
founded on very similar doctrines , that the pleasures of
the chase and of sporting generally were to be reserved for
the rich .
By an early statute (n) it is ordained that " no artificer ,
labourer , or other layman which
hath not lands
or tene-
ments
to the value of 40s. by the year , nor any priest , to
the value of
107. , shall keep any dogs, nets, or engines.
to destroy deer,
hares,
or
conies,
or
other gentlemen's
game , upon pain of one year's imprisonment ."
Other
later
statutes , such
as
1 Jac.
1 , c. 27 (o) ,
pro-
hibited, with more or less generality , the killing of game ,
making exceptions in favour of those persons possessed
of
special
qualifications , such
as being
a lord
or lady of a
manor , or owners of estates
of inheritance
worth
407.
a
year, and the like.
The result of these acts was, therefore , that
only those
who possessed considerable fortunes had the right to kill
game .
But the right of these is founded upon
that ge-
neral
right which , in the absence
of any laws
on
the
subject , every person would
seem
naturally to possess
of
shooting
game , like
other wild
animals , upon his own
land, or the land of any
other person whose permission
to do so has been given him.
No statute gives any ex-
press
permission
to
an individual
to kill game,
except ,
indeed , those which permit
gamekeepers to do
so , when
duly appointed , though
not possessed
of a property qua-
lification , and these
do not so much
confer any right as
remove the penalties which previous
enactments had im-
posed (p).

(0) Which
was altered
by 7 Jac .
1, c. 11, and virtually repealed by

By the last
act the qualification
was an estate
of inheritance
worth 1007. a-year ;
or
an
estate
for
life worth 1507.

It is therefore an incorrect , though it was a common,
expression , to say that the possession of 1007.
a year , or
so forth , gave a qualification , for that possession merely
took the person having it out of the operation of the game
acts , and left him to his natural
rights .
Whether , however , we regard the so-called " qualified ”
persons as the only ones to whom permission to kill game
has been given , or whether as the only persons from whom
the
natural
birthright
of doing
so has
not
been
taken
away, the effect is the same , and involves
ideas which
are
ill
-
suited
to
the sense
of
liberty
of
the present
day
,
and
,
accordingly
,
all
"
qualifications
"
have been abolished
(q).
Every person may now kill game
,
though
of
course his
right can have no opportunity
of
exercise unless with the
permission
of the
owner
of
the
land
on
which
the
game
is
to be killed
.
The right
to
kill any particular
game
,
therefore
,
emanates from the owner of the land on
which
it
is

.
We may here note
,
however
,
that these ancient
ideas
and prejudices
as
to
the right
of
killing
game have been
put
to
a
practical use for purposes
of
the public revenue
.
Under the act which abolished qualifications
,
it
was neces-
sary for every person
who
was
about
to
kill
game
to
purchase

Bracton (2), and have since been confirmed by many reso-
lutions of the courts (a).
It has even been held , that if
one takes away and
clothes
another's
wife
or son , and
afterwards they return home , the garments
shall
cease to
be his property who provided
them , being annexed to the
person of the child or woman (b).
But in the
case
of confusion
of goods , where those of
mixture of two persons
are so intermixed , that the several portions
can be no longer
distinguished , the English
law partly
agrees
with, and
partly
differs
from , the civil . If the
intermixture
be
by
consent , it
seems
that, in
both
laws , the
proprietors
have an
interest
in
common , in
proportion
to their
respective
shares (c).
But , if
one
wilfully intermixes
his
money , corn , or hay , with that of
another
man , without
his approbation
or knowledge , or
casts gold in like manner into another's
melting
pot or
crucible , the civil law, though it gives the sole
property
of the whole to him who has not interfered
in the mix-
ture , yet allows a satisfaction to the other for what he has
so improvidently
lost (d) .
But our law, to guard against
fraud , gives the entire
property , without any account , to
him whose original dominion
is invaded , and endeavoured
to be rendered uncertain , without
his own consent (e).

or
A
SECOND method
of
acquiring
property
in
personal Title
by
pre-
chattels
is
by the king's prerogative
:
whereby
a
may accrue either
to
the crown itself
,
or
to
such
as
claim
under the title
of
the crown
;
as
by the king's grant
,
or
by prescription
,
which
supposes
an ancient grant
.
Formerly
,
tributes
,
taxes
,
and customs were payable
to
the crown by virtue
of
the
royal
prerogative
,
whatever
was their foundation
,
whether
as
inherent
in
the
crown
,
or
granted by authority
of
parliament
.
At the present
day
,
however
,
our
sovereign
derives
no
direct
personal
advantage from any tributes
,
taxes
,
or
customs
,
or
indeed
from any other
of
the ancient
sources
of
wealth given
to
or
acquired by the crown
:
inasmuch
as
all
such
acqui-
sitions
fall
into the general
funds
applied
annually
by
parliament
to
the services of the state
.
This has been
sufficiently
dealt with
in
a
former book
.
The state now derives
,
or
may derive
,
the benefit
of
these doctrines
,
which are still part
of
the law
,
and attach
to
the prerogative
;
though
they are never given
effect
to
when they work
to
the manifest
hardship
of
individuals
.
One of these doctrines
is
,
that
the king
cannot
have
a
joint
property with any person
in
one
entire
chattel
,
or
such
a
one
as
is
not capable
of
division
or
separation
;
but where the titles
of
the king and
a
subject concur
,
the
king shall have the whole
:
in
like manner
as
the king
cannot
,
either by grant
or
contract
,
become
a
joint
-
tenant
of
a
chattel real with another
person
,
but by such grant

604
TITLE
BY
PREROGATIVE
AND
FORFEITURE.
King's pro-
perty in
treasure-
trove,
wrecks,
waifs, royal
fish, &c.
or contract shall become
entitled
to the whole in severalty .
Thus , if a horse be given to the king and a private person ,
the king shall have the sole property : if a bond be made
to the king and a subject , the king shall
have the whole
penalty ; the debt
or duty being
one single
chattel (a) ;
and so , if two persons have the property of a horse between
them , or have a joint debt owing
them on bond , and one
of them assigns
his part to the king , or is
attainted ,
whereby his moiety is forfeited
to the crown ;
the king
shall have the entire horse , and entire debt ( ) .
For, as
it is not consistent with the dignity of the
crown to be
partner with a subject , so neither
does the king ever lose
his right in any instance ; but where they
interfere , his
is always
preferred to that of another
person (c) : from
which two principles
it is
a necessary consequence, that
the innocent , though
unfortunate
partner , must
lose his
share in both
the
debt and the
horse, or in any other
chattel in
the
same circumstances .
But this rule has
been relaxed in favour of commercial
interests , as it has
been
held
that
on
an
extent
against
one of
several
partners , only the beneficial
interest
of that partner
can
be taken (d).
This doctrine
has no opportunity
to take place in cer-
tain other instances of title by prerogative , that remain
to
be
mentioned
;
as
the
chattels
thereby
vested
are
originally and
solely vested in
the
crown , without
any
transfer
or derivative
assignment , either by deed or law ,
from
any former
proprietor .
Such is the acquisition
of
property
in wreck , in
goods
found jetsam , flotsam ,
or
lagan , in treasure -trove,
in waifs , in estrays ,
in
royal
fish , in
swans ,
and
the like ;
which
are
not
trans-
ferred to the
sovereign from
any former
owner , but
are
originally inherent in him by the rules of law, and are
derived to particular
subjects , as royal
franchises , by his

These are ascribed to him , partly
upon the par-
ticular reasons already
mentioned ; and partly upon the
general principle
of their being bona vacantia , and there-
fore vested in the king , as well
to preserve the
peace
of
the public, as in trust to employ them for the
safety and
ornament of the commonwealth .
The right of the crown
to wreck and goods found jetsam , flotsam , or lagan , has
been regulated by statute (e).
copyright .
There is also a kind of prerogative copyright
subsisting
Prerogative
in certain books , which is held to be vested in the crown.
upon different reasons.
Thus ,
1.
The king , as the execu-
tive magistrate , has
the
right
of promulgating
to
the
people all acts of state and government .
This gives him
the
exclusive
privilege
of printing , at his own press , or
that of his grantees , all acts of parliament , proclamations ,
and
orders of council (f) .
2. As supreme
head
of the
church , he has a right to the publication
of all liturgies ,
and books of divine service.
3. He is also
said to have a
right , by purchase , to the copies of such law-books , gram-
mars , and other compositions , as were compiled
or trans-
lated at the expense
of the crown .
And upon
these two
last principles
combined , the exclusive right of printing
the translation
of the bible
is founded (g) .
The third method whereby a title to goods and chattels

may be acquired and lost , viz . , by forfeiture , as a punish-
ment for crime , needs
here but a brief notice .
We have
already
considered
forfeitures
as a means whereby
real
property may be partially or totally forfeited .
Forfeitures.
of goods and chattels have been at various times inflicted
by special statutes for particular
crimes and misdemeanors ,
some of which were mala in se , or
offences
against
the
divine law, either natural
or revealed ;
others , and by far
the greatest part , were mala prohibita , or such

are
some others now in existence , such , for
instance , as the
penalty
of
10 %. forfeited
under the copyright
act (i) , to
the proprietor of a copyright which has been infringed (k).
The details of these cannot find a place here.
But a more
general
forfeiture
of all
the
personal
property
of an
offender has long been
inflicted in the case of the greater
crimes , such
as treason (1) , felony (m) , or præmunire (n) .
In this case the forfeiture is to the crown .
The nature of
these
offences
will appear in the fourth
book of these
Commentaries .
The forfeiture
commences from the time of conviction ,
not the time of committing
the fact , as in forfeitures
of
real property .
For chattels
are of so vague and fluctu-
ating a nature , that to affect them by any relation
back ,
would be attended with more
inconvenience than in the
case of landed estates
: and part , if not the whole of them ,
must be expended in maintaining
the delinquent , between
the time of committing
the fact and his conviction .

a fraudulent
conveyance of them , to defeat the interest
of the crown , is made void

CHAPTER XXVIII .
TITLE
BY CUSTOM .
A FOURTH
method of acquiring
property in things per-
sonal , or chattels , is by custom : whereby a right vests in
some particular
persons , either by the local usage of some
particular
place , or by the almost
general
and universal
usage of the kingdom. It were endless , should we attempt
to enumerate
all
the several kinds of special
customs
which have been held to entitle a man to a chattel interest
in different parts of the kingdom.
We had occasion ( a) to
notice
one instance , that of
heriots , where a lord of a manor , or other chief lord , is , as
we
said,
entitled
by custom to
the best live
beast,
or
averium, of which
a tenant dies
possessed , or some
other
chattel , or, as is now more usual , a payment of money in
lieu of the chattel .
The custom , originally a Danish one ,
seems to have
been , in some measure, founded upon the
voluntary
act of the tenant , the chattel being looked on as
a sort of legacy
to the
lord (b) , though
afterwards
the
bounty was of rather a forced character .
Another instance is that of mortuaries
: Mortuaries
are
a sort of ecclesiastical
heriots , being
a
customary
gift
claimed by and due to the minister in very many parishes
on the death of his parishioners (c) .
They seem originally
to have been, like lay heriots , only a voluntary
bequest to

the church ; being
intended , as
Lyndewode
informs
us ,
from a constitution
of Archbishop
Langham , as a kind of
expiation and amends to the clergy for the personal tithes ,
and other ecclesiastical
duties , which
the laity in their
lifetime
might have neglected or forgotten
to pay .
For
this purpose , after (d) the lord's
heriot or best good was
taken
out, the
second best chattel
was
reserved to the
church
as a mortuary
: " si decedens plura
habuerit ani-
malia, optimo
cui de jure fuerit debitum
reservato , ecclesiæ
suce sine dolo, fraude , seu contradictione quâlibet, pro re-
compensatione
subtractionis decimarum personalium , necnon
et
oblationum ,
secundum
melius
animal
reservetur ,
post
obitum , pro salute
animæ
suæ (e).
And , therefore , in the
laws of King Canute (f) , this mortuary is called soul - scot ,
or symbolum animæ.
It was anciently
usual
in this kingdom
to bring the
mortuary to church
along with the corpse when it came.
to be buried ; and
thence (g) it is
sometimes
called
a
corse-present :
a term which
indicates
that it once
was
a voluntary
donation .
However , in
Bracton's
time ,
so
early as Henry III . , we find it rivetted into an established
custom
insomuch
that the bequests
of heriots and mor-
tuaries
were
held
to be
necessary ingredients
in every
testament of chattels . " Imprimis autem debet quilibet, qui
testamentum
fecerit , dominum suum
de
meliori
re quam
habuerit recognoscere ; et postea ecclesiam
de alia meliori :"
the lord must have the best good left him as an heriot ;
and the church the second best as
a mortuary .
But yet
this custom was different in different places : " in quibus-
dam locis habet ecclesia
melius animal
de consuetudine
; in
quibusdam secundum
, vel tertium melius ;
et in quibusdam
nihil : et ideo consideranda
est consuetudo
loci " (h).
This
custom still varies in different places, not only as the mor-
tuary to be paid , but the person to whom it is payable.

statute 12 Ann . st. 2, c. 6.
And in the archdeaconry of
Chester , a custom
also
prevailed , that the bishop , who
was also archdeacon, should
have, at the death of every
clergyman
dying therein , his best horse or mare , bridle ,
saddle, and spurs, his best gown or cloak , hat, upper gar-
ment under his gown , and tippet , and also his best signet
or ring (i).
But by statute 28 Geo . 2 , c. 6 , this mortuary
was directed to cease , and the act has settled upon the

many goods, on the death of all prelates in England , seems
to be of the same nature ; though
sir Edward Coke (k)
apprehends , that this is a duty due upon death, and not a
mortuary : a distinction which seems to be without a dif-
ference.
For not
only the
king's
ecclesiastical
cha-
racter, as supreme
ordinary , but also the
species of the
goods claimed , which
bear so near a resemblance to those
in the archdeaconry of Chester , which was
an acknow-
ledged mortuary , puts the matter
out of dispute .
The
king, according to the record
vouched by Sir
Edward
Coke , is entitled to six things : the bishop's best horse or
palfrey , with his furniture ; his cloak , or gown , and tippet ;
his cup, and cover ; his bason and ewer ; his gold ring ;

And upon this statute stands the law of mor-
tuaries to this day.
The instance of this kind of title , which is perhaps the
most interesting
because
the most familiar to us by name ,
is that of heir -looms .
Heir -looms are such goods and personal
chattels , as,
Heir -loons .
contrary to the nature of chattels , go by special custom to
the heir along with the inheritance , and not to the execu-
tor of the last
proprietor .
The
termination , loom , is of
Saxon
origin ; in which
language it signifies
a limb or
member ; so that an heir -loom is nothing
else but a limb
or member of the inheritance .
They are generally such
things as cannot be taken away without
damaging
or dis-
membering
the freehold :
otherwise the general
rule
is ,
that no chattel
interest whatsoever
shall
go to the heir,
notwithstanding
it be expressly limited
to a man and his
heirs , but it is his absolute property , and in default of his
dealing with it during
his life, it goes to his executor or
administrator
.
If a gift of a chattel
be made to A. and the heirs male
of his body , or by any other expression which , in the case
of land, would
create
an
estate
tail, it vests in him
the
absolute
property .
It is not uncommon for testators to
desire to make
personal property , such
as leaseholds
or
family plate
or jewels , go in strict
settlement , together
with thefamily mansion , or sometimes to have them handed
down from generation to generation , as if they were heir-

BY CUSTOM.
Charters,
looms , even when there is no family estate.
Since , how-
ever , heir -looms , properly
so called , exist as such only by
custom , such desires can only be partially fulfilled . Various
devices have been contrived
to keep the settlement
alive
as long as possible .
The
ordinary
limitations which are
applied to land would vest the property absolutely in the
first tenant -in -tail ;
and
on his
death ,
even if he died
the moment after his birth , the property would go , not to
the next remainderman in the settlement , but to his repre-
sentatives . The usual method , then , which is now adopted
in these cases , is to add
a declaration
that the property
shall go over if the tenant - in -tail dies under twenty -one
years of age .
This declaration
operates as an executory
bequest, and if it be limited
so as not to contravene the
rules against
perpetuity (1) , it will have its effect
so as to
prevent the representatives of a tenant -in-tail who dies in
infancy from becoming entitled .
The chattels in such cases are not heir -looms , property
so called , which do not depend on the term of a gift , but
upon custom .
Instances
of true heir-looms
are the fol-
lowing : Deer in a real , authorised
park , whilst wild (m) ,
fishes in
a pond , doves
in
a dove- house, &c. , though
in
themselves
personal
chattels , yet are
so annexed to , and
so necessary to the well-being of the inheritance , that they
accompany the land wherever it vests, by either
descent
or purchase (n).
For this reason , also , the ancient jewels
of the crown
may be considered to be heir -looms ( 0) ; for
they are necessary to maintain
the state, and support the
dignity, of the sovereign for the time being .
And so an
ancient horn , when land is held by tenure of cornage, may
be an heir -loom ( p).

they are contained (q) , pass together with
the land to the heir , in the nature of heir -looms , and do
not go to the executor (r) .
By special custom , also , in
in
some
places , carriages , utensils , and other household
implements , may be heir-looms (s) ; but such custom must
be strictly proved .

custom , whatever

damage , " quod ab

become
a member of the inheritance , and
shall
thereupon
pass
to the
heir ;
as
chimney -pieces ,
pumps , old
fixed
or dormant
tables , benches, and the
like (u).
It has,
indeed , been thought
that
only
such
things
as these and other ponderous chattels can be heir-
looms (x).
Heir -looms , properly
so called , are , with
the
exception of title -deeds , very rare.
&c.
Other personal chattels there are, which also descend to Monuments,
the heir in the nature of heir -looms , as a monument
or
tombstone , in a church (y),
or the
coat-armour
of his
ancestor there
hung up, with
the
pennons
and
other
ensigns of honour , suited
to his
degree .
In
this
case ,
although the freehold of the church
is in the parson , and
these are annexed to that freehold , yet neither the parson
nor any other can take them away or deface
them , but is
liable to an action from the heir (≈) .
Formerly heir-looms
could
not be devised away from
the heir , unless the land to which by custom they were
annexed
were
also
devised ,

CHAPTER XXIX.
TITLE
BY SUCCESSION
AND
MARRIAGE
.
IN the present chapter we shall take into consideration
two other species of title
to goods
and chattels , —those by
succession and marriage .
succession.
Title by succession , in strictness of law, is only appli- Title by
cable to corporations
aggregate of many ,
as
dean
and
chapter , mayor and commonalty , master and fellows , and
the like ; in which
one set of men
may , by succeeding
another set, acquire a property in all the goods , moveables ,
and other chattels of the corporation .
The true reason of
this is, because
in judgment
of law a corporation
never
dies ; and, therefore , the predecessors
, who lived a century
ago, and their successors
now in being , are
one
and the
same body corporate (a) .
Which identity is a property so
inherent in the nature of a body politic , that , even when
it is meant to give any thing to be taken in succession by
such a body , that succession need
not be expressed
: but
the law will of itself imply it.
So that a gift to such a
corporation , either of lands or of chattels , without
naming
their
successors
, vests an absolute
property
in them
so
long as the corporation subsists (6) .
And thus a lease for
years, an obligation , a jewel , a flock
of sheep , or other
chattel interest , will vest in the
successors
, by succession,
as well
as in
the identical
members , to whom it was
originally given .
But , with regard
to sole corporations ,
a considerable Distinction

.
asto sole
corpora-
tions.
distinction
must be made.
For , if such sole corporation
be the representative
of a number
of persons ;
as
the
master of an hospital , who is a corporation for the benefit
of the poor brethren ; an abbot , or prior, by the old law
before the reformation , who represented the whole
con-
vent ; or the dean of some
ancient
cathedral , who stands
in the place of, and represents in his corporate
capacity
the chapter ;
such sole corporations
as these have , in this
respect, the same powers as corporations aggregate have ,
to take personal property or chattels in succession .
And ,
therefore , a bond to such a master , abbot , or dean , and
his
successors , is good in law ;
and the successor
shall
have the advantage of it, for the benefit of the aggregate
society , of which he is
in law
the
representative
(c).
Whereas , in the case of sole corporations , which represent
no others but themselves , as
bishops , parsons , and
the
like , no chattel
interest
can regularly
go in succession :
and , therefore , if a lease for years be made to the bishop
of Oxford and his
successors
, in such
case his executors
or administrators
, and not his successors
, shall have it (d) .
For , the word successors
, when applied to a person in his
political capacity , is equivalent
to the word
heirs
in his
natural
; and as such a lease for years , if made to John
and his heirs , would not vest in his heirs but his execu-
tors ; so ifit be made to John bishop of Oxford
and his
successors , who are the heirs of his body politic , it shall
still vest in his executors and not in such his successors
.
The reason of this is obvious : for , besides that the law
looks upon goods and chattels as of too low and perishable
a nature to be limited either to heirs , or such successors
as are equivalent
to heirs ; it would
also follow, that , if
any such chattel
interest
(granted
to a sole
corporation
and his successors
) were allowed
to descend to such suc-
cessor , the property thereof must be in abeyance from the
death of the present
owner until

pointed :- and this is contrary
to the nature of a chattel
interest , which
can never
be in abeyance or without
an
owner (e) ;
but
a man's
right
therein , when
once
sus-
pended , is gone for ever .
This is not the case in corpo-
rations aggregate , where the right is never in suspense
;
nor in the other sole corporations
before mentioned , who
are rather to be considered as heads of an aggregate body ,
than subsisting
merely in their own right : the chattel
interest , therefore , in such a case , is really and substan-
tially vested in the hospital , convent , chapter , or other
aggregate body ; though the head is the visible
person in
whose name every act is carried
on , and in whom every
interest is therefore said
(in point of form ) to vest.
But
the general rule , with regard to corporations merely sole ,
is this , that no chattel
can go to or be acquired by them
in right of succession (f).

is, where , by a particular
custom ,
some particular corporations

taking particular
chattel interests in succession.
And this
custom , being against the general
tenor of the common
law, must be strictly interpreted , and not extended to any

for the benefit of the orphan's
fund (k) : but it will not
follow from thence , that he has a capacity to take a lease
for years to himself and his
successors
for the same pur-
pose ; for the
custom extends
not to that :
nor that he
may take
a bond to himself and his
successors
, for any
other purpose than the benefit of the orphan's fund
; for
that also is not warranted by the custom .
The next method of acquiring
property in goods
and
chattels
is by marriage ;
whereby
those chattels , which
belonged formerly to the wife , are by act of law vested in
the husband , with the same degree
of property , and with
the same powers , as the wife , when sole , had over them .
In view of approaching changes in this head of law, we
need be but very brief ( ) .
And we may call to mind that,
by the aid of trustees , acting
subject to the control of the
Court of Chancery , the whole
theory has long been, to a
great extent , in operation among the richer
classes .
The
following
outline will therefore be sufficient here.
A distinction
is taken between chattels real and chattels
personal , and of chattels
personal , whether in possession
,
or reversion , or in action .
A
chattel
real vests in the
husband , not absolutely , but sub modo .
As , in case of a
lease for years , the husband shall
receive all the rents and
profits
of it, and
may , if he
pleases , sell , surrender , or
dispose of it during the coverture (m) : if he be outlawed
or attainted , it shall be forfeited
to the king (n) ; it is
liable to execution
for his debts (o) ; and , if he
survives
his wife , it is to all
intents
and purposes his own (p).
Yet , if he has made no disposition
thereof in his lifetime ,
and dies before his wife , he cannot dispose of it by will(9) :
for, the husband having made no alteration in the property
during his
life , it never was transferred
from the wife ;
but after his death
she shall remain in her ancient pos-

And upon such receipt or recovery, they

so that , at his death , they still continue

they shall survive

a term
borrowed from the civil law ( u) , and is derived from

CHAPTER
XXX.
TITLE
BY BANKRUPTCY.
In the present chapter we are led to consider a mode of
transferring
property which
has occupied the attention of
the courts and the legislature
in late years in a remarkable
degree. In a former chapter we touched lightly upon this
method of acquiring title to lands by bankruptcy ; we there
deferred any discussion of details .
The title to personal
property
and to real property
under
the bankrupt
laws
stand upon very much the same footing .
Therefore the
short outline which we purpose to give in this chapter will
constitute the completion of the subject which was opened
in the former chapter .
referenceto
When we consider
persons in reference to their
pe- Classifi
cuniary
contracts
which
they
make
with
others ,
we personswith
naturally
are led to divide
them into two main classes-- their pecu-
niary ob-
those of traders and non -traders- the distinction
between ligations.
which is pretty obvious :
even though , in some instances ,
individuals may occupy a position
so near the boundary-
line, that it is not
easy
to
determine
on which
side it
lies .
In general , however, the division
is broad enough .
Persons who " buy and sell " and " use the trade of mer-
chandize " clearly are led to contract numerous obligations
of a more varied character than other men ; such , indeed ,
as do not naturally
arise with other men .
When , there-
fore, we consider
these in connection with their state of
indebtedness ,
we are
led
to
regard
them
with
some-
what
different
ideas
from those
with which we look
upon other persons .
If a gentleman , or one in a liberal
profession , at the time of contracting
his
debts , has a
sufficient
fund
to
pay them , the
delay of payment
is
a
species
of dishonesty , and a temporary
injustice
to his
creditor
and if, at such time , he has no sufficient fund ,


622
TITLE
BY BANKRUPTCY
.
the dishonesty and injustice
are the greater .
He cannot ,
therefore , murmur , if he suffers the punishment
which he
has voluntarily drawn upon himself.
But in mercantile
transactions
the
case is far otherwise .
Trade
cannot be
carried
on
without mutual
credit
on both
sides :
the
contracting
of
debts
is ; therefore , here
not
only
jus-
tifiable , but
necessary
.
And if by accidental
calamities ,
as, by the
loss of a ship in a tempest , the failure of
brother
traders , or by the
non -payment
of persons
out
of trade, a merchant or trader becomes incapable of dis-
charging
his own debts, it is his misfortune
and not his
fault .
Our law has always
adopted
, and still
adopts , the dis-
tinction
between
traders
and
non -traders , though
the
distinction
has now far less effect than used to be the
case .
Formerly, indeed , the difference between the treat-
ment of the two classes was of the most marked character ;
for, although the consequences
of being unable to pay his
debts were made sufficiently
severe , or even , we may say ,
harsh , to an unfortunate
trader , they were absolutely cruel
to all others .
The course of opinion
and of legislation
has , however,
gone through many successive phases ; there has been a
gradual
softening
of feeling
towards
debtors , until
the
result has been , that under the law recently in force there
is in practice
scarcely any harshness
at all , even where
the debtor has been guilty of considerable recklessness of
conduct .
In early times the prominent
idea with our legislature
was that of punishing
those who recklessly incurred
debts
without reasonable
hopes
of paying
them .
Of late the
tendency
of the law has been to relieve them
from
all
consequences
of so doing .
Formerly (and in the
case of
non -traders until very recent times ) a poor
debtor lan-
guished all his life in a miserable
prison ; now imprison-
ment for any ordinary debt no longer exists (a)
(a) See the Debtors ' Act, 1869,
32 & 33 Vict . c. 62.
Imprisonment
may still be inflicted
in a few cases,
specially
mentioned
in the act .


LAW
OF BANKRUPTCY.
623
We may remember
the similar phases, ranging , how-
Roman law.
ever , between still greater extremes , through which Roman
law passed , from the savage law of the Twelve
Tables ,
which
consigned
a defaulting
debtor to death or foreign
slavery , by which , indeed , if we accept , with Gibbon , the
literal
interpretation
, the creditors
had a right to cut the
debtor's body into
pieces , each taking his
proportionable
share (6),
down
to the merciful
law of
cession , under
which , if a debtor ceded , or yielded
up all his fortune to Cessio
his
creditors , he was
secured from
being
dragged
to a
gaol , " omni quoque
corporali
cruciatu
semoto " (c) .
For,
as the
emperor justly
observes
(d), " inhumanum
erat
spoliatum fortunis suis in solidum damnari ."
With the
Romans ,
indeed , the
opposite
extreme
to
harshness was reached, for , by a still later law (e) , we find
it enacted , that , if the debtor , by any unforeseen accident ,
was reduced to low circumstances , and would
swear that
he had not sufficient left to pay his debts , he should not
be compelled to
cede
or give
up even that which he had
in his possession : a law which , under
a false notion of
humanity ,
seems
to be fertile
of perjury , injustice , and
absurdity .

found to escape , it seems that the wise course of legisla-
tion has as its chief aim, to put an early end to
those
disastrous or reckless
careers
which
result in bankruptcy ,
and thus to
secure
as
small
a loss
as is possible .
The
other object of a bankrupt
law is to provide
machinery ,
when once the stroke has fallen , and a debtor has become
a bankrupt, for the purpose of realizing
and distributing
his
assets
amongst
his creditors
with as little
loss
and
delay as is possible .
We cannot here follow the history of all the numerous
measures which
have
been
adopted with
these
objects ,
more or less , in view . It is sufficient here to say, that for
a long time all bankruptcy
acts were confined in their
operation to traders only .
Persons who were not traders
were left to the ordinary
course of law, and could only get
rid of the burden of their debts by paying
them , and no
means existed for an enforced distribution
of their
estates .
And the
earliest
relief that was afforded
to them was
merely to give
them
means of freeing
themselves
from
action
or other legal
proceedings , their
future
acquired
property being , however , made applicable
to payment of
their debts (ƒ).
This distinction
between the two classes of debtors was
first broken into by the act of 1861 (g) , by which all per-
sons were made liable to become
bankrupt (h).
And now ,
under the act which will henceforth
regulate
this branch
of our law, the distinction
is only retained in a few parti-
culars , where
the circumstance
that
a man is
a trader
indicates
somewhat
different
duties
and relations
on his
(f) The first act for the relief of
insolvent
debtors was 32 Geo . 2, c.
123, relating
to debtors under 1007.
It was extended by 33 Geo. 3, c. 5,
to 3007.
Numerous
temporary mea-
sures
followed ,
and
a
permanent
system , such
as mentioned
in the
text, adopted by 1 & 2 Vict . c. 110.

before the passing of
the
act , s. 90, which exception
is
continued
by the Bankruptcy
Act,
1869, s. 118, so that a non -trader
cannot

made
a bankrupt

creditor
who
became such

part in regard to other members of the community .
The
machinery , as much as the spirit of the law, has changed
during the three centuries and a half that
bankrupt
laws
have existed (i).
The later acts have been framed princi-
pally with the view of creating
some means of inexpen-
sively winding up a bankrupt
estate . Yet in practice their
provisions
have not been found
much
more beneficial to
creditors , even in this respect , than the older forms of pro-
ceeding .
Inasmuch
as the
present
and all
preceding
laws and
rules of bankruptcy will cease
to have any operation
or
effect upon the 1st Jan. , 1870 , and the present courts of
bankruptcy will then cease to exist , we deem it unneces-
sary here to dwell upon either the principles of the existing
law , or the mode in which
those
principles
are
put into
practice under the acts now in force (k). It is sufficient to
say, that experience has shown that under those laws too
great facilities
have been
afforded
to debtors to discharge
themselves of thejust obligations which they have incurred ,
whilst too great difficulties
have been felt by creditors in
obtaining
a fulfilment
of their just wishes for the fair and
equal division
amongst them of their
debtor's
property .
By the Bankruptcy
Act,
1861 , it was for the first time
made possible for a man by direct means ( 1) to make him-
self a bankrupt .
This privilege , which has been made use
of to a most unexpected extent , has proved to be unsatis-
factory in its operation , and will , from the commencement
of the act of 1869 , no longer exist .

All persons
liable to be
had in view in framing the recent act have been to secure
:
first , that a distribution
of a debtor's
property should be
made amongst his creditors with as little expense
as is pos- -
sible ; and secondly (by making the consequences
of a great
deficiency of assets somewhat severe to the bankrupt) , that
the career of an unfortunate
or reckless
person
may be
put a stop to at
as early a period
as may be practically
attainable .
Yet the legislature
has not been regardless
of the necessity for compelling
persons , who
enter
into
engagements which
may result
in their inability
to pay
their debts , to observe
a strict attention to honesty .
For
by the act (m), which
abolishes (with
a few exceptions )
imprisonment
for debt , it is
enacted , that any
person
adjudged
bankrupt , and
any
person
whose
affairs
are
liquidated
by arrangement
pursuant
to the
Bankruptcy
Act , 1869 , shall , in each of the
cases
there specified , be
held
criminally
responsible ,
and
punished
accordingly .
The
cases
are principally where the bankrupt
has com-
mitted those fraudulent
acts which
the pressure of insol-
vency commonly tempts men to commit .
We will now give a short
account of the provisions
of
the new act (32 & 33 Vict. c. 71).

When the whole of the property has been realised for
the benefit of the creditors , or as much of it as in the
opinion of the trustee
or the committee
can be realised
without needlessly
protracting
the bankruptcy , a report
is made to the court ; and if the court

CHAPTER XXXI.
TITLE
BY
TESTAMENT
AND
ADMINISTRATION
.
There yet remain to be examined , in the present chapter,
two other methods of acquiring
personal
estates , viz. by
testament (a) and administration
.
And these we propose
to consider in one and the same view ; they being in their
nature so connected
and blended
together ,
as makes it
impossible
to treat of them distinctly , without manifest
tautology and repetition .
In the pursuit, then , of this joint subject , we will , first ,
inquire shortly into the origin and antiquity of testaments
and administrations
; secondly , show who is capable of
making
a last will and testament ; thirdly , consider the
nature of a testament
and its incidents ; fourthly , show
what an executor and administrator
are , and how they are
to be appointed ;
and ,
lastly,
select some few of the
general
heads of the
office
and
duty
of
executors
and
administrators
.
There is no question
that testaments
are of very high
antiquity , though ,
as
we have
seen , wills dealing
with
real estate in England have not been invariably
admitted
by our law.
The power of directing
who shall be the pos-
sessors
of a
person's
moveables ,
after
his
death, to a
limited extent
at least , has
been
nearly universal
among
civilized
nations ,
and the law of every well-regulated
(a) The word " will ," ultima vo-
luntas in scriptis , is now properly
applicable
to
real
estate ; " testa-
ment " being the appropriate
word
for "personalty" (Co. Litt. 111 a).
The two words are however , in sub-
stance, the same.
Testament
has
been
defined
as
testatio
mentis
(Inst.
2.

hardly a derivation .


HISTORY
OF
TESTAMENTS
AND
ADMINISTRATIONS
.
society (b) has made provision
as to the persons in whom
the goods
are to vest in the
absence of such direction , or
so far as such direction may not or does not extend .
The
former method of acquiring
personal
property , according
to the express directions of the
deceased , we call a testa-
ment : the
latter , which
is also according
to the will of
the deceased , not expressed
, indeed , but presumed by the
law (c) , we call in England an administration
; being the
same which the civil lawyers term a succession ab intestato ,
and which
answers to the
descent or inheritance of real
estates .
There seems ample evidence that the Jews in the earliest
times exercised this right of testamentary disposition (d ).
Among the
Greeks , also ,
at
Athens
at
least , it
was
permitted , having
been
introduced
by Solon (e) , though
in other parts of Greece it was discountenanced (ƒ).
Amongst the Romans in ancient times a member of the
comitia curiata could , by a kind of special law, passed at
his
personal
instance , alter
the
devolution
of
his
pro-
perty (g) .
Plebeians
effected
a like object by an indirect
method of a pretended sale ( per
æs
et libram ) , a proceed-
ing afterwards
countenanced by the Laws of the Twelve
Tables ( ).
Subsequently , by the prætorian
law and the
imperial constitutions , simple testaments became
permis-
sible ; to be made, however , with considerable formalities ,
such as , amongst others , the presence of seven witnesses (i).
Amongst the Germans , however , they do not seem to have
been in use (k).
And this variety
may
serve
to evince,
that the right of making wills , and disposing of property
after death , is merely a creature of the civil state (1) ; which

Testamen-
and , even where it is
permitted
by law, it is subjected
to
different formalities
and restrictions in almost every nation
under heaven (m ).
With us in England this power of bequeathing is coeval
in England. with the first rudiments of the law : for we have no traces
tary power
or memorials of any time when it did not exist .
Mention
is made of intestacy , in the old law before the conquest ,
as being
merely accidental ;
and the
distribution
of the
intestate's
estate , after payment
of the lord's
heriot , is
then directed
to go
according
to the
established
law .
" Sive quis incuriâ ,
sive
morte
repentinâ , fuerit
intestatus
mortuus,
dominus

nullam
rerum
suarum
partem
(præter eam quae jure debetur hereoti
nomine ) sibi assumito .
Verum possessiones
uxori , liberis ,
et
cognatione
proximis ,
pro suo cuique jure, distribuantur " (n).
But we are not to
imagine that this power of bequeathing extended originally
to all a man's
personal
estate .
On the contrary , Glanvil
will inform us (0) , that by the common law, as it stood in
the reign of Henry II. , a man's
goods were to be divided
into three equal parts ; of which one went to his heirs or
lineal descendants
, another to his wife , and the third was
at his own disposal
: or , if he died without
a wife , he might
then dispose of one moiety , and the other went to his chil-
dren ; and
so
e converso , if he had no children , the wife
was entitled
to one moiety , and he might bequeath the
other ; but, if he died without either wife
or issue , the
Reasonable Whole was at his own
disposal ( p) .
The
shares of the
widow and wife and children were called their reasonable parts
; and
the writ de rationabili
parte bonorum was given to recover
them (q).
parts of
children .
This continued
to be the law of the land at the time of
magna carta , which
provides , that the king's debts shall
first of all be levied , and then the residue of the goods

In
the
reign
of king
Ed-
ward III. this right of the wife and children was still held
to be the universal
or common law (s) ; though frequently
pleaded
as the local
custom of Berks , Devon , and other
counties (t)
and
sir
Henry
Finch
lays
it
down
ex-
pressly (u) , in the reign of Charles I. , to be the general
law of the land .
But this law is at present altered by Power to
imperceptible
degrees, and the deceased
may now , by will , will the
bequeath the whole of his goods and chattels ; though we personal
cannot trace out when first this alteration began .
Indeed , testator
sir Edward
Coke (x) is of opinion , that this never was the
general
law, but only
obtained in
particular
places by
special
custom
and to establish that doctrine , he relies
on a passage in Bracton , which , in truth , when compared
with the context , makes directly against his opinion .
For
Bracton (y) lays down the doctrine of the reasonable part
to be the common law ; but mentions that as a particular
exception , which sir Edward
Coke has hastily cited for the
general rule .
And Glanvil , magna carta , Fleta , the year-
books , Fitzherbert, and Finch seem to agree with Bracton
that this right to the pars rationabilis
was by the common
law ( ).

But whatever
was
the
common
law throughout
the
kingdom , this at least is certain , that until comparatively
modern times , in certain
places , particularly
in the pro-
vince of York, the principality of Wales , and the city of
London , a restriction
upon the testamentary power of dis-
position was by custom imposed upon testators in favour
of their wives and children , which , in fact , continued until
abolished by statute (a).
These common law or customary
restrictions
now
no-
where exist : absolute power of disposition
by testament
over all his personal property is
possessed
by everybody
who is not under personal disability (b) .
In case a person made no disposition of such of his goods
as were testable , whether that were only part or , as is now
the
case , the whole of them, he was , and is, said to die
intestate ; and in such cases , it is said , that by the old law
the king was entitled to seize upon his goods , as the parens
patriæ , and general trustee of the kingdom
(c). This pre-
rogative the king continued to exercise for some
time by
his own ministers
of justice ; and probably in the county
court , where matters of all kinds
were determined
; and it
was granted as a franchise
to many lords of manors , and
others , who had , till very recently , a prescriptive
right to
grant administration
to their intestate tenants and suitors ,
in their own courts baron , and other courts , or to have
their wills there proved , in case
they made any disposi-
tion (d).
Afterwards
the crown , in favour of the church ,
invested the prelates with this branch of the prerogative :
which was done, says Perkins (e) , because it was intended
by the law, that spiritual men are of better conscience than
laymen , and that
they had more knowledge what things

would conduce to the benefit of the soul of the deceased (ƒ) .
The goods , therefore , of intestates were given to the ordi-
nary by the crown ; and he might seize them , and keep
them without wasting , and also might give , aliene , or sell
them at his will, and dispose of the money in pios usus :
and if he did otherwise , he broke the confidence which the
law reposed in him ( g) .
So that , properly , the whole in-
terest and power which were granted to the ordinary , were
only those of being the king's almoner within his diocese
;
in trust to distribute the intestate's goods in charity to the
poor , or in such superstitious
uses
as the mistaken
zeal of
the times had denominated pious (h). And , as he had thus
the disposition
of intestates ' effects , the probate of wills of
course followed
: for it was thought just and natural , that
the will of the deceased
should be proved to the satisfac-
tion of the prelate , whose right of distributing
his chattels
for the
good of his
soul
was
effectually
superseded
thereby .
The goods of the intestate being thus vested in the ordi-
nary upon the most
solemn
and conscientious
trust , the
reverend
prelates were , therefore , not accountable to any ,
but to God and themselves , for
their
conduct (2).
But
even in Fleta's time it was complained (k), " quod ordi-
narii, hujusmodi bona
nomine
ecclesiæ
occupantes , nullam
vel saltem indebitam faciunt distributionem ."
And to what
a length of iniquity this abuse was carried , most evidently
appears from a gloss of Pope
Innocent IV. () , written
about the year
1250
; wherein
he lays it down for esta-
blished
canon
law,
that " in
Britannia
tertia
pars
bonorum
decedentium
ab intestato
in opus ecclesiæ
et pau-
perum dispensanda est."

the whole residue of the deceased's
estate , after the partes
rationabiles , or two -thirds , of the wife
and children
were
deducted ; without
paying
even his lawful debts , or other
charges
thereon .
This , however , was in excess
of their
rights ; for we find that
in
Snelling's
case ( n ) it was re-
solved that the
ordinary , if he took
possession of the
intestate's
goods , was chargeable with his debts at com-
mon law.
The
statute Westminster
2 (0) , which made a
declaration
to this
effect , was only confirmatory
of the
common law, but
probably was effective in enforcing
its
observation
.
But
,
though
they were now made liable
to
the
creditors
of
the intestate
for their just
and lawful
demands
;
yet
the
residuum
,
after
payment
of
debts
,
remained still in their
hands
,
to
be applied
to
whatever
purposes the conscience
of
the ordinary
should

more persons were in the

his election to

Thus stood the general law of probate and administra-
tion till the act we have mentioned
was
passed .
That
act (q) abolished
the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical and
all
other
courts
then
existing (r) to grant
probate of
wills or letters of administration
of the personal
estates
of intestates .
A new court was
established ,
called the
court of probate , which
now exclusively
exercises
in the
name of Her
Majesty
every jurisdiction , and performs
all duties
relating
to the personal
estates
of deceased
persons , formerly
exercised or performed by the preroga-
tive
court of Canterbury , or by the ordinaries , or other
courts : with, however , this exception , as to jurisdiction ,
that no suits for legacies or for distribution
of residue are
to be entertained .
The act abolished all the jurisdiction
of the old ecclesiastical and other courts , but did not confer
upon the new court any jurisdiction over the administra-
tion of the
estates ;
which , indeed , is one of the chief
functions of the court of chancery .
With respect to the inquiries , who may make a testa-
ment , and
how it is to be made, the present law
has
already been pretty fully stated (s), inasmuch
as the same
rules now govern the capacity to make , and the mode of
making , testaments of personal
estates , as wills of real

cases , such as the

the

being , however , the court in which the validity of the will
is tried .
Of the procedure in this court , more will appear
in the third book of these
Commentaries .
An exception
exists , however , as to the capacity of a
married woman to make a will for the purpose of appoint-
ing an executor to continue the personal representation of
a
testator , of whose will she is the
sole
or surviving
executor ( u).
This she may do without
the concurrence or
consent of her husband .
She may , indeed , make
a will
of her personal
estate , but it must be made with the con-
sent of her
husband , and
then
is rather
his will than
hers (v).
If, however , her husband
is banished by act of
parliament , or, it is said , if he have abjured the realm (x),
(if that be possible (y) ) , her capacity to make a will sur-
vives .
And a deserted wife , who has obtained a protection
order under the act 20 & 21 Vict .
c. 85,

would seem (z) , make a testamentary
disposition
of all
property acquired by her after the date of the order .

the consent of her lord (a).

ment to a will , or an addition
made by the testator , and
annexed to , and to be taken
as part of,
a testament :
being for its explanation , or alteration , or to make some
addition
to , or else
some
subtraction
from , the
former
dispositions of the testator .
A few remarks upon the question what
local law ought
to determine the validity and construction of a will , or the
devolution of property on intestacy may here find a place.
A will of fixed
or immoveable
property
is generally
governed by the lex loci rei sita (b) . In regard to personal
property , however , other considerations clearly apply .
As
to moveables , the lex loci domicilii
seems proper to prevail
as to the validity and
construction
of the will and the
devolution of the property , though
the forum will neces-
sarily be that loci rei sitæ .
In those countries , such as France , where the law does
not permit the exercise of unrestricted
testamentary dis-
position some difficulty arises in applying this principle , and
special provisions
are accordingly made by French
law (c) .
The law of England being in no difficulty of this
sort ,
adopts without
reserve the rule that a will , whether of an
Englishman or a foreigner , shall be
admitted
as valid , if
made according to the law of the place where the testator
was domiciled
at the time of making
his will and of his
death .
What that domicil
is , in any particular
case , often
is a question of very considerable difficulty (d) ; but , when
ascertained , it is decisive as to what law ought to be con-
sulted both as to the validity
and construction of the will.
Difficulties
, however , have arisen , the solution of which
by no means presents itself readily
;
as ,
e.g. , where the
testator has changed his domicil
after making his will , or

to the law of the
country where it was
made, the testator
having
at the
time
his
domicil

With
regard
to wills of
personal
estate
made by British
subjects , such questions
have to some extent been set at rest by a recent act (e) ,
whereby it is declared
that
every
such will made
out
of the
United Kingdom (whatever may be the domicil
of the testator
at the
time
of making the
same,
or
at the time of his
or her
death) shall , as
regards per-
sonal estate,
be held to be well
executed
for
the
pur-
pose
of being
admitted in England and Ireland to pro-
bate,
and in
Scotland
to
confirmation , if the
same
be
made according to the form required , either by the law of
the place where the same was made, or by the law of the
place where such person was domiciled
when
the
same
was made, or by the laws then in force in that part of Her
Majesty's
dominions where he had his domicil
of origin .
And (ƒ) every will made within the United Kingdom is
to be held to be well executed
, as regards personal estate ,
if executed according to the forms required by the laws in
force in that part of the United Kingdom where it was
made.
Moreover , a change of domicil
is not to affect the
validity of any will (g).
We will now consider what is an executor , and what an

administrator
, and how they are both to be appointed .
An executor is he to whom
another
man
commits by
will the execution of that his
last will and testament , so
far as regards
his
personal
estate .
And all persons are
capable of being executors , that are capable of making
wills , and
many
others
besides ;

This was a question

whether , if a

afterwards
changed his domicil , the
will remained

But if the testator makes an incomplete

of
her personal effects is unquestionable , and has been recog-
nised by parliament
(r) , although
the foundation
on which
it rests has been variously
stated (s) .
But the husband of a deceased
wife who has obtained
a protection order, has no right to administration
of pro-
perty acquired by her after the date of the order (†) .
The
statute of Hen.
8
provides , that administration
may be given to the widow of a deceased , or to the next-
of-kin , or to both , as by the
discretion
of the
ordinary
shall be thought good ; and , amongst the next of kin , the
ordinary shall be at liberty to choose those of the claimants
whom he pleases .
The practice now , is to give the admi-
nistration
to the widow , and , in default of a widow , to such
of the next of kin
as , under
the statutes which
regulate
the distribution
of the personal
estates
of intestates , are
entitled .
Though , if good
cause
be
shown , that
course
will be departed from (u) .
We may here, then , fitly introduce the inquiry , who are
the next of kin , and in what
order and manner
consan-
guinity is reckoned by our law.
Consanguinity
, or kindred , is defined by the writers
on
these subjects to be " vinculum personarum ab eodem stipite
descendentium
;" the connexion or relation of persons de-
scended from the same
stock
or common ancestor .
consanguinity
is either lineal , or collateral .
This
Lineal
consanguinity
is that which
subsists
between
persons , of whom
one is
descended
in a direct line from
the other , as between John
Stiles
(the propositus in the
table of consanguinity ) and his father , grandfather , great-
grandfather , and so upwards in the direct ascending line ;

CONSANGUINITY

or between John
Stiles
and
his
son, grandson , great-
grandson , and so downwards in the direct descending line .
Every generation , in this lineal direct consanguinity , con-
stitutes
a different
degree, reckoning
either
upwards
or
downwards : the father of John Stiles is related to him in
the first degree , and so likewise
is his son ; his grandsire
and
grandson
in the
second ;
his great -grandsire
and
great -grandson
in the third.
This is the only
natural
way of reckoning
the degrees
in the direct line, and there-
fore
universally
obtains ,
as
well in
the
civil (x) , and
canon (y) , as in the common law (≈).
of lineal
The doctrine of lineal consanguinity
is sufficiently plain Number
and obvious ; but it is at the first view astonishing
to ancestors.
consider the number of lineal ancestors which every man
has , within
no very great
number of degrees
;
and
so
many different bloods (a) is a man said to contain in his
viens , as he has lineal ancestors.
Of these he hath
two
in the first ascending
degree , his own parents ; he hath
four in the second, the
parents
of his father
and the
parents of his mother ;
and
so on.
This lineal
consan-
guinity, we may observe , falls strictly within the definition
of vinculum personarum
ab eodem stipite
descendentium ;
since lineal relations
are
such
as
descend
one
from the
other , and both of course
from the same common
an-
cestor.
consan-
Collateral
kindred
answers to the
same
description
: Collateral
collateral
relations
agreeing with the lineal in this , that guinity .
they descend from the same stock or ancestor ; but differ-
ing in this , that they do
not descend one from the other.
Collateral
kinsmen are such then
as lineally spring from
one and the same ancestor , who is the stirps , or root , the
stipes, trunk , or common
stock , from whence these rela-
tions are branched out.
As if John Stiles
has two sons ,
who have each a numerous
issue ;
both these
issues are
lineally descended
from John
Stiles
as their common an-

cestor ; and they
are collateral
kinsmen
to
each
other,
because
they are all descended
from this common ancestor
,
and all have a portion
of his blood in their veins , which
denominates them consanguineos
.
We must be careful
to remember , that the very being
of collateral
consanguinity
consists in this descent from
one and the same common ancestor.
Thus Titius and his
brother
are related : why ? because
both
are derived from
one father : Titius and his first cousin
are related : why ?
because
both descend
from the same grandfather
; and his
second cousin's
claim to consanguinity
is this , that they
both are derived from one and the same great-grandfather .
In short , as many ancestors as a man has , so many com-
mon stocks he has, from which collateral kinsmen
may be
derived .
The method of computing
these
degrees
by the civil law
(which was adopted in determining
the next of kin of a
deceased
person ) was to count upwards from either of the
persons related to the common stock , and then downwards
again , reckoning
a degree
for each person both in ascend-
ing and descending .
Thus , to give an illustrious instance
from
our English
annals , king
Henry VII. , who
slew
Richard III. in the
battle of Bosworth , was
related
to
that
prince in
the
ninth
degree.
Let the propositus ,
therefore , in the table of consanguinity
represent
king
Richard III . , and the class marked
(ix , 5 ) king Henry VII.
Now their common
stock
or ancestor was king
Edward
III. , the abarus in the same table .
From Richard III. to
his father , Richard , Duke of York , we have one degree ;
then to Richard , Earl of Cambridge , a second
; to Edmund ,
Duke
of York,
a third ;
and
to Edward III.
a fourth
degree .
Now the descending line from Edward III. gives
to John of Gaunt
the fifth degree ; to John ,
Earl
of
Somerset , the
sixth ; to John,
Duke
of Somerset , the
seventh ; to Margaret , Countess of Richmond , the eighth ;
and thus to Henry VII. the ninth degree .

STATUTES

that law the degree is determined
simply by the number
of steps from the common ancestor to the one of them
most remote from that
ancestor (b).
According
to this
mode of reckoning , Henry VII. would be said
to be re-
lated to Richard III . in the fifth degree .

Having
premised these observations as to consanguinity ,
we may now inquire how the law distributes
the personal
estates of intestates , subject , of course , to the paramount
duty of paying
their
debts
and funeral
expenses .
For-
merly , as we have seen , controversies between the eccle-
siastical administrators
and the relations
arose , and other
disputes were frequent .
But now these
controversies
are
quite at an end : for , by the statute 22 & 23 Car . 2 , c. 10 , Statutes 22
explained by 29 Car . 2 , c . 3 , it is enacted , that
the sur-
and 29Car.
plusage of intestates ' estates (except of femes -covert , which rect distri-
are left as at common law ( c) , shall , after the expiration
residueof
of one full year from the death of the intestate , be distri- personal
buted in the following
manner : One third shall go to the
widow of the intestate , and the residue , in equal propor-
tions , to his children , or, if dead , to their representatives ;
that is , their lineal descendants ; if there are no children
or legal representatives subsisting , then a moiety shall go
to the widow , and a moiety to the next of kindred in equal
degree and their representatives : if no widow , the whole
shall
go to the
children : if neither widow nor children ,
the whole
shall
be distributed
among the next of kin in
equal degree and their representatives : but no representa-
tions
are admitted , among
collaterals , farther
than the
children of the intestate's
brothers
and sisters (d ) .
The
next of kindred , here referred to , are to be investigated by
the rules of consanguinity , as reckoned
according
to the
computation
of the civil law.

children , the mother as well as the father
succeeds
to the
effects of their children who die intestate and without wife
or issue .
As to the mother , however , a later act ( 1 Jac . 2 ,
c. 17 , s. 7) introduced
a further modification , for by that act,
if the father be dead , and any of the children die intestate
without wife or children , in the lifetime of the mother , she
and each of the remaining
children , or their
representa-
tives , shall divide his effects in equal portions .
With this exception , as to the mother (which in effect
reduces her to the position of a sister of the deceased
(e) ),
and subject to the right of representation
above
noticed ,
all those who are of the nearest of kin and of equal degree ,
whether of the half blood or of the whole blood , and in-
cluding maternal
as well as paternal
relations , share the
property equally .
Thus, if the nearest of kin of the in-
testates are great uncles or aunts , first cousins , and great
nephews or nieces , these being all related to the intestate
in the fourth degree, will all be admitted
to an equal dis-
tributive
share of his estate .
We may remark , however,
that though a grandfather
or grandmother
are of equal de-
gree to a brother
or sister , yet the latter
alone
are
en-
titled (f) . This arises , it would seem , by the rule of repre-
sentation , for the brothers and sisters represent the father .
It is obvious to observe , how near a resemblance this
statute of distributions
bears to our ancient English law ,
de rationabili
parte bonorum
; spoken of at the beginning
of this chapter (g) ; and which sir Edward
Coke (h) him-
self, though
he doubted the generality of its restraint
on
the power of devising by will , held to be universally
bind-
ing (in point of conscience at least) upon the administrator
or executor , in the case of either a total or partial intes-
tacy .
It also bears
some resemblance to the
Roman
law
(e) If the father
and
mother
be
both
alive , of course the
mother
can
take
nothing ,
she having
no
property , although
she is as near of
kin as the father ; whether
this will
be the case when
the law shall be
so far altered as to give the mother
separate rights of property , remains
to be seen.

of succession ab intestato (i) ; which , and because
the act
was also penned by an eminent civilian (k) , has occasioned
a notion
that
the parliament
of England copied it from
the Roman
prætor : though , indeed , it is little more than
a restoration , with some refinements
and regulations , of
our old constitutional
law ; which
prevailed
as an esta-
blished right and custom from
the time of king Canute
downwards , many
centuries
before Justinian's
laws were
known or heard of in the western parts of Europe .
likewise , there is another
part of the statute of distribu-
tions , where directions
are given
that
no child of the
intestate (except his heir -at-law) on whom
he settled
in
his lifetime any
estate in lands ,
or
pecuniary
portion ,
equal to the distributive
shares of the other children , shall
have any part of the surplusage with their brothers and
sisters ; but , if the
estates
so given them , by way of ad-
vancement , are not quite equivalent
to the other shares ,
the children
so advanced shall now have so much as will
make
them
equal .
This just
and
equitable
provision
(which , however , only applies when there is no will , and
not where there is a failure of disposition
by the will (7) )
has been also said to be derived from the collatio bonorum
of the imperial
law (m ) : which it certainly resembles in
some points , though it differs widely in others.
Before quitting this
subject, we may notice , that the
doctrine
and limits
of representation

statute of distributions
(by which no representation among

seem to have been principally borrowed from the civil law :
whereby it will sometimes happen , that
personal
estates
are divided per capita , and sometimes per stirpes ; whereas
the common law knows
no other rule of succession but
that per stirpes
only .
They
are divided per capita , to
every man an equal share, when all the claimants
claim
in their own rights , as in equal degree
of kindred , and not
jure repraesentationis , in the right of another person .
As ,
if the next of kin be the intestate's
three brothers , A. , B. ,
and C.; here his effects
are divided into three equal por-
tions , and distributed per capita , one to each : but , if one
of these brothers , A. , had
been
dead , leaving
three chil-
dren , and another , B. , leaving
two ; then the distribution
must have been per stirpes ; viz . one third to A.'s three
children ,
another third to B.'s two
children
;
and the
remaining
third to C. , the surviving
brother : yet , if C.
had also been dead , without issue , then A.'s and B.'s five
children , being all in equal degree to the intestate , would
take in their own rights per capita ; viz . each of them one

We
return
now to the

In
has no kindred ,

wife
or

exe-
tive inte-
cutor and
administra-
tor.
The interest vested
in the
executor by the will of the The respec-
deceased , may be continued and kept alive by the will of rests of exe-
the same executor : so that the executor of A.'s sole
cutor , or of A.'s
sole surviving
executor , is to all intents
and purposes the executor
and representative of A. him-
self (r) ; but the
executor of A.'s administrator
, or the
administrator
of A.'s executor , is not the representative of
A. (s).
For the power of an executor is founded upon the
special confidence and actual appointment of the deceased
;
and such executor is therefore
allowed
to transmit
that
power to another , in whom he has equal confidence : but
the administrator
of A. is merely the officer of the court ,
prescribed to him by act of parliament , in whom
the de- .
ceased has reposed
no trust
at all : and therefore , on the
death of that officer , it results back to the court to
ap-
point another .
And , with regard
to the administrator
of
A.'s executor , he has clearly no privity or relation
to A.;
being only commissioned to administer
the
effects of the
intestate executor , and not of the original
testator .
There-
fore in both these cases , and whenever the course of repre-
sentation from executor to executor is interrupted by any
one administration
, it is necessary for the
court to com-
mit administration

this

representative of the deceased
in matters of personal pro-
perty (t).
But he may , as well as an original
adminis-
trator ,
have
only
a limited
or
special
administration
committed to his care , viz . of certain specific effects , such
as a term of years , and the like ; the rest being committed
to others (u).
Fifthly , of
the office
and duty of
executors
and admi-
nistrators.
Having thus shown what is , and who may be , an execu-
tor or administrator , we will proceed
, lastly , to
inquire
into some few of the principal
points
of their office
and
duty.
These in general are very much the same in both
executors
and administrators
;
excepting , first , that the
executor is bound
to perform
a will, which an adminis-
trator is not , unless where a testament is annexed to his
administration , and then he
differs
still less from
an
executor : and secondly , that
an executor
may do many
acts before he proves the will (x), but an administrator
may do nothing till letters of administration
are
issued ;
for the former
derives
his
power from
the will and not
from the probate (y) , the latter owes his entirely to the ap-
pointment
of the court.
If a stranger
takes upon him
to act as executor , without
any just authority (as by inter-
meddling with the goods of the deceased
(z ) , and many other
transactions ) (a) , he is called in law an executor of his own
Executor de Wrong , de son
tort, and is liable
to all the trouble of an
executorship , without
any of the profits
or advantages ;
but merely doing acts of necessity or humanity , as locking
up the goods , or burying
the corpse of the
deceased , will
not amount to such an intermeddling
as will charge a man
as executor of his own wrong (b) .
Such a one cannot bring
an action himself in right of the
deceased (c) , but actions

against
him.
And , in all
actions by
creditors
against
such an officious
intruder , he shall
be
named an executor , generally (d) ;
for the most obvious
conclusion which strangers can form from his conduct is,
that he has a will of the
deceased , wherein
he is named
executor , but has not yet
taken probate thereof (e) .
He
is chargeable with the debts of the

and on the amount
so estimated , to the accuracy of which,
according to the
best of his
belief , he must
pledge
his
oath , he must pay the duty imposed by law (m).
An ad-
ministrator
must
make a like
estimate (n ) for a similar
purpose .
These duties , and the
expenses
of the administration
,
including (if there be one ) the expenses of a suit , are the
next payments which
an executor
or administrator
may
make , and stand in preference to the debts.
Thirdly , the executor or administrator
is to make
an
inventory (o) of all the goods
and
chattels , whether in
possession or action , of the
deceased
; which he is bound
to deliver in to the public authorities
upon oath , if there-
unto lawfully required .
Fourthly , he is to collect all the goods and chattels so
inventoried ;
and to that end he has very large
powers
and interests conferred
on him by law ; being the repre-
sentative of the deceased (p ) , and having
the same pro-
perty in his goods as the principal
had when living , and
the same remedies to recover them .
And if there be two
or more executors , a sale or release
by one of them shall
be good against all the rest (q) ; but in case of adminis-
trators it is otherwise (r) .
Whatever
is so recovered , that
is of a saleable nature
and may be converted into
ready
money, is called
assets
in the hands of the executor
or
administrator ;
that
is
sufficient
or
enough
(from
the
French assez) to make him
chargeable to
a creditor
or
legatee, so far as such goods and chattels extend .
What-
ever
assets
so
come
to his hands he may
convert
into
ready money , to answer the demands that may be made
upon him
which
is the next thing to be considered ; for ,

ADMINISTRATION
OF THE
ESTATE .
655
debts of the deceased .
As regards the contract debts of
persons who shall die on or after the 1st January , 1870 ,
whether
they arise by specialty
or simple
contract , they
are, as we have seen , to be treated as of equal degree (8).
Therefore , the rules of payment by the executor or admi-
nistrator will
be
different
hereafter to
those which
now
obtain .
We will, therefore , shortly , first
state the order of pay-
ment which is at present to be observed , and then note
the change introduced for the future .
First , all
debts due to the
crown by record
or
spe-
cialty (t) are to be paid in priority to every other .
Secondly , those debts which
are by particular
statutes
to be preferred
to all others ;
such were formerly
the
forfeiture
for not
burying in woollen ,
now repealed by
54 Geo. 3 , c. 108 ; and such are those owing for letters
to the post-office (u) .
Thirdly , debts of record ,-judgments , decrees , statutes ,
and recognizances , if registered in accordance with 23 & 24
Vict. c. 38 , s. 3.
Fourthly , debts by specialty made upon good conside-
ration .
Fifthly, simple contract
debts
incurred upon good con-
sideration .
And, sixthly, bonds
or
covenants
voluntarily
given
without consideration : and , lastly , other voluntary
debts.
The effect of the new act
seems
to reduce those
here
(s) 32
&
33
Vict .
c.
46.
The
latter part of the act contains these
words : " All the creditors of such
persons , as well specialty
as simple
contract , shall be treated as standing
in equal degree and be paid accord-
ingly
out of the assets," whether
legal or equitable .
These
words
taken
alone
might
seem to
place
judgment debts upon the same foot-
ing as other debts , but the scope of
the act seems hardly
to warrant this
construction .

Retainer by
executor or
trator.
described as fourthly
and fifthly payable
(which constitute
the great bulk of debts ) to the same
degree .
Among debts of equal degree, the executor or adminis-
adminis-
trator is allowed
to pay himself first, by retaining
in his
hands so much as his debt amounts to (x).
But an execu-
tor of his own wrong
is not allowed
to retain : for that
would tend to
encourage creditors to strive who should
first take possession of the goods of the
deceased
; and
would
besides be taking advantage
of his own
wrong ,
which is contrary to the rule of law (y) .
Also , if no suit
is commenced against him , the executor may pay any one
creditor in equal
degree
his whole
debt, though
he has
nothing left for the rest : for , without
a suit commenced ,
the executor has no legal notice of the debt (2).
The new
act seems much to
enlarge the executor's power in this
respect.

Leonards'
Act.

the
debts
are
all
discharged , the
legacies
claim
the
next
regard :
which
are
to be paid by the
executor so far as his assets will extend ; but he may not
give
himself the
preference
herein ,
as in the
case
of
debts (a).
It
often
occurred
that
executors
or
administrators
,
after paying all the debts of which he had knowledge , had
some difficulty in dividing the surplus
among the bene-
ficiaries
under
the will, or the next -of-kin , from
fear of
being called upon
to pay other debts of which
they had
no knowledge .
In order to relieve them from this diffi-
culty , a recent act (b) , has declared that , if they give such
notices as are usually given in administration
suits , they
may safely divide the estate amongst those entitled
to it.
But the act reserves the claims of any outstanding
credi-
tor to follow the assets .
A legacy is a gift
or
bequest of property by will ; it
confers an inchoate right
to the legatee, which

perfect upon the executor assenting to the bequest, which ,
of course , until
he is satisfied
as
to the sufficiency
of
assets, he is not bound to do.
In case of a deficiency of
assets (c) to pay all the debts , no legatee
can receive
any-
thing .
In
case
there is, however , merely a deficiency of
assets to pay the legacies in full , then they take priority
between themselves in the following order : first, specific
legacies , that is to say, bequests of specific
parts of the
property ; and among
these
may be included
what
are
called demonstrative
legacies , that
is , legacies to be paid
out of a particular
specified fund (d) : secondly , general
pecuniary
legacies ,
or
gifts
of sums of money without
special mention of the fund
out of which
they are to be
paid .
As
between
legacies
constituting
these
classes
there
must
be , in
case
of insufficiency
of property ,
an
abatement
in proportion
to their value .
Legacies
are
considered as payable one
year after the testator's death ,
and if no deficiency of assets
exists , interest
is allowed
from that date.
If a legatee die before the testator , then the legacy is
lost or lapsed , except he was a child
or other issue of the
testator , and left issue , in which
case , as we have seen (e) ,
the legacy takes effect as if the legatee had died imme-
diately after the testator .

We
may
here
add, that it
is
the
business
of the Legacy
executor
or administrator
to pay the duty upon legacies
and
successions
to personalty , which
varies
according
to
the relationship
of the legatee or next -of-kin to the testa-
tor or intestate (ƒ).

TITLE
BY TESTAMENT
AND ADMINISTRATION.
Of donations
causamortis.
Besides , these formal
legacies , contained in a man's
will and testament , there is also permitted
another death-
bed disposition
of property ; which is called
a donation
causâ mortis.
And
that
is , when
a person in his
last
sickness , apprehending
his
dissolution
near , delivers
or
causes
to be delivered to another
the possession of any
personal goods , (under which
have
been
included
bonds ,
and bills drawn by the deceased
upon his banker ) , to keep
in case of his decease .
This gift , if the donor dies , needs
not the assent of his
executor : yet it shall not prevail
against
creditors ;
and is accompanied with this
implied
trust , that , if the donor
lives , the property
thereof
shall
revert to himself, being
only given
in
contemplation
of
death , or mortis causâ (g).
This method of donation might
have subsisted in a state of nature , being always accom-
panied with delivery of actual
possession ( ) ;
and so far
differs
from
a
testamentary
disposition
:
but
seems
to
have been handed to us from the civil lawyers ().
When all
expenses , debts ,
duties ,
and
legacies
have
been paid by an executor , and when all
expenses , debts ,
and duties , have been paid by an administrator
, the clear
surplus is to be divided among the residuary legatees , or ,
as the case may be, the persons entitled under the statute
of distribution
.
When this has been done , the duties of
the executor
or
administrator
are at an end.
Formerly
when
a testator
failed ,
either
partially
or
wholly ,
to
dispose of the residue of his personalty , the executor was
entitled to retain for his own benefit the
property so un-
disposed of ( ).
This privilege has been taken away by an
act of 1830
( 7) ; and now any such undisposed of residue
must be applied in accordance with the statutes of distri-
bution .
If, however , there is no person
entitled
under
the statute , the privilege
remains .

thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine between John
Brown
of Sutton in the

duly made and executed
his will dated the ninth day of March one
thousand
eight
hundred
and forty -nine whereby
he devised his
messuage
and farm
known
as Hazeldean
Farm and then

it includes not only lands and tenements , but whatsoever
may
be inherited ,
be it corporeal ,
or incorporeal , real ,
personal , or mixed .
Thus ,
an heir -loom ,
or
piece of
furniture , which by custom descends to the heir together
with a house , is neither
land , nor tenement , but a mere
moveable ; yet , being inheritable , is comprised
under
the
general word
hereditament :
and
so
a
condition , the
benefit
of which may descend
to a man from his ancestor ,
is also an hereditament (o).
Hereditaments
then , to use the largest
expression ,
are
of two kinds , corporeal and
incorporeal .
Corporeal
con-
sist of such as affect the senses
; such as may be seen and
handled
by the body.
Their
nature
sufficiently
appears
from what has
been
already said .
Incorporal
heredita-
ments
are not the objects
of sensation , they are creatures
of the mind existing only in contemplation
: and although
they
commonly
( p) lead
to the personal
enjoyment by
their owner of sensible results ,
these
are not the here-
ditaments themselves , but their profits .

By a condition
is here meant a qua-

annexed
to
a conveyance
of lands , whereby
it
is provided that in case a particular
event
does
or does not happen , or
a particular
act is done or omitted
to
be
done,
an estate shall
com-
mence ,
be
enlarged
or
defeated.
As an
instance
of the
condition
here intended ,
suppose A. to have
enfeoffed B. of
an acre of ground ,
upon condition
that , if he or his
heir should
pay the

he
or
his
heir
should
re-enter ;
this condition would be an heredi-

death
should

would

as

Instances
simi-
lar to this are of daily
occurrence
in
the
case
of

form
of
mortgages
provides
for a re-conveyance upon

an example
of an incorpo-

hereditament , which in itself
is unaccompanied

CHAPTER III.
Incorporeal
heredita-
ments de-
fined.
INCORPOREAL
HEREDITAMENTS
.
AN incorporeal hereditament may be described as a right
to the
enjoyment of certain profits or advantages , which
right is transmissible
to heirs according to the law regu-
lating the transmission of land .
Except in a few cases (a)
an incorporeal
hereditament
issues out of or is annexed
to
a corporeal
hereditament ,
and the profits
of it are
objects of our bodily
senses , but itself is an abstract idea .
A rent issues out of land , and the product
is money , but
the right which
produces that money is a thing invisible.
It is necessary, in order to form a clear notion of incor-
poreal
hereditament , to distinguish
the profits produced ,
the incorporeal
hereditament which
gives a right to enjoy
them , and the corporeal hereditament (if any) from which
they issue .
An annuity
charged on land , for instance , is
an
incorporeal
hereditament
:
for
though
the
money ,
which
is the fruit or product of this
annuity , is doubtless
of a corporeal nature , as is the land , yet the annuity itself,
which produces that money , is a thing invisible , has only
a mental
existence , and
cannot
be
delivered
over from
hand
to hand .
So tithes , which still more closely relate
to the land , being
(before the
commutation
acts ,) pay-
able in kind , as the tenth
sheaf or tenth lamb , were still
an incorporeal
hereditament , for they , being
merely

There are nine principal classes

ments-I. Commons ; II.
Easements ; III .
Rents ; IV.

one person
may possess
over the land of another ; it is an
incorporeal
hereditament
entitling its owner to enjoy cer-
tain
substantial
parts of the land
or the produce of the
land , such as to dig and carry away turf, to hunt , hawk (c) ,
catch fish , or cut wood.
It is , in mediæval law French,
described
as a profit à prendre , and must be distinguished
from an easement
which also gives certain rights
over the
land , but does not entitle its owner to take absolutely any
substantial
part of the land , though it may entitle him to
take and enjoy those natural
accessories
of land which
are
of a universal kind, such as light , or air , or a flow of water ,
and do not grow or spring out of the particular
piece of land
itself.
Thus
the right to have the light and air over the
land unobstructed
by buildings
on it, or the right to the
lateral
support
of land
or buildings
, are easements
: as
also the right
to draw water
out of a well for domestic
purposes
(d),
or to wash and water cattle at a pond (e).
An easement may involve a duty to be discharged on the

of
incorporeal
hereditaments
for-
merly classified
separately , is here
omitted
from the list of classes.
Tithes no longer exist in a distinct
species ; they have become members
of the class of rents .

part of the landowner
,
such
as
to
maintain
his
land
at
a
level sufficient
to
secure his neighbour's wall from falling
,
or
to
keep
a
fence
or
road
in
repair
(f
).
This
,
however
,
can never be the case with
a
common
or
profit
à
prendre
,
which only entitles the owner
to
take the particular
pro-
duce
if
it
be there
,
but
creates
no obligation
on the part
of
the landowner
to
provide
it
,
by keeping up the stock
of
fish
or
planting wood
.
The
distinction
between the two
classes
of right
is
,
as
we shall
see
,
important
on account
of
the law providing
different
rules
of
evidence for the
establishment
of
the claims
(g
).
Of common
there are
four
different
principal
sorts
:
common
of
pasture
,
of
piscary
,
of
turbary
,
and
of
estovers
.
Common
of
pasture
is
,
as
its
name imports
,
the right
of
pasturing
cattle upon the land
of
another
.
Common
of
turbary
is
the right
of
digging
turves
for
fuel
this right necessarily extends only
to
those parts
of
a
waste piece
of
ground where there
is
dry peat
or
heather
,
and not
to
grass turf
(h)
;
consequently
in
this case
a
com-
moner
could
not
interfere
with
the
lord
enclosing
at
pleasure any waste land suitable for
a
meadow
.
Common
of
piscary
is
a
liberty
of
fishing
in
the lord's
river
or
ponds
.
Common of estovers
or
estouviers
,
that
is
,
necessaries
,
(
from
estoffer
,
to
furnish
),
is
a
liberty
of
taking
neces-
sary wood
,
for the use
or
furniture
of
a
house
or
farm
,
from
off another's
estate
.
The
Saxon word
,
bote
(¿),
is
used
(f
)
Such
a
duty on the part
of
the
owner of the servient
land
is con-
trary to
the original
idea
of
an
easement

by us as synonymous
to the French estovers : and there-
fore house-bote is a sufficient allowance of wood , to repair ,
or to burn in, the house ; which latter is sometimes called
fire-bote ;
plough -bote
and
cart-bote
are
wood
to be
employed
in making
and
repairing
all
instruments
of
husbandry
and
hay-bote ,
or
hedge -bote, is wood for
repairing of hays , hedges , or fences (k) .
These botes or
estovers must be reasonable ones ; ordinarily
they may be
taken in such quantities
as any tenant or lessee may take
off the land let or demised to him, without waiting for any
leave, assignment , or appointment
of the lessor , unless he
be restrained by special covenant to the contrary .
But it
has been held that a common of estovers
, even for build-
ing new houses upon the land , was good (1).
There is also a common for digging
for
coals, minerals ,
stones , and other similar substances (m).
This last , how-
ever , is
rare , the minerals
under
all lands
in a manor
usually belonging
to the lord as part of the soil of which
the freehold is in him (n).
All
these
resemble in many
respects the common of pasture , but in one respect they
go much further : common of pasture being only a right
of feeding
on the herbage and vesture of the
soil , which
renews
annually ;
but
common of turbary ,
and
those
aftermentioned , are a right of carrying
away the very
itself.

The history of what are usually called common lands , or
commons , is to some extent identical with that of manors ,
and of the
tenure by which copyholds
are held ; of this

among their tenants , to be holden in socage
tenure (p) , in
order to
enable the
tenants
to maintain
beasts
for the
plough and to manure the land , the right to pasture upon
the great uninclosed wastes belonging
to the lords was by
universal
consent and
as a necessity of the case , for the
maintenance
and advantage of tillage , annexed to such
grants , and in a similar manner and for similar
reasons
the
other kinds of common also had their origin .
The
com-
mon
so
annexed
to the
holding
of particular
lands by
universal
consent
came to be recognised by the common
law, upon which therefore it now depends , and is called
common
appendant .
Common
of
pasture
appendant ,
therefore , was
annexed to arable land (9) , and now can
be claimed
only
in respect of arable
land , from
which
alone the necessity for it arose (r) ,
and in those places
where the number
has not been fixed by usage ( s) it can
only be
claimed
for so many
cattle
as are necessary to
plough
or manure
the tenant's
arable land , or so many
commonable cattle (i. e. horses , kine , and sheep ,) (t) as are
levant and couchant
upon the land of the
commoner , that
is , so many as the produce of the land
in
summer
and
autumn
can maintain
during the winter (u) .
This
right
of common may be limited
in various ways
as to the time
of exercising it (e ).
In like manner
common of turbary

respect
of a house , for

And the
right is limited
as to quantity by the requirements
of the
house (y) : the
same
remark
applies
to
common
of
estovers
under which the wood must be used in the house
or on the land .
The rights of the commoners were limited ,
as we have
said , but in process
of time
these claims
of the tenants
became
somewhat oppressive upon
the lords , who found
considerable
difficulty ,
through
the
interference
of the
commoners , in taking the profit of the wastes, woods , and
pastures .
In order to remedy this , the statute of Merton
(20 Hen. 3 ,
c. 4 , ) was passed, which , in substance , pro-
vided , that
so long as common
land was left unenclosed
sufficient
for
the tenements of the commoners , with free
egress and regress
from their tenements to the pasture , the
lords might enclose
as much as they pleased of the residue .
This act has been
confirmed
and
extended
by subsequent
statutes (z) .
It , however , was simply
declaratory of the
common law (a).
But the benefit of it was so far felt and
admitted
that the court of chancery has given its pow-
erful
assistance
to
lords
in approving , by
restraining
commoners from pulling down enclosures until the suffi-
ciency of the remaining
common
land
had
been deter-
mined , and in other ways (b) .
The right given
by these
statutes has been
so extensively
used that it is believed no

The onus of proving that these

of the soil of a common , though he be not the lord of the
manor (e).
Besides the
common
called
appendant , which
had its
origin in the way we have mentioned , there
are
other
ways in which common has arisen .
Common appurtenant
is common which has been, or by law is presumed to have
been , created by grant : consequently it may
be
annexed
to
any
lands
though
not
arable
and
not
even in the
manor (f) , and
may extend in the
case
of
common of
pasture to other beasts than those generally
commonable ,
to hogs , goats , or other animals , or geese (g).
This, then ,
does
not
depend upon
any general right
by common law, for it rather is against
common right ;
it is claimed by immemorial
usage and prescription ( ) ,
in the
absence
of a modern grant by which it may be
created.
Common
appurtenant
must
be limited in
extent in
some way similar to that by which common
appendant is
limited.
Thus
pasture
must
be stinted
or
limited by
levancy
and
couchaney , which is generally
the
case , or
some other way (i) .

and the like must
be limited , usually
by the domestic
requirements of the
commoner ; though ,
as
before men-
tioned
in the
case
of
estovers ,
a prescription
for such
commoner is not necessarily bad , because
it is for a larger
quantity
than
at first
sight
appears reasonable , for
such
might
be
granted
at this day .
As
a
consequence
of
this
limitation the lords
claimed the right of approving
common appurtenant , to support which claim
the statute
of Merton
was expressly extended to common appurtenant
by a later act (j).
In those cases where common is appurtenant to a house,
if the
house be pulled
down and another
rebuilt
in
its
stead , the prescription will not be thereby lost (k) , and of
course , therefore , alterations
in a house do not destroy the
right so long , nevertheless , that the
new
buildings
or
alterations are not such as to require larger profits ; but if
that
be the
case ,
as , for instance , if new chimneys
be
added to a house , the common will remain
restricted by
the former
requirements , no turves
or
estovers
could be
used in the
new
chimneys ( ) .
Upon
similar
grounds
common
appendant
or
appurtenant
to a house or land
cannot be severed
(m) , unless
the amount
be limited
by
numerical quantity , in which
case no injury could arise to
the landowner by the common being severed (n ).

Lastly , there is what
is called
common in gross , or at
large ,
which is neither
appendant
nor
appurtenant
to
land , but is simply
a right belonging
to a person under
a
grant to a man and his heirs : it may be claimed by pre-
scription
where the nature of the
case admits
of such a
thing, as where the claim
is by a parson of a church
or
other corporation (o) .
It is a separate inheritance , and
may be vested in one who does not possess
any land what-
ever
it may be for any certain
and definite number of
cattle ; but it cannot be for an unlimited
number , for a
claim to such a right must be , if it exist at all , a claim to
the exclusive pasturage , which is not a common (p) , but a
separate ownership
in part of the land just
as much
as
the
ownership
of the
minerals
under
the
surface (q).
Common
in gross
does
not appear ever to have existed
except for pasture , though there is no legal reason against
its existence in the other cases
(r) .
We have hitherto explained the different modes in which
commons
have
arisen ,
so far
as
they
include
all
the
different
species of common ; but common of pasture may
exist in another form, which
springs
from
its
nature
.
This
is
called
common by reason of vicinage
or
neigh-

where the
inhabitants
of two townships
which lie
contiguous
to
one another
have been accustomed
to
intercommon
one with another

The inhabitant
of one township
has no right to put his
beast into the other's common ; but the custom is that if
the beast
stray there, it is no trespass (u).
It follows
that one township

that the two have

The nature of a common , from
what has

such that the lord has the sole interest in the soil , and so
long as he does not interfere
with the right of the com-

We have explained all the different
kinds of common
as distinguished
by the modes in which they
may have
arisen , and the nature of the title under which they
are
held .
We shall again , in explaining
at length
the titles
by which
real property is held or enjoyed, have to revert
to the subject of commons
and other analogous heredita-
ments .
We
may
here
mention
some
long -established
usages which
obtain in particular
localities , and which ,
to some
extent , resemble
common , though
different
in
their nature .
These are what are called
" cattlegate " in
the north and " beastgate " in the south , and " shack ” in
Norfolk ,
Lincolnshire
,
and Yorkshire .
These
seem
all
to have similar
origin , where several owners
of small
ad-
joining parcels of ground , in order to save the expense of
fences
and for more
beneficial
enjoyment , have
allowed
their
cattle to wander promiscuously
over the whole , the
number of cattle being , of course ,
limited
proportionally
to the several parcels of land . " Shack " is upon -arable
land
after
harvest
until the land is sowed
again .
In
some cases where the original
boundaries
have been
lost,
the result is that the ownership of the land is the right to
turn so many beasts
upon it, but it is essentially different

from common rights in that the soil itself belongs to the
proprietors .
It is said that
" where one who has pur-
chased divers
parcels together in which the
inhabitants.
have used to have
shack ,' and long since has inclosed it,
and notwithstanding
always
after harvest the inhabitants
have had shack there by passing
into it by bars or gates
with their
cattle ,
there it
shall
be taken
as
common
appendant
or appurtenant , and the owner cannot exclude
them of common there notwithstanding
that he will not
common with them , but hold his own
so inclosed in seve-
ralty ; and that is proved
by the
usage,
for , notwith-
standing
the
ancient
inclosure ,
the
inhabitants
have
always had shack there " (f).
In the absence
of such an
usage an owner of " shack
may inclose , if he please ,
and hold in severalty
absolutely without regard to other
owners
and even when the right of shack continues the
land becomes his in severalty , and subject only to that right .
In the other cases of the " cattlegate " and " beastgate ,"
the original boundaries
seem to have been lost , and the
owners jointly possess
the land in undivided
shares
with
several
inheritance (g).
It is
conceived
that
each
of
them
may
obtain
by partition
his
share of the land
in
severalty ,
which , if there
existed
minerals
under
the
land , might be of the utmost importance
; and from this
the distinction
between
these
customs
and
commons
is
apparent .

these powers did not extend to diminish
or interfere with
the rights of the commoners , which could only be done by
the
consent of all, a thing never in practice capable of
being
obtained where the numbers

In order ,
however , to render the large tracts of common land more
beneficial
to society by cultivation
,
acts of parliament
have been from time to time passed
authorizing
inclosure
of particular
commons , and the allotment of specific parts
in severalty to the commoners in lieu of their
rights
of
common .
This has been reduced to a systematic process .
A general act has been
passed
under which inclosure com-
missioners for England and Wales have been established ,
before whom
proposals
for
inclosures
are
laid , and who
arrange and sanction the details of each , and the allot-

of their respective interests .
The
commissioners
make
an annual
report to parliament
of the commons which
have been dealt with by them during

to such support by adjacent buildings , the
right to have party walls

the right to commit

An ease-
ment is created by an implied
grant in
cases where the
two tenements being held
by one owner are dealt with by
him so as to sever in part
the inheritance , and when the
intention of the parties
would
be frustrated
unless the
easement were granted .
Thus , if a man sells and conveys
a piece of land
surrounded
by other land
belonging
to
himself, by implication
he grants also a right of way over
his own land to that sold (t) .
The law implies
that by
such a grant to
a purchaser
conceditur et id sine quâ res
ipsa haberi
non potest , so when
mines
or trees are sold ,
the power of entry to dig shafts or carry away the timber
is by implication
granted (u).
For
a similar reason an
easement may by implication
be
reserved
to
a vendor
or grantor of the
servient
tenement .
Thus , if a man
excepts
out of a grant
all mines
and minerals (x) , he
excepts
also the right of going upon the land and making
cannot strictly be reserved .

But there is considerable
difference between the case of implied
grant
and that of
implied
reservation .
In the former case the law will con-
strue
the implied
grant in a
liberal
manner ,
so
as to
include all those continuous and apparent easements
which
have in fact
existed
and
been
enjoyed by the previous
owner for the benefit of the tenement granted , and which
though
not absolutely necessary to the enjoyment
of it ,
are yet necessary for the complete and comfortable enjoy-
ment in the
manner
in which it has
been
previously
used (y) : but an implied
reservation will only extend to
cases of absolute
necessity , because
the principle
that
a
man
may not derogate from his own
grant
must
not
be infringed
except in
cases
of absolute
necessity (~) ;
and if the grant be made for
a particular
purpose , the
grantor
is bound
not
to
do
anything
that will
prevent
the land from being used for that purpose (a) .
A distinction
is
also taken
between those
easements
which are apparent
and continuous
and those which
are
discontinuous ,
the
construction
of a grant
being more
readily extended ,
so
as to create by implication
of grant
or reservation the former than the latter .

the former kind , we may mention right to light and air ,

the

enjoyment , and is entitled to
have the full benefit of it in the state in which it exists

it flows (f).
He may apply it to any purpose he pleases

The right , how-

An owner of
land in which there is a well supplied by a subterranean
flow of water , cannot complain of his well being drained
through the operations of a neighbouring
mine owner (h) .

may be subdivided
into
two sorts : the right to receive
and the right to discharge
the water .
The latter
is the
one
more
easily
acquired
otherwise
than
by
contract ,
because , if a man make an artificial
watercourse upon his
own lands , presumably
it is for his
own benefit and not
that of his neighbour , and
he
cannot
be compelled
to
continue it after it ceases to be beneficial to him ( ) .
On
the other hand , if he make a watercourse for his own pur-
poses which runs into his neighbour's land , he is obviously
doing
that which
is an infringement
of his neighbour's
property : this infringement
may by prescription

( 1) , though , of
course,
until
then
his
neighbour
may

any
time

so put an end to
the in-
fringement .
It
seems
that by allowing
without
active interference
contamination
or diminution
of quantity
on the part of
those from whose lands the water runs , to continue for a
period

to create an easement by prescription ,
the right to the flow of water in its natural

cise such rights
as arise ex rei naturâ in order to preserve
them (n) .
It need hardly
be mentioned
that where there
is a natural
stream of water , the owner of land through
which it
passes
has
a right
to
insist upon its
being
allowed to flow from
his
land
to that of the next
pro-
prietor below him.
The right to light and air is the right to enjoy the free
passage laterally of light and air from a neighbour's
land .
It is obvious that
the light which
falls vertically
from
the sky cannot
form
the
subject of an
easement
, as it
necessarily must be enjoyed by the owner of the land , upon
the maxim cujus est solum , ejus est usque ad cœlum et inferos .
This easement is
one which
at first sight
may seem to
have a similar character in regard to its having
a natural
origin ,
as the
right of water ;
it
is , however , not
so ,
because the first right which the ownership of land seems
to give is that of doing what the owner pleases thereon ,
either by building
or otherwise
; and therefore
he has ,
by virtue of such primary right , the power of obstructing
the free passage of light and air from
over his
own land
to
that of his neighbour ; if, then ,
his
neighbour
is in
any way
entitled
to have such passage of light and air
free from obstruction , it is no inconsiderable
interference
with
or
abridgment
of the
dominion
which
a
man
usually
possesses
over his land .
Inasmuch , however , as it
would
be productive of injurious
results in many
cases ,
where men have built houses or other buildings upon or
near to the extremities
of their lands ,
having
windows
opening
towards the neighbouring
land , if it were lawful
for their neighbours
to obstruct
the light
and air coming
to those windows , the law recognises the right to prevent
such obstruction
when duly
acquired
as
a proper
ease-
against
other
proprietors
below
him to use the water to their pre-
judice, such acquired right gives no
right as against proprietors
above ;

ment.
Such an easement may of course , though it rarely
happens , be acquired by express
grant, and in that
case
may be unlimited .
But where , as is generally the case , the
right is acquired
by prescription
( o) , i.e. , by user , which
user must be by a building (p) , it follows that the extent
of light and air must depend upon the amount
which has
been
enjoyed
during
the
period
which
has gained the
prescriptive
right (q) ,
and
is
limited
to that which is
necessary
for
the
ordinary
occupation
and
use of the
building in respect of which the claim is made (r) , regard
being
had to the general character and situation of such
building.
The law , of course , permits
a man
at any time
before
the prescribed
period has expired
to do any act, such as
building or
placing
any
other
obstruction
on his own
land to prevent
the user of light and air, and thereby to
prevent the
acquisition
of an
easement (s).
It may be
here remarked
that the law does
not recognise the enjoy-
ment
of a prospect
as
a right
which
can be
acquired
otherwise
than
by grant or covenant (t) , and it is very
doubtful whether it can even be so acquired
as an ease-
ment , whether
any grant or covenant could do more than
create
a personal
obligation
between
the
parties
not
attaching
as an easement either to the house where the
prospect is enjoyed , or the land over which the prospect

Act (u).
The right to light and air being the
easement which
most frequently
leads to litigation , this may be a suitable
place to notice
briefly
the remedies which
the law pro-
vides for the infringement
of such rights .
The
redress
which
common
law provides is that of damages,
or
a
payment of such
an amount of money
as shall in the
opinion
of a jury be a reasonable equivalent of the injury
done.
In estimating
these damages, it would

account "the

calculating
such
da-

and the future
possible uses to which the building might
be put if the light
and air had not been
affected , ought
to be disregarded (y) .

the courts of law afford , the court of chancery affords a

be an easement by

the

tenement is
bound
to
keep in repair
a fence or party

The
easement which
remains
to be considered is that
nuisances
by which
a nuisance
may
be legalised .
Thus if a man
carry on a trade which
causes
offensive
noises ,
smells ,
smoke , or other similar
annoyances to his neighbours , he
may , where such an
easement has been duly acquired , be
free from liability for the consequences
; but the conditions
under
which
easements
are acquired
must
be
strictly
complied with (ƒ) ; and ,
moreover
, the trade must
be a
lawful one, and calculated to be for the public benefit , and
must be carried on in a proper and reasonable manner (g),
and in a proper place (h).
The existence of nuisances in
the
neighbourhood
which have
been legalised
by pre-
scription , does
not justify an additional
nuisance even of
the same kind (i) .
But a slight change in the
character
of a nuisance arising
from improvements of mode of ma-
nufacture and in the ordinary course of business , but not
increasing
the nuisance , will
not
cause
the right to be
lost (k).

general right of an owner of property
to enjoy that pro-
perty without interference
by others.
Thus the support
of the surface of land by subjacent
minerals
belonging to
a different
owner is not to be considered
as an
easement
of the surface ;
yet if the
mineowner
should
work
his
mines so that the surface should sink , there would arise a
cause
of action
or suit
in respect of the
subsidence (1),
and this notwithstanding
that the mines were worked skil-
fully (m ). If a house falls in consequence
of the improper
and irregular pulling down of a neighbouring
house , there
would
be a cause of action ( n ) , although in the absence of
express

on
the
part of the

other rights , and
so end them .
On these modes of ex-
tinguishment
no comment is required .
But , inasmuch
as most easements
are
an infringement
of the first principles
of property
as
regards
the
ser-
vient tenements , the law is not slow to re -establish that
right of property
in
its
integrity
,
and therefore
deduces
from
indirect
circumstances
the
determination
of the
infringement
.
If
,
therefore
,
the
owner
of
the dominant
tenement ceases
to
take advantage
of
his rights
,
and the
intention
to
abandon them
can
be
inferred
,
the
law de-
clares that they cannot afterwards
be
resumed
(p
).
So
,
also
,
if
the owner
of
the dominant tenement makes
alterations
therein
,
so
that
the easement cannot
be en-
joyed
in
the same
way
as
previously
,
but
necessarily
imposes
a
greater burden upon the servient tenement
,
the
easement will be lost
(q);
or
if
he allows
an act
to
be
done
adverse
to
the
easement
,
thereby
indicating
an
abandonment
of
his right
,
it
will
be
at
an end
(r).
From similar
principles
it
follows
that where
an
ease-
ment
of
an artificial
character
is
imposed upon the ser-
vient
tenement
for the
convenience
of the
dominant
tenement
,
the possession
of
both

puts an
end
to
the easement

things may create by way of contract a valid burden upon

so
that he
may
be
liable
to pay the
annuity as a debt , yet it in no way affects the property
so
as to continue a burden upon it in the hands of an alienee
without notice of the contract
: it is no legal rent in con-

the

The exceptions referred to are as follows
: a rent may
be reserved out of a reversion or remainder
to which

incident (h) ;
this ,

incorporeal , will become
corporeal , and then the remedy of distress will apply , so as
to recover all arrears.
A rent also may be reserved out of
the herbage of land , because
the cattle upon the land may
be distrained ( ) .
Again , tithes may be granted subject to
a rent ; this arises
from

enactment (k).

rent
is
a
rent -service .
It
is
closely
connected with
the
feudal
system of tenure , which
we shall
hereafter
discuss .
Rent-service therefore
includes , in addition
to
the
usual
rent of the
nature
of tribute , some corporal
service, now to a great
extent
fallen
into disuse .
But
there
are
a few cases
where
this
corporal
service
has
remained as the most substantial part of the rent .
Thus ,
some lands are held by the service of keeping up a grind-
stone for the
convenience
of a
manor ,
and
paying
a
peppercorn rent
(n), or cleansing
the parish
church (0),
or ringing the church bells at stated
hours (p) .
The most
remarkable
characteristic
which the common law attached
to rent - service
was, that
in case it should be in arrear
on
the day it ought
to be paid , the lord
or reversioner
had
the right of distraining
, even
though
no contract
to that
effect
existed
between
the
parties .
Of this
power of
distress we shall say more hereafter .
It
follows
from
what
has just
been
said , that the
reservation of rent -service must be made, if to any person
by name or description , to the owner of the reversion ; if
it be attempted
to be made to a stranger , the liability to
pay on the part of the grantee would , if existent
at all ,
rest on contract only , unless the execution of the grantee
of the
deed of
grant
can
be
construed
as creating
a
charge upon the land by him (7) , and then a rent -charge
and not rent- service will
be created .
If the reservation
be of a rent simpliciter
without
saying
to whom , it is
a good reservation (r) .
By the common law a lease might be granted and rent-
service
reserved
by parol , without
any
written
docu-
ment (s).

to lead to many disputes

of the tenancy , the Statute of Frauds Leases, how
was passed (t) , which enacted that
all
leases
and other
interests there specified , not put in writing and signed by
the
parties

or their

lawfully
authorised in writing , should
have the effect of leases
at
will only , but it excepted
leases
for terms
not
exceeding
three years from the making thereof , and upon which the
rent
reserved amounted
to two-thirds at least of the full
value of the
land .
Under this act there still continued
much
litigation ,
principally in
determining
whether
a
given
instrument
operated as a present demise or merely
as an agreement for a lease (u) .
With the view of putting
an end to this , an act (x) has been recently
passed, by
which all leases which
are required by law to be in writing
are
rendered
void
at law
unless
made by deed .

acts then is that now
all instruments ,
whether
they

be held to
operate

demises
or not , create no tenancy at law, and therefore
give rise to none of the legal
incidents of tenancy unless
they fall

But an instrument
thus
void as a lease will now , it
seems , be construed
as
an

as such in a court of

taken
and made under
a lease invalid by the statute , a
court of law will still admit the document for the purpose
of showing
the
conditions
of the tenancy
from
year to
year , which the law would
imply as
existing (a).
The
statute does not therefore take
away all rights
under the
instruments
against
which it was
directed , but rather
tends to settle the mode in which such rights
should
be
enforced .
We may here notice that the interest of the grantee of
lands under a grant by which rent -service is reserved
must
be less than a fee simple .
The statute commonly called
Quia Emptores
( 18 Ed .
1)
enacted
in substance that
no
tenure should thenceforward be created upon an alienation
in fee (b) , and consequently in order that there can be any
tenure , the
estate
granted
must
be such as to leave a
reversionary
interest in the
grantor ;
and it
is to this
reversion
that
in law rent - service
is
considered
as in-
cident (c) , and
therefore the rent must be reserved to the
grantor , i. e. the reversioner (d).
A rent-charge is a rent unaccompanied by any corporal
service or
personal
relation
between the
tenant
of the
land and the owner of the charge , who
need
not be and
usually is not the owner of any reversionary interest in
the land expectant upon the determination
of the tenant's
interest .
The power of distress is however incident
to it,

but is made so by contract .
Thus , if a man grant
land
absolutely,
subject
only to
a perpetual
rent , and in the
deed of grant there
is
a covenant or clause giving the
owner of the rent power of distress
in
case
of the rent

then this is a valid
rent -charge (e) ; or
if an owner
of
land
grant
a rent
to
issue out
of it,
whether for years or for any more lasting
interest , and
superadd to the grant a clause of distress , this would
be
to create a rent - charge .

rent , is a rent , not Rent-seck.
like rent - service made incident

payable like rent -charge by con-
tract ,
and is
distinguished
from
rent -charge
by the
absence
from
the
contract
of
any
clause
of distress .
Consequently ,
unless
the old writ
of assize
could
be
brought
which
required
seisin
to
be
acquired
by the
receipt of some portion
of the rent , there was formerly
no
remedy for recovering
the rent except by action for
damage
upon the contract .
A statute , however , has been
passed (f) giving to rent -seck the
same
remedy by dis-
tress
as exists in the
case of rents
reserved upon
lease ,
i. e. rent -services .
Rent-service and rent -seck can only
be created
inter
vivos
and by deed .
A rent -charge may
be created by will or deed .
There are a few varieties of the above classes of rents ,
to which particular
names have been given .
Thus , certain
established rents of freeholders and ancient copyholders of
a manor , which
cannot
be varied

called
rents of assize (g) .

by
reference to the civil
year , although
the intervals between them need not be in
every case years , they may either be greater
or
less
than
a year (k).
It is chargeable only upon the person of the
grantor , unlike a rent -charge, which
always
issues out of
specific land.
It is of course
incorporeal
in its nature ,

sense , be described as an heredita-

We have seen that rent is
something
given in return
for the use and enjoyment of the land demised : the tenant
is presumably
enabled
to pay it by means of the profits
of the land , when it consists of money
or
provisions
;
when it consists of personal
services , he is presumably
supported by the
profits of the
land , so as to be capable
of rendering
the
services.
The
law in
ancient
times.
founded
upon
this theory the rule that rent did not , like
interest
upon a debt , accrue de die in diem , but that even
when it consisted of money or provisions , it was a single
entire thing
payable
on the day
fixed (8) .
When
the
rent
consisted
of personal
services,
a similar rule
was
adopted that the
lord had
no claim in respect of them
till the
appointed
day.
In the latter
case
the
rule is
fair, and is not calculated
to work injustice , but in the
case
of the
rent
consisting
of money , many
difficulties
leading
to much
injustice
arose from this rule.
By the
occurrence of various events it obviously may often happen
that several persons may reasonably claim to be entitled
to
share the rent .
Thus , if a tenant

life of lands.
subject
to a lease
for years , died between two rent days
it would
be clearly fair that his executors should receive
a proportion
of the rent, yet by the common law, even if
he died on the morning of rent day , they were entitled
to
nothing, but the remainderman , by virtue of his
interest
when the rent actually became due, received the whole (t).
The same result
arose
whether
the lease was granted by
the
tenant in fee or by a tenant
for life with a power of
leasing .
Where a lease was granted by a tenant for life ,
without
a power of leasing , so that the interest
under the
lease expired at the death of the lessor , and the lessor died
between two rent days, then the lessee
paid nothing in

With the view of

Eq.
266,
where
the
question
is
discussed
whether , on a change of investment
of a trust fund when
stock
is sold
out, a tenant for life is
entitled
to
a share of the purchase money pro-
portioned
to the
time
which
has
elapsed since the preceding dividend
was paid .
The result
of these is
that
such
apportionment
will
only
be
made
in
very
special
circum-
stances .
(n) The act has been held not to
apply
so
as
to
apportion
rents
between the real
and
personal
re-
presentatives
of a tenant
in
fee.

between

representa-
tives
of a tenant
in tail , and the

or benefice from which the same shall be derived , " or on
the determination
by any other means whatsoever of the
interest of such person , " he or she or his or her executors
shall be
entitled
to a part of the rent or other periodical
payment ,
proportionate
to the
time which
shall
have
elapsed between
the last payment
and the
day of the
death or other
determination
(p).
The section then pro-
vides the mode in which
such
proportionate
part is to
be recovered.
The provisions of the act have been extended by statute
to rent -charge payable in lieu of tithes
under the Tithes
Commutation
Act (2) .
It will be
observed
that
appor-
tionment
under
the
act 4 Will . 4 , c. 22 ,
as to some of
the cases falling under section 2 , applies only to periodical
payments which have been settled by deed
or will since
the passing of that act.
The previous law, therefore , still
often
applies
where the
instrument
of settlement
took
effect before that date (r).
The operation of the
statute
may (s) be excluded by express (t) stipulation .
v. Danby ,
23 L. J.
Ch.
979, to
apply to an annuity which termi-
nates
on the death
of the annui-
tant.
The phraseology
of the act
is
obscure
on
the point
whether
the
periodical
payment
ceases
with the death , but
that
case is ,
as the Vice-Chancellor
remarks , so
clearly within the mischief
contem-
plated by the act, that
such
a con-
struction
is the
natural
one.
See,
however , R. v. Lords
of the Trea-
sury, 16 Q. B. 357.
(p) The determination
by " other
means " does not extend to the case
of eviction of a tenant by the land-
lord in the interval between
two
quarter
days , see Slack v. Sharpe ,
8 A.
& E.
366 ; Oldershaw v. Holt,
12 A. & E. 590.
Whether it would
do
so on the eviction
by
a para-
mount
title, see 1 Roll . Abr . 235 ;
Stevenson v. Lambard, 2 East , 575.
If
a tenant
be
evicted
from
part
of the
premises
by his landlord ,
a
suspension of the whole rent during
the
continuance
of the
eviction
will take place ; Morison

wick, 7 C. B. 266 ; Newton v. Allin,
