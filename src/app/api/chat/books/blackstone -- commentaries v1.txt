PREFACE .
THESE Commentaries upon the Laws of England pursue
the order adopted, and contain
much of the matter to be
found
in
Sir
W.
Blackstone's
celebrated
volumes (a).
They are meant to be such as he would
himself, if now
living ,
have
reproduced ,
amending
where
amendments
were needed , adding from
the reports
and statute book ,
and modifying
his style in accordance
with modern usage .
This task, even to the great
commentator , would
have
been
difficult , and to those on whom it has
fallen
has
necessarily been very formidable .
Neither is the existing
state of our law such as may facilitate
the
endeavour to
exhibit it in a shape
compendious and philosophical
.
In
part
dependent
upon
cases
decided with
reference
to
isolated
facts , in part dependent upon statutes , too often
enacted with reference to especial exigencies , each page of
our legal
volume
unfolded
by the hand of time adds to
the perplexities
of an author .
And difficult
as it may be
to determine the state of our law at this or at that period ,
it is scarce possible accurately to exhibit it at the moment
when a work , in the preparation of which years have been
continuously
occupied , emerges
from the press .
Admit-

many
valuable
notes , was
placed at the entire disposal
of the writers

ting that the
customary law of England is in the main
certain ; that though in some sort flexible , this flexibility
is made conducive to the ends of justice ; the statute law
is undeniably
shifting
and unsettled , for that
which
is
written to-day may be effaced
to-morrow , or may be im-
pliedly repealed
, or altered and amended by phraseology so
doubtful
as to call
for authoritative
exposition .
Thus is
it, that the judgment
of an appellate
court may falsify a
proposition
correct when it was penned ; that
a statute
consisting
of some
few brief
clauses
may
shatter
a
fabric
reared with persistent labour
by the commentator .
But
these considerations
should
neither
discourage
the
author nor
deter the reader.
The mishap adverted to is
inseparable
from
our
system of jurisprudence .
And to
abstain from the study of our law because it cannot in all
respects be precisely and accurately
set forth would be as
senseless
as to abstain from the study of pharmacy be-
cause its appliances cannot always cure.
These Commentaries
treat of The Rights of Persons ,
The
Rights
of
Things ,
Private
Wrongs ,
and
Public
Wrongs (b).
Under the first of
these
heads are consi-
dered not merely the absolute rights of individuals
, such
as the right of liberty and that of property , but also the
nature of those institutions , which , by the framers of our
law, were deemed
essential for assuring
and maintaining
them
the attributes of parliament , of the sovereign , and
of minor
magistrates
are here passed
under review-the
(b) The organic
arrangement
of Blackstone
has thus
been adhered to,
and the sequence of chapters in some
of these volumes is the same, or
nearly so, as in his own .

PREFACE .
states and conditions of the people are regarded-rights
and liabilities
incident
to the ordinary relations of society
are enumerated .
Under the second of the
above
heads
are included
the classification
and legal
nature
of real
property , the tenures
and
titles of its
occupants- the
various
species
of
estates-the modes of acquiring
and
transferring
them .
Personalty is likewise
here
noticed ,
the property in and title to it.
The third
division
of
this work is devoted to the redress of private wrongs-
the
courts
which
administer
it-their jurisdiction
and
method of procedure ; whilst the fourth
division
exclu-
sively concerns itself with acts which are criminal
in kind,
with
offences
against
the crown , the commonwealth , the
community -the manner of repressing
and of punishing
them .
An epitome follows of the Rise and Progress
of
the Laws of England.
Excessive
care
has been
taken in the
compilation
of
these Commentaries , and though
a reader may little heed
the precise apportionment of such labour as between those
who have bestowed it, somewhat should
perhaps be said
upon the subject .
For those
portions
of the work which
are irrespective of the Law of Real Property
and Equity ,
responsibility
attaches to him whose name first
appears
below ;
he has , however ,
been
most materially
aided in
preparing
them
by
several
learned
and
accomplished
friends ;-as regards some important
chapters ( c) in Vo-
lume

Mr.
GEARY of the Midland
Circuit ;

as
regards the account of the jurisdiction and

of

Court ,
the
Court
of Admiralty, and
the
Ecclesiastial
Courts ,
contained in the same volume

on
our
Law of Real
Property (f), on the Redress of Private
Wrongs by the

In dealing
with the
above
subjects
historic
changes
have not been disregarded , but the especial aim has been
to pourtray the living law.

aid
in
spreading
abroad
a

such
as
would
know them-in
teaching to all the
necessity of obeying them !

SECTION III .
THE LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
THE
municipal
law of England ,
or the
rule
of civil
conduct
prescribed
to the inhabitants
of this
kingdom ,
be divided
into
two
kinds
: I. The lex non scripta ,
the unwritten
or common law (a) ; and II. The lex scripta ,
the written
or statute law .
may
I.
The lex
non
scripta , or
unwritten
law,
includes
:
1.
General customs ; 2. Particular or local customs , i.e. ,
customs prevailing
in certain parts of the kingdom
; and
3.
Such portions of the lex mercatoria or law merchant as
are not prescribed and regulated by statute .
In this part of the section the above-mentioned
sub-
divisions of our unwritten
law will be considered , and it
will also be convenient
to speak of some
particular
laws
which
have
been
partially
adopted
by
our
own ,
or
which
are
by
custom
observed
in
certain
courts
and
jurisdictions .
By
leges
non scripta, I would
not be understood
to
mean
laws
merely
oral , or
communicated
from
former
ages to the present
solely by word of mouth .
It is true
indeed that , in the profound
ignorance
of letters which
formerly
overspread
the whole
western world , all
laws
were entirely
traditional , for this plain reason , because
the nations amongst which
they prevailed
had but little
(a) The term
common law " is
sometimes used
to signify the law
administered
in
courts of common
law,
i.e. ,
as
distinguished
from
equity ,
ecclesiastical ,
or
martial
law ;
and
is
sometimes
used
to
signify
the
unwritten
as
dis-
tinguished
from the statute law.

idea of writing .
Thus
the British
as well as the Gallic
Druids
committed
their
laws
as
well
as
learning
to
memory (b) ; and it is said of the primitive
Saxons here, as
well as of their brethren on the continent , that leges sold
memoriâ et usu retinebant (c).
But with us, at present ,
the monuments
and
evidences
of our legal customs are
contained in the records of the courts of justice , in books
of reports and judicial decisions , and in the
treatises of
learned
sages of the profession ,
preserved
and
handed
down to us from times of high antiquity.
However , I
style these parts of our law leges non scriptæ, because their
original institution
and authority
are not
set down in
writing , as acts of Parliament
are , but they receive
their
binding power , and the force of laws , by long and imme-
morial usage, and by their universal
reception throughout
the kingdom .
Our ancient lawyers , particularly
Fortescue (d) , insist
that these customs are as old
as the primitive Britons ,
and
continued
down , through the
several mutations
of
government
and
inhabitants , to the
present
time, un-
changed
and
unadulterated .
This may
possibly
be the
case
as to
some
few ;
but in general ,
as
Mr.
Selden
observes
( e) , this
assertion
must
be
understood
with
many grains of allowance ,
and only as signifying that
there never was any formal
exchange of one
system of
laws for another : though
doubtless , by the intermixture
of
adventitious
nations , the
Romans ,
the
Picts ,
the
Saxons , the Danes ,
and the Normans , customs peculiar
to them must have been
insensibly
introduced and incor-
porated with
those which
had
been
before
established
here ; thereby
in all probability
improving
the
texture "
and wisdom
of the whole by the
accumulated
wisdom
of
divers
particular
countries .
Our
laws ,
says
Lord
Bacon (),
are
mixed
as
our
language :
and as our

language
is so much
the richer , the laws are the more
complete .
" We ought
not perhaps to
suppose that
among
our
Saxon forefathers , any more than among ourselves , there
ever
existed
a complete
corpus juris
Anglici (g), ”
but
should
rather
imagine
that theirs , like our own , was a
customary
or common
law, comprising
records of deci-
sions to serve as precedents for the future , or enactments
passed in the Witena -gemôts for the repeal , confirmation ,
amendment , or completion of the existing law (h).
Portions of the laws of Alfred , framed in part upon the
Mercian
laws of Offa (i) , portions likewise of the laws of
Edward the Confessor , and of other Anglo - Saxon kings ,
in form more or less
authentic , yet remain to us ; and in
those ascribed
to king Henry I. , though
probably
com-
piled by a private
person , the laws and legal
usages
of
England,
as they
existed under
the Confessor , seem
to
have been collected .
The laws of the Confessor , if complete and genuine ,
would
have had for us a peculiar
interest ;
they
were
repeatedly
demanded by our ancestors ,
especially
under
Henry I., King
Stephen ,
and Henry II. , and
may in
some sense
be looked
on
as the origin of our common
or customary
law.
But
though
the
fragments
which
have come down to us
from Saxon
and Anglo- Saxon ,
or
even from
Norman
times , by no
means justify the
hypothesis
that
a legal
code
or assemblage of customs
at
all
approaching
to
completeness then
existed
here,
we may at all events affirm that from the date of Magna
Carta a body of laws , known
as the " Laws of England,"
has existed , drawn from many distinct
sources , and largely
permeated by feudal
doctrines , yet quite
independent of,
and owning no subservience to, any other code or system
ofjurisprudence
whatsoever .
Immeasurably
the most perfect body of law from which

our own
has borrowed
is the Roman (k) ;
but
to the
Saxons ,
the
Danes ,
and
Normans , we have yet
more
deeply
been
indebted , for
by
them
has
our
national
genius been bequeathed to us--by them have our liberties
been assured.
Vain certainly might be the effort to trace
each component
element in our laws and constitution to
its
proper
source
,
to
refer
to
its
true origin
each rule
or
maxim
,
which through revolving
ages has been sanctioned
.
This may
,
however
,
partially
be
done
,
and
as
regards the
parentage
of
leading
principles
,
speculations
may some-
times
be hazarded
,
with
a
well
-
grounded
conviction
that
they are just
.
We may believe
that the great principle
of
personal
liberty
,
the
inherent
love
of
freedom which
has vindicated
it
,
came
to
us
,
not
from our Roman con-
querors
,
but rather from those ruder tribes which
subse-
quently established themselves
amongst
us
.
It
is
to
our
Anglo
-
Saxon
ancestors
,
and
,
more remotely
,
to
the races
whence they sprung
,
that we are indebted for our funda-
mental liberties
.
But whatever
may
have been the
foundation
of
our
common law
,
many
of
the rules
and customs
composing
it
are
of
higher
antiquity
than
memory
or
history
can
reach
:
nothing being
more difficult than
to
ascertain the
precise beginning
and first spring
of
an ancient and long-
established
custom
.
Whence
it
is
that in our law the
goodness
of
a
custom depends upon its having
been used
time out
of
mind
;
or
in
the solemnity
of
our legal phrase
,
time whereof the memory of man runneth not
to
the con-
trary
(
).
This
it
is
which gives
it
its weight and autho-
rity
and
of
this nature are the rules
and customs which
in
part constitute
the common law

THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
must be
settled by
proceedings
and determinations
in the king's
ordinary
courts of justice
are guided and directed ; by these, for the
most part , are settled- the course in which lands descend
by inheritance ; the manner of acquiring
and transferring
property ;
the
solemnities
and obligation
of
contracts ;
the rules of expounding
wills , deeds , and
acts of parlia-
ment ; the
respective
remedies
for
civil
injuries
;
the
ingredients in some species of temporal
offences
; and an
infinite
number
of
minuter
particulars ,
which
diffuse
themselves
as extensively
as the ordinary distribution
of
common justice requires .
Thus , for example ,-that there
shall
be four superior
courts , the
chancery
(subdivided
by statute into various tribunals ) , the king's
bench , the
common pleas , and the exchequer ;-that
the eldest son
alone is heir to his ancestor ;-that a deed is of no validity
unless sealed and delivered ;-that wills shall be construed
more
favourably , and
deeds
more strictly ;
that
money
lent upon bond
is recoverable
by action of debt ;-that
breaking
the public
peace is an offence , and punishable
by fine and imprisonment
;-all these
are doctrines not
originally prescribed by any existing
statute or ordinance ,
but
dependent
upon
immemorial
usage, that
is , upon .
common law, for their support .
Some have divided
the common law into two principal
grounds or foundations :
1. Established
customs ; such as
the rule of primogeniture
: and
2. Established
rules and
maxims ; as , " the king can do no wrong ," " no man is
bound to accuse himself," and the like.
But I take these
to be one and the same thing.
For the authority of such
maxims rests entirely upon general reception and usage :
and the only method of proving , that this or that maxim
is a rule of the common law, is by showing
that it has
been always the custom to observe it.
But here
a very natural
and
very
material
question
judicial de
arises : how are these customs or maxims
to be known,
and by whom
is
their
validity to be determined ?
The
answer is, by the judges
in the
several courts of justice .

records.
They are the depositories of the laws ; the living oracles ,
who must decide in all cases of doubt , and who are bound
by oath to decide according
to the law of the land .
Their
knowledge
of that law is derived from experience
and
study ;
from
the
viginti
annorum
lucubrationes
, which
Fortescue
(m) mentions ; and from
being long personally
accustomed
to judicial
decisions
of their
predecessors
.
And indeed these judicial
decisions are the principal
and
most
authoritative
evidence
that
can be given of the
existence of such a custom
as shall form
a part of the
common law.
The judgment itself, and all the proceed- and pre-
ings previous thereto , are registered
and preserved under
our
public
the name
of
"

and
to
them
frequent recourse
is
had
,
when any critical question
arises in the
determination
of which former
precedents
may give light
or
assistance
.
Therefore
,
even
so
early
as
the Conquest
,
we find the præteritorum memoria
eventorum
,
reckoned up
as
one
of
the chief qualifications
of
those
,
who
were held
to
be

For
it
is
an
established
rule
to
abide
by former
precedents
,
where the
same points
come
again
in
litigation
;
as
well
to
keep the scale
of
justice
even and steady
,
and not liable
to
waver with every new judge's
opinion
;
as
also because
the law
in
that
case being
solemnly declared and deter-
mined
,
what before was uncertain
,
and perhaps indifferent
,
is
now become
a
permanent
rule
,
which
it
is
not in the
breast
of
any
subsequent judge
to
alter
or
vary
from
,
according
to
his private
sentiments
;
he
being
sworn
to
determine
,
not according

his
own private
judgment
,
but according
to
the known laws and customs of the land
;
not delegated
to
pronounce
a
new law
,
but
to
maintain
and expound the old one
.
Yet this rule admits
of
excep-
tion
,
where the former
determination
is
most evidently
contrary
to

much more

THE LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old
one from misrepresentation .
For if it be found
that the
former
decision
is manifestly
absurd
or unjust , it is de-
clared not that
such a sentence
was bad law, but that it
was not law ; that is , that it is not the established custom
of the realm , as has been erroneously determined .
And
hence it is that our lawyers
are with justice
so copious in
their encomiums
on the reason of the common law ; that
they tell us, that the law is the perfection of reason, that
it always intends to conform thereto , and that what is not
reason is not law.
Not that the particular
reason of every
rule in the law can at this distance of time
be always
precisely
assigned ;
but it
is
sufficient
that
there
be
nothing
in the
rule
flatly contradictory
to reason , and
then the law will presume it to be well founded (p) .
And
it has been an ancient observation , that whenever a stand-
ing rule of law , of which the reason
perhaps could not be
remembered
or discerned , has been wantonly
broken in
upon by statutes or new resolutions , the
wisdom of the
rule has in the end appeared from the inconveniences that
have followed the innovation .
The doctrine of the law then is this : that precedents
and rules must in general be followed , unless flatly absurd
or unjust
for though their reason be not obvious at first
view , yet we owe such a deference
to former judges as not
to suppose that they acted wholly without consideration (q) .
To illustrate this doctrine by an example . It was deter-
mined , centuries
ago , that any material
alteration
of a
bond made in it even by a stranger , without the knowledge
of the obligee , nullifies
the instrument
(r).
Now this is
a positive law, fixed
and
established by custom , which

custom
is evidenced by judicial
decisions ; and therefore
can never be departed from by any modern judge without
a breach of his oath.
And herein there is nothing
repug-
nant to natural
justice
; though
the reason of it may not
be quite obvious to everybody.
Nevertheless , it would not
be in the power of a modern judge, on account of a sup-
posed hardship upon the innocent obligee , to alter the rule
which has
been
stated .
And if any court
were now to
determine , that under
the
circumstances
mentioned
the
bond was nevertheless valid , no subsequent judges would
scruple to declare that
such prior determination
was un-
just , was unreasonable , and therefore
was not law .
The
law , indeed , and the opinion of the judge , are not always
convertible terms , or one and the same thing ; since some-
times the judge may mistake the law.
As a general rule ,
however , the decisions of courts of justice
are the evidence
of what is common law : in the same
manner
as , in the
civil law , what
the emperor had
once
determined was to
serve as a guide for the future (s).
Not only are precedents to be followed , but in resolving
a new point the argument
from analogy may be resorted
to .
Thus Lord Bacon , speaking of cases omitted in law,
says, (t) that " the narrow compass of man's wisdom cannot
comprehend
all
cases which
time
hath
found
out ," and
therefore
cases
omitted
and new do often present them-
selves , but every new case does not require a new law ; if
so ,
the
legislative
power would
have to be continually
exercised .
But though
it differs
from former
cases in
circumstances , yet it may fall under a general rule , or be
proceeded upon by parity of reasoning , ubi est eadem ratio
―ibi idem est jus (u).
Yet , although the argument
from
(s) Si imperalis majestas causam
cognitionaliter

But how is

sense , that discretion (y) , which a mind imbued with legal
principles
brings
to bear in determining
what is just
by
calling in aid also considerations of expediency and public
policy ;
and the argument
ab inconvenienti
, which
Lord
Coke , in commenting
on Littleton (z), commends .
For
solving
a
difficulty ,
such
as
supposed,
three
practical
suggestions may be offered .
1st. A case may be altogether
new, or primæ impressionis , and yet may disclose a right
vested in the complainant
to avail himself of a remedy
by action , by suit, or perhaps by motion
to the Court.
2ndly . Nevertheless , if a case in specie , such as that pro-
(x)
An
instance
exemplifying
what is said supra
occurs in Entick
v.
Carrington
,
19
St.
Tr.
1029,
where it
was
held that a warrant
issued by
a Secretary
of State
to
search for and
seize the
papers of
one
accused of having
published
a
seditious libel, is illegal .
It is well
known that a justice
of the peace
may grant
a warrant
to search for
stolen goods , upon information
that
a
theft
has
been
committed , and
that the
goods
are
concealed in a
certain
place ; and
when
such
a
warrant
is granted ,
the
constable
or officer
executing it may
break
open
doors and boxes to search for
the goods stolen .
In Entick v. Car-
rington
it was argued-and
appa-
rently with
much
confidence -for
the defendants , that
a Secretary of
State must possess at least an equal
degree of power ,
for
protection
of
the
commonwealth , to
issue
his
warrant
to
search
for
and
seize
seditious
papers ,
as
a
magistrate
possesses in regard to stolen
goods .
And Lord
Camden
admitted
that
the former
case did
bear a resem-
blance to the latter, though he pro-
ceeded to distinguish
between them
by reasoning which seems to be in
controvertible
.
Accordingly
the
argument
from
analogy ,
or
what
Lord Coke
calls the argumentum
à
simili , and which he says valet in
lege (Co. Litt. 191), should
be used
with due caution .
(y) " Discretion ,"
said
Lord
Mansfield , in Wilkes's
case, 4 Burr.
2539, " when
applied
to a court of
law, means sound discretion
guided
by law. It must
be governed
by
rule , not by humour .
It must
not
be arbitrary , vague ,
and
fanciful,
but legal and regular ."

Attention
, therefore ,
should
critically
be given to such

3rdly. The
apparent
hardship which
might result from deciding
on
particular facts in the way indicated
by law, ought not to
be allowed to warp or unduly
influence the opinion of the
student who speculates , or of the counsel who

of the judge who adjudicates
on a case .
Hard

has been sometimes said , make bad law (b).

as authentic
cases,
records , but
are
handed
out to public
view in the nu-
merous
volumes
of

which
furnish
the
lawyer's
library.
These reports
are histories of the several cases ,
with a short
summary of the facts , the proceedings
and
pleadings in them , the arguments
on both
sides , and the
reasons
which
the
court

for
its judgment

are known

And it is to be wished
that this beneficial custom had , under proper regulations ,
been uninterruptedly
continued
to this
day ; but though
king James I. , at the instance of Lord Bacon , appointed
two paid reporters (c) for the purpose of noting down the
decisions of the law courts , yet that wise
institution
was
soon neglected , and from the reign of Henry VIII . to the

anddigested
by the sages
(perhaps contradictory ) accounts of
one
and the
same
determination .
Some of the most valuable of the ancient
reports are those published
by lord chief justice
Coke ; a
man of infinite learning in his profession , though
not a
little
infected
with the
pedantry
and quaintness of the
times in which
he lived .
However ,
his
reports
are so
highly esteemed , that they are generally cited without
the
author's name (d).
Recently under the auspices of a council
composed of
leading members of the bar , reporters have been appointed
for each of the
principal
courts of law and equity , who
will henceforth furnish authentic
records of proceedings
in them .
Besides
the
reporters ,
there
are
certain
writers
to
of
the
law
.
whom great veneration
and respect are paid by students
of the law
.
Such are Glanville and Bracton
,
Britton and
Fleta
,
Hengham
and Littleton
,
Statham
,
Brooke
,
Fitz-
herbert
,
and
Staundforde
,
with some others
of
ancient
date
;
whose treatises
are cited
as
authority
,
and
as
evi-
dence that
cases
have formerly
occurred
in
which
such
and such points were
determined
,
which
are now become
settled
and first principles
.
One of the last
of these
methodical writers
in
point
of
time
,
whose works are
of
any intrinsic authority
in
courts
of
justice
,
and
do
not
entirely
depend
on
the strength
of
their quotations
from
older authors
,
is
the learned
judge
just
mentioned
,
sir
Edward
Coke
;
who has written
four volumes of institutes
,
as
he
is
pleased
to
call them
,
though they have little
of
the institutional method to warrant
such
a
title
.
The
first volume
is
a
very extensive
comment
upon an excel-
lent little treatise
of
tenures
,
compiled
by Judge Little-
ton
,
in
the reign
of
Edward IV
.
This comment
is
a
rich
mine
of
valuable
common
law learning
,
collected
and
heaped together from the ancient

but greatly defective in method (e) .
The second
volume
is a comment upon many
old acts of parliament , without
any
systematical
order ;
the third,
a more
methodical
treatise of the
pleas of the
crown ; and the fourth, an
account of the several species of courts (f).
And thus much
for the first
ground
and chief corner
stone of the laws of England , which
is general immemo-
rial custom or common law , from time to time declared
in the decisions of the
courts of justice ; which decisions
are preserved among
our public records , explained in our
reports , and digested for general
use in the authoritative
writings of the venerable sages of the law .
The laws of the Roman people as practised in the times
of their liberty,
paid
also
a great
regard to
custom ;
adopting it, however , only when the written law was defi-
cient ; but the reasons alleged in the digest (g) will fully
justify
our
own
practice , in
making
the unwritten
of
equal authority
with , when it is not
contradicted by , the
written law.
" For since,"
says Julianus , " the written
law binds us for no other reason but because it is approved
by the judgment of the people, therefore those laws which
the people have approved without writing
ought also to
bind every body.
For
where is the difference , whether
the people declare their assent to a law by suffrage or by
a uniform
course of acting accordingly ? "
Thus did they
reason while Rome had some remains of her freedom ; but
when the imperial
tyranny
came to be fully established ,
the
civil laws
speak
a very different
language .

And
indeed it is
one of the
characteristic
marks of English
liberty , that our common law depends
upon
custom ;
which
carries with it this
internal
evidence of freedom ,
that it probably
was
introduced
and maintained
by the
voluntary
consent of the people.

branch of the unwritten
laws of England
comprises particular

or laws
which affect only

lar customs
affecting
particular
persons.
These particular
customs , or some of them , are without
doubt the
remains
of that
multitude
of local
customs
before mentioned , out of which
a body of law was col-
lected by king Alfred , by king Edgar, and by Edward
the Confessor :-each district sacrificing
some
of its own
special
usages , in order
that
the whole
kingdom
might
enjoy the benefit of one
uniform
and universal
system of
laws .
But for reasons that have
been
long
forgotten ,
particular
counties , cities , towns , manors , and lordships ,
were very early indulged with the privilege
of abiding by
their own customs , in contradistinction
to the rest of the
nation at large
which privilege
is confirmed to them by
several
acts of parliament (m).
:
Such
is the
custom
of gavelkind
in Kent
and
some
other parts of the kingdom , which
ordains , among other
prince
that some of his royal ances-
tors had endeavoured
to
introduce
the civil law into this
country , be-
cause, says the
author , " in that
law the
prince's
pleasure
standeth
in force of a law ; but the laws
of
England admit
no such maxim , or
anything
equivalent
to it."
One
of
the
articles
of
impeachment
against Wolsey was, that
he had
endeavoured
to
subvert
" anti-
quissimas
leges hujus
regni , uni-
versum -que hoc regnum legibus im-
perialibus
subjicere."

highly
extolled
the civil law, and
made no
secret
of his
attachment
to
its
arbitrary
doctrines
and
maxims
on all points
of kingcraft.
It was also somewhat encouraged by
Charles I. under the advice of Laud.

sons
alike : and
that, though
the
ancestor be attainted
and
hanged , yet
the heir shall
succeed
to his
estate , without
any escheat
to the lord .
Such is the custom
that prevails
in divers
ancient
boroughs , and therefore called borough -English ,
that the youngest son shall
inherit the
estate , in prefer-
ence
to all his
elder
brothers .- Such
is the
custom in
other
boroughs
that
a widow
shall be entitled , for her
dower , to all her husband's lands ; whereas at the common
law she shall be endowed of one-third part
only .- Such
also are the special and particular
customs of manors , of
which every one has more or less , and which
bind all the
copyhold
and customary
tenants of the
said
manors.—
Such likewise
is the custom of holding
inferior
courts ,
with power of trying causes , in divers
cities and trading
towns ; the right of holding which , when
no royal grant
can
be
shown , depends
entirely
upon
immemorial
and
established
usage.- Such ,
lastly,
are
many
particular
customs within the city of London
with regard to trade
apprentices ,
widows ,
orphans ,
and
a
variety
of other
matters .
All these are
contrary
to the
general
law of
the land , and are good only by special usage ; though the
customs of London
have
been
confirmed by Act of Par-
liament (n).
The rules relating to particular
customs regard either ( 1)

As to gavelkind

that in the manor

their own behalf (s) .
When a custom
is actually
proved to exist , the
next
inquiry is into the legality
of it ; for , if it is not a good
custom , it ought
to
be no
longer
used.
Malus
usus
abolendus
est is an established maxim of the law ( †) .
To
make a particular
custom good , the following are neces-
sary requisites :-
1. That it have been used so long , that the memory of
man
runneth
not to the contrary .
So that, if any one
can show the beginning of it , it is no good custom .
Such
is the rule
at
common law, whence it follows
that
no
custom can prevail
against an express
act of parliament
;
since the statute itself is proof of a time when the custom
did not exist (u).

THE
CUSTOMARY
LAW .

Legal memory refers back to the first year of the reign
of king Richard I. , a period so remote as to render neces-
sary some modification of the rule
above
stated.
A jury
therefore
was
formerly
held
justified
in presuming
the
immemorial
existence of a custom on proof being adduced
that it had existed for a much less period- ex. gr . for the
period
of twenty years (x), in the
absence
of
evidence
to rebut
such presumption .
But this
state of the law
being
deemed
unsatisfactory , the statute 2 & 3 Will . 4 ,
c.
71 , was passed , which in a large class of cases shortens
the legal
time of prescription
to
twenty
years, making
undisturbed
usage for that period a bar or title in itself ,
unless
enjoyed in virtue of
an agreement between the
parties .

Any interruption

cause
a temporary
ceasing
the revival gives it a new beginning , which will
be within
time
of memory ,
and
thereupon
the
custom
will be void .
But this
must
be understood with regard
to an interruption
of the right ; for an interruption
of the
possession only , for ten or twenty years , will not destroy
the custom (y).
As if the inhabitants
of a parish
have
a customary right of watering
their
cattle
at
a certain
pool , the custom is not destroyed , though they do not use
it for ten years ; it only becomes
more difficult
to prove :
but if the right
be
any how discontinued
for a day, the
custom is quite at an end .
A custom
originating
before
the time of memory and continuously
recognised down to
our
own times has in fact

reasonable,
4. A custom must
be reasonable (b) ;
or rather , taken
negatively , it must
not be unreasonable ; which
is not
always , as Sir Edward
Coke
says (c) , to be understood of
every unlearned
man's
reason, but of artificial
and legal
reason, warranted
by authority
of law.
Upon which
account a custom
may
be good ,
though
the particular
reason of it cannot
be assigned ;
for it
suffices , if no
good legal
reason can be assigned
against it.
Thus
a
custom in a parish that
no man
shall
put his beasts into
the common till the third of October , would be good ; and
yet it might be hard
to show
the reason why that day in
particular
is fixed upon ,
rather
than the day before or
after.
But a custom , that no
cattle shall be put in till
the lord of the manor
has first put in his , is unreason-
able, and therefore bad : for peradventure
the lord will
never put in his ; and then the tenants will
lose all their
profits (d).
The
following
cases
will
further
exemplify
what
is
meant by the
reasonableness
or unreasonableness of a
custom :-A custom for the lord , the owner of coal mines
within the manor , to dig the mines and lay the rubbish
in heaps
near the pits upon the surface of land being cus-
tomary
tenements
and
parcel of the
manor ,
there
to
remain and continue at the will and pleasure of the lord ,
has been held bad ; because
the right claimed involved the
destruction of the whole profits of the land , and it would
therefore be
unreasonable
to presume
a reservation
so
entirely
inconsistent with the grant of the tenements (e).
And
a custom which would
have
enabled
the
lord to
undermine the houses of the copyholders , and , without any
notice to them , to cause their houses
to fall , no compen-

sation being made for the damage thus
caused , was held
to be unreasonable and void (f) .
On the other hand , the
following custom was held not to be unreasonable :
That
every
liege
subject of the realm
exercising
the trade or
calling of a victualler , might enter upon that part of the
waste of a manor upon which a fair by prescription
was
appointed
to be held , and there , for the convenient carry-
ing on of his trade ,
erect a booth
and stall , and place
posts
and
tables there , and continue the same
so erected
until the
termination
of the fair so holden , yielding and
paying to the lord of the manor
the
sum of two-pence
when lawfully demanded (g) .
5. A custom ought to be certain ( ).
A custom , that certain,
lands
shall
descend to the
most
worthy of the owner's
blood , is void ; for how shall this worth
be determined ?
but a custom that they shall
descend
to the next male of
the blood ,
exclusive of females , is certain , and therefore
good (i).
A custom to pay two -pence
an
acre in lieu of
tithes
is good ;
but to pay
sometimes
two -pence
and
sometimes
three -pence ,
as
the
occupier
of
the land
pleases, is bad for its uncertainty .
Yet a custom to pay
a year's
improved value for a fine on a copyhold
estate is
good ;
though
the
value is a thing uncertain
: for the
value may at any time be ascertained ; and the maxim of
law is id certum
est, quod certum reddi potest (j).
A custom , for all the
customary
tenants of
a manor
having gardens , parcels of their estates , to take pasturable
turf at
all
times
when
necessary ,
and
in
unlimited
quantity , from a waste within the manor , for making and
repairing
grass -plots in their gardens for the

ment

(k) Wilson v. Willes , 7 East , 121.
(1) Marquis of Salisbury v. Glad-
stone,
9 H. L. Cas . 692, where , in
answer to the
argument
that the
custom stated supra
was unreason-
able as tending
to the
destruction
or annihilation
of the lord's land ,
Lord Cranworth
said :-" It is true
that a custom , to be valid , must
be
reasonable . It is not easy to define
the
meaning of the
word
reason-
able ' when
applied
to
a
custom
regulating
the
relation
between a
lord
and
his
copyholders .
That
relation
must have had its origin in
remote times by agreement between
the lord as absolute
owner
of the
whole
manor
in
fee simple ,
and
those whom he was content to allow
to
occupy
portions
of it
as
his
tenants
at will .
The rights
of these
tenants
must
have
depended
in
their
origin
entirely
on the will of
the lord , and it is hard
to say how
any
stipulations
regulating
such
rights
can, as between
the
tenant
and
the
lord , be
deemed void
as
being unreasonable .
Cujus estdare
ejus
est disponere .
Whatever
re-
strictions , therefore , or conditions ,
the
lord
may
have
imposed ,
or
whatever
rights
the
tenants
may
have
demanded , all
were
within
the competency
of the lord to grant
or of the tenants
to stipulate
for.
And if it were possible to show that
before the time of legal
memory
any lawful arrangement
had
been
actually
come to between
the
lord
and his
tenants
as to the terms on
which the latter should
hold their
lands ,
and that
arrangement
had
been
afterwards
constantly
acted
on, I do not see how it could
ever
be treated as being void
because it
was unreasonable .
In truth , I be-
lieve
that when it is said that a
custom is void
because it
is
un-
reasonable , nothing
more is meant
than
that
the
unreasonable
cha-
racter
of the
alleged
custom
con-
clusively
proves
that
the
usage,
even though
it may
have
existed
immemorially
,
must
have resulted
from
accident
or
indulgence ,
and
not from
any right
conferred
in
ancient
times
on the party setting
up the
custom .
The
custom
here
insisted
on
is
one
which
affects
no

The
deference
to
mercantile
customs
and
usages
on
many occasions
shown by our judicial tribunals
is curious.
and worthy of regard .
In former times (though the prac-
tice
latterly
has
sunk into
desuetude) it was no un-
common thing for a judge to confer , touching
points of
mercantile law, with those supposed to be conversant with
it ;
thus , Lord Chancellor
Hardwicke
is reported
( t)
to
have consulted with merchants who had been examined as
witnesses in a cause upon the point which there called for
adjudication
, and the decree subsequently made by him in
the
case
was moulded in accordance with their
opinion .
Again , a question of some importance having
arisen upon
a sea policy
of insurance , Lord
Mansfield (u ) observed ,
that " in all
mercantile
transactions
the great
object
should
be certainty , and
therefore it is of more conse-
quence that a rule should
be certain than whether the
rule be established one way or another ."
Accordingly, in
the
case
sub judice , his
lordship
consulted
persons
con-
versant with mercantile
affairs , and thus
allowed
himself
to be guided to a conclusion .
Mercantile
law consists

that, in courts

in

was
thrown
together ;
they
were
left
generally
to a jury , and
they
pro-
duced
no

principle.
From that time
we all know the
great
study has been to find
some
certain
general
principles , which
shall be known
to all mankind , not
only to rule the particular
case then
under consideration , but to serve as
a guide for the future .
Most of u

of usages
existing
amongst merchants , such usages being
either general
or local .
The distinction
, indeed , is ob-
vious
between a general
and
a merely
local
usage ; for
instance , between a course of practice
recognised
as inci-
dent to a bill of exchange and a custom prevailing
at a
particular
stock market , or at a particular
port .
A local
custom may , by being tacitly incorporated with
a contract ,
be, in truth, a law to the contracting
parties ; yet such a
custom must , when relied
upon ,
be established
by evi-
dence , and will not be taken judicial notice of without
proof .
On the other hand , " When a general
usage
has
been judicially ascertained
and
established , it becomes
a
part of the law merchant , which
courts
of justice
are
bound to know and recognise .
Such
has been the inva-
riable
understanding
and
practice in Westminster
Hall
for a great many years ; there
is no decision
or dictum to
the
contrary ;
and justice
could
not be administered if
evidence were required to be given toties quoties
to support
such usages if issue might be joined
upon them in each
particular
case ” (x).
On the other hand ,
a usage of trade prevailing
in
a
particular
place must be proved at Nisi Prius by the party
seeking to avail himself of it, though the validity of the
custom
may be disputed
on the ground
that it is unrea-
sonable (y) or indefinite
; and the inference
that parties
contracting
at , or in
reference
to ,
the
place where the
custom
exists mean to be bound by it, may be rebutted

canon laws.
Authority of the civil and
canon laws .
These
are
set
forth
in the
pandects , the
codes , and the institutes ; and enforced by
councils , decrees , and decretals ,
as
also by an immense
number of expositions , glosses , decisions , and treatises of
the learned in both branches of the law .
Nevertheless it is not on account of their being written
laws , that either the canon law, or the civil law, has any
obligation
within this
kingdom :
neither
do their force
and
efficacy
depend upon
their
own intrinsic authority .
They
bind
not
the
subjects of England,
because
their
materials
were collected from
popes
or
emperors ;
were
digested by Justinian ,
or
declared
to be authentic
by
Gregory .
These considerations
give them
no authority
here
for the legislature of England does not , nor ever did
recognise any foreign power as superior or equal
to it in
this kingdom
; or as having the right to give law to any ,
the meanest,
of its
subjects .
But the
strength
which
either
the
papal , or imperial
laws
have obtained in this
realm , is thus far only that they have
been
admitted
and
received by immemorial
usage and custom in some parti-
cular
cases , and
some
particular
courts ; or else , because
they
are in some other
cases
introduced
by consent of
parliament , and then they owe their validity to
our
leges
scriptæ, or statute law.
This
is expressly declared in
those remarkable
words of the statute 25 Henry
8 ,
c. 21 ,
addressed to the king's majesty-" This is your
grace's
realm , recognising
no superior
under God
but
only your
grace , hath been and is free from subjection to any man's
laws , but only
to such as have been
devised , made , and
ordained within this realm for the wealth of the same ; or
to such other as , by sufferance
of your grace and your pro-
genitors , the people of this your realm have taken at their
free liberty, by
their
own consent, to be
used among
them ;
and
have bound
themselves
by long
use
and
custom to the
observance
of the same :

as to the
observance of the laws of any foreign prince , potentate , or
prelate ; but as to the customed and ancient laws of this

realm , originally established
as laws of the same, by the
said sufferance, consents
, and custom'; and none otherwise ."
By the " civil " law, is generally
understood
the civil The Roman
or municipal
law of the
Roman
empire , as comprised in
the institutes , the
code
and the digest
of the
emperor
Justinian ,
and
the
novel
constitutions
of himself and
some of his successors
.
Of which , as there will frequently
be occasion to cite them , it may not be amiss to give a
short and general account.
The law of Rome (b) (founded first upon the regal con-
stitutions of its ancient kings , next upon the twelve tables
of the decemviri , then upon the laws
or statutes enacted
by the senate or people , the
edicts of the prætor , and the
responsa prudentum , or opinions
of learned lawyers , and
lastly upon the
imperial
decrees , or constitutions
of suc-
cessive
emperors) had
grown to
so great
a bulk
as
to
render
applicable
to it the expression of Livy (c) , “ im-
mensus aliarum
super alias
ascervatarum legum cumulus ."
This evil was in part remedied by the collections of two
private
lawyers ,
Gregorius
and
Hermogenes ;
and then The Theo-
by the emperor Theodosius the younger , by whose orders
a code was compiled , A.D. 438 , being a methodical
collec-
tion
of
imperial
constitutions , with
emendations
and
retrenchments
;
this
Theodosian
code
was
promulgated
in the western
as well as in the
eastern
empire ; and to
this it is probable
that the Franks and Goths paid much
regard
in framing
legal
constitutions
for their
newly-
erected
kingdoms .
For
Justinian
commanded
only in
the eastern remains of the empire ; and it was under his
auspices that
the
body of civil law was
compiled
and
finished
by Tribonian
and other lawyers , a.D.
533 (d).

of which , however , gra-
dually fell into neglect and oblivion , till it revived about
the middle of the twelfth century , when the policy of the
Roman
ecclesiastics gave new vogue and authority
to the
civil law, introduced
it into several
nations ,

In determining , however , the extent of our obligations

not solely be
influenced by
the number of direct
references
to it, which
we may find
in the reports ; nor must we rest satisfied with extracting
from them cases which
may have been
expressly decided
in accordance with the opinions of lawyers
collected
and
classified in the digest ; we must
regard
also
the general
influence which
so refined a body of law as that of Rome
may
have
exercised
when the cruder
notions
of juris-
prudence ,
derived
from Teutonic
nations ,
had
become
gradually
capable of being
systematised ,
polished ,
and
improved .
We must , in short , regard
the
broad prin-
ciples
discernible
in
certain
branches of our laws ,
and
compare them with such as
in
corresponding
portions of
the more ancient
code
may be apparent .

THE
LAWS
OF ENGLAND .
The canon
law.
distant
epochs
and upon
independent
reasoning
applied
fortuitously
to similar states of facts similar or identical
rules
of law- but
rather
that
our
modern jurists
have
largely
benefited
by the
laborious
researches
of their
predecessors -that the fruit of " collective wisdom " has
not been put aside untasted (n).
Yet whilst acknowledging that we have largely borrowed
from the Roman law , we must not ascribe to it any direct
intrinsic authority
binding
on our courts ; for instance , in
Ball v. Herbert ( o) , the question was : Have the public at
common law (irrespective of custom ) a right to tow vessels
on either bank of an ancient navigable
river ?
Does any
such right exist at common law as evidenced
by the judg-
ments of our courts and the opinions
of learned writers ?
In support of an
affirmative
answer to this
question , a
passage
was cited from
Bracton , who , speaking
of navi-
gable rivers , says , Riparum etiam usus publicus
est, jure
gentium , sicut ipsius fluminis.
This passage
from Bracton
(quoted by
Callis, the
great
authority
on
the law of
sewers ) , " plainly appears ," said Buller , J. , " to have been
taken from the Roman
law ( p) , and whether or not that
has been adopted by our
common law is to be
seen by
looking into our books-and there it is not to be found ."
Accordingly
, the Court of Queen's Bench decided , in Ball
v. Herbert , against the existence of the right which
was
asserted.
The canon law
is a body of Roman
ecclesiastical
law,
relative
to
such
matters
as
that
church
either
has ,
or
pretends to
have,
the
proper jurisdiction
over.
It is
compiled
from
the opinions of the ancient Latin fathers ,

In
deciding
a
case upon
principle
where
no
direct
authority
can be cited
from
our
books , it affords
no
small
evi-
dence of the soundness of the conclu-
sion come to , if it proves to be sup-
ported by the civil law , " the fruit of
the
researches
of the
most learned
men , the collective wisdom
of ages,
and the groundwork
of the

cipal

About the year 1151 , Gratian ,

he entitled

Henry V.; and adopted also by the province
of York (g)
in the reign
of Henry VI. (r) .
At the
dawn of the
Reformation , in the reign of king Henry VIII . , it was
enacted in parliament
(s) that a review should
be had of
the canon law by a commission
composed
of ecclesiastics
and laymen , with power to abrogate and confirm , and that
such portion
as should be approved and
found consistent
with the law of England , should
be valid
and in force ;
and
further ,
that
until
such
commission
should
have
accomplished the work assigned to it, the
existing
canon
law, in so far as it was not repugnant
to the laws of the
realm , should be exercised
.
This
statute of Henry was
confirmed
by the
1 Eliz . c. 1.
Intermediately
, however ,
between the passing and confirmation of that statute , viz . ,
in the third year of Edward VI . , commissioners , composed
of members as well lay as ecclesiastical , had

judgment
of his
highness
and of thirty -two of his
highness ' subjects , whereof
sixteen
were to be of the clergy ; and
that
such
constitutions

canons as
should
be thought
and
determined
by the said two -and -thirty persons ,
or the more part of them , worthy
to
be

said
two -and
thirty , or the
more
part of them ,
should
be approved
to stand with
the laws of God , and
consonant
to
the laws of this realm , should
stand
in their full strength and power , the
king's most royal assent being first
had and obtained to the same. This
ecclesiastical
commission
was
ex-
tended by 27 Hen . 8, c. 15, beyond
the then session of parliament , and
by 35 Hen. 8, c. 16, during

work was prevented by the king's death (t).
The review
thus
projected
of the
canon
law
never
having
been
effected ,
its
authority
in
England depends mainly upon
the statutes which have been cited

It
is

true that at the

certain
constitutions

were

to
which Lord
Hardwicke

declared
,
that
"
not
having been confirmed by parliament
,
they do not proprio

are

nevertheless
,
many
provisions
contained
in
these canons which are declaratory

,
in
that
respect and by
virtue
of

is

The opposition of the judges to the Articuli
Cleri , pre-
sented by archbishop
Bancroft
on behalf of the clergy ,
A.D.
1605 , and to the pretensions of the ecclesiastics
in their
attempted
infringements
on the common law, was very
resolute (2 ) ; and the statute of Merton , already cited (a) ,
with Lord Coke's
commentary upon it, shows that at a
much earlier date the doctrines of the canon law had not
been allowed
to prevail
against
the law of England , yet
sometimes
our
courts
have
expressly
appealed
to the
canon, as they have done to the civil, law, to guide
them
under peculiar
circumstances (b) ; and where the Roman
law and the canon law differ , our common law holds itself
free, if so inclined , to elect between them .

v. Vardill , 5 B. & C. 438 ; 2 Cl . &
F. 571 ; 7 Id . 895, where the question
was mooted , whether
a child
born
in Scotland of unmarried
parents ,
who subsequently
intermarried
, was
capable of inheriting land
in Eng-
land ?
He was held
not to be so.
" One
rule ,"
said
Littledale, J. ,
" applicable
to
every course of de-
scent is, that the heir must be born
in
lawful
matrimony .
That was
settled
by the Statute
of Merton ,
and we cannot
allow the comity of
nations
to prevail
against it."
(b) In Rennell
v. Bishop
of Lin-
coln , 3 Bing . 272, 273,
Best , C. J. ,
observes :-"If it be
asked what
have the judges of the common law ,
when giving judgment
in an action
of quare
impedit , to
do with the
canon law, I answer , that where the
right of presentation
is derived from
the
church
[as it was in the case
sub judice ], it can only be decided
by that law.
Ecclesiastical
presen-
tations
having
no connection
with
lay property , but
existing
only as
rights of the church , are governed
by the laws of the
church .
The
ecclesiastical law is for the decision
of
such
questions ,
and
must
be
taken notice of by the judges of the
courts of common
law in
deciding
them .
Tithes are a spiritual
right ,
and as such they were originally re-
coverable
only in the
ecclesiastical
courts .
Actions
may
now
be
brought for subtraction
of tithes in
the
courts of
common
law,
but
those courts , in deciding what tithes
are due, and
how they ought to be
set
out , consult
the
ecclesiastical
law."

THE
STATUTE
LAW.
89
ment .
At
present
we will
only
take
notice
of the
different
kinds of statutes ; and of some
general rules of
policy and construction with regard to them (n) .
Private.
First ,
as to their several
kinds .
Statutes are either Public acts.
public
or private (0) .
A public
act is , strictly speaking ,
an universal
rule ,
that
regards
the
whole
community .
Private acts
are rather exceptions
than
rules , being those
special or
which only operate upon
particular
persons, and private
concerns
such as the Romans entitled
senatus -decreta , in
contradistinction
to the
senatus -consulta , which regarded
the whole community (p).
Thus , to show the distinction
,
the
statute
13 Eliz . c.
10 , to prevent
spiritual
persons
from
making
leases
for
longer
terms
than
twenty - one
years , or three lives , is a public
act ; it being
a rule pre-
scribed to the whole
body
of
spiritual
persons
in
the
nation
but an act
to
enable the
bishop of Chester to
make a lease to A. B. for sixty years , concerns only the
parties
and the bishop's
successors
;
and is
therefore a
private
act.
Every act, however, is now to be
deemed
public , and is to be judicially
noticed
unless
otherwise
declared (9) .
(n) The method of citing
acts of
parliament
is various .
Many of our
ancient
statutes are called
after the
name of the
place where
the par-
liament
was held that made them ;
as
the
statutes
of
Merton
and
Marleberge , of Westminster
,
Glou-
cester, and Winchester
.
Others are
denominated
from their subject ; as
the statutes of Wales
and Ireland ,
the articuli cleri , and
the præroga-
tiva regis .
Some are distinguished
by
their
initial
words ,
as
the
statutes of quia
emptores, and that
of circumspecte
agatis .
But
the
most
usual
method
of
citing
a
statute is by naming
the year of the
king's reign in which it was made ,
together
with
the
chapter
or par-
ticular act , according to its numeral
order , as 9
Geo. 2,
c. 4.
All the
acts of
one session of
parliament
taken
together
make
properly
but
one statute ; and ,
therefore , when
two sessions have been held in one
year , we usually
mention
stat . 1 or
Thus the Bill of Rights is cited
as 1 W. & M. st . 2, c. 2, signifying
that it is the second
chapter
or act
of the
second
statute , or the laws
made in the
second session of par-
liament
in the first year
of king
William and queen Mary.

THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
Declaratory.
Remedial.
In parliamentary
language ,
statutes
are
further
sub-
divided as follows
: Public acts are subdivided into general ,
as the Reform Act , the annual Mutiny Act , &c.; local , as
church building acts , canal and railway
acts , parish
acts ,
county acts , &c.; and personal , as
patent
acts , attainder
acts , &c.
Private
acts
are subdivided into local , as enclo-
sure acts, &c.; and personal , as estate
acts , naturalisation
acts ,
&c. (r) .
The printed
statutes
are also , for
conve-
nience of reference and citation , classed
under four heads ,
viz .: public general acts ; local acts declared public
; pri-
vate
acts , printed
by the queen's
printer ,
and whereof
the printed
copies
may be given in evidence ; and private
acts not printed .
A statute is sometimes designated
as declaratory ,
or
remedial , or penal , or repealing .
Declaratory , where the
old
custom of the kingdom having
almost
fallen into
disuse ,
or
become
disputable ,
parliament
has
thought
proper , in perpetuum rei testimonium
, and for avoiding all
doubts and difficulties , to
declare what the
common
law
is and
ever has been (s ).
Thus the statute of Treasons ,
25
Edw .
3,
c.
2 ,
does
not
make
any
new
species
of
treasons ; but only , for the benefit of the subject , declares
and
enumerates
those
several
kinds
of
offence
which
before were treason at the
common law.
Remedial
sta-
tutes are those which
are
made to supply
such
defects ,
and abridge
such superfluities , in the common
law,
as
arise either from
the general
imperfection
of all human
laws , from
change of time
and circumstances , from the
mistakes
and unadvised
determinations
of unlearned
(or
even learned ) judges , or from any other cause whatsoever .
66
(r)
Whether an act is public or
private (meaning thereby local
and
personal ,
as
opposed
to
general ),
does not depend upon any technical
considerations
(such
as
having
a
clause
or declaration
that the
act
shall be deemed a public
act ), but
upon
the
nature
and
substance of
the
case."

V.-C. ,

Cock v. Gent, 12 M. & W. 234.

THE

And this being done, either by enlarging the common law
where it was too narrow
and
circumscribed ,
or by re-
straining it where it was too lax and luxuriant , has occa-
sioned
a subdivision of remedial
acts
of parliament
into
enlarging
and
restraining ,

enabling

disabling

statutory law (u).
Such
being the
mode of classifying
and
designating
statutes , it may not be amiss to add a few observations
concerning
the construction and interpretation
of them .
tion of laws
When
any
doubt
arose upon the
construction
of the Interpreta-
Roman
laws ,
the
usage
was
to state the
case to the generally.
emperor in writing , and take his opinion
upon it.
This
was certainly
a bad method of interpretation .
To inter-
rogate the legislature
to decide
particular
disputes , is not
only endless , but
affords
great
room
for partiality and
oppression .
The answers of the emperor were called his
rescripts , and these had in succeeding
cases
the force of
perpetual
laws ; though they ought to be carefully distin-
guished , by
every
rational
civilian , from
those general
constitutions
which
had
only
the nature
of things
for
their
guide .
The
emperor
Macrinus ,
as
his
historian
Capitolinus
informs us, had once resolved to abolish these
rescripts , and retain only the general edicts : he could not
bear that the hasty and crude answers of such princes as
Commodus
and Caracalla
should be reverenced
as laws .
But Justinian thought otherwise (x), and he has preserved
them all.
In like manner
the
canon laws ,
or decretal
epistles
of the
popes , are all of them rescripts in the
strictest
sense .
Contrary
to all true forms of reasoning ,
they argue from particulars
to generals .

THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
Rules of
legislative
policy.
Statute to
be
tive.
In construing statutes , certain rules of legislative
policy ,
as well as the recognised
canons of interpretation , should .
be kept in view .
I.
Rules of legislative
policy
widely
applicable , are as
under :-
1. Parliament
will be presumed
to legislate
prospec-
asprospectively , not retrospectively
; and statutes
are , therefore , to
be
construed
as
prospective
unless
they
are
expressly
made applicable
to transactions
past
or pending .
This
rule is " one of such obvious convenience and justice " that
it must
be adhered to, " unless in
cases
where there is
something on the face of the enactment putting it beyond
doubt that the legislature
meant it to operate
retrospec-
tively " (y).
Common
law gives
placeto a
statute, and
tute to a
new one.
2. Where the common law and a statute
differ , the
common law gives place to the statute ; and an old statute
an
old
sta-
gives
place
to
a
new one
(
~).
And this upon
a
general
principle
of
universal law
,
leges posteriores priores
con-
trarias abrogant
:
consonant
to
which
,
it
was laid down by
a
law
of
the twelve tables
at
Rome
,
quod populus
postre-
mum jussit
,
id
jus ratum
esto
.
But this
is
to be under-
stood only when the latter statute
is
couched
in
negative
terms
,
or
where its matter
is
so
clearly repugnant
,
that
it
necessarily implies
a
negative
.
As
,
if
a
former
act says
,
that
a
juror upon such
a
trial shall
have twenty pounds
a
year
;
and
a
new statute afterwards
enacts
,
that
he shall
have twenty
marks
:
here
the
latter
statute
,
though
it
does
not
express
,
yet necessarily implies
a
negative
,

For

But
if

here the
jurisdiction
of
the
sessions
is
not
taken
away
,
but
both
have concurrent
jurisdiction
,
and the offender may
be
prosecuted
at
either
:
unless the new statute subjoins
express
negative
words
,
as,
that the
offence
shall

mon prosecutions
for high treason ; but will not restrain
or
clog
any
parliamentary
attainder (g) .
Because the
legislature , being in truth the sovereign power , is always
of equal , always of absolute , authority : it acknowledges no
superior upon earth , which the prior legislature must have
been , if its ordinances could bind a subsequent parliament .
And
upon
the
same
principle
Cicero , in his
letters to
Atticus , treats with a proper
contempt
these
restraining
clauses , which
endeavoured to tie up the hands of suc-
ceeding legislatures . " When you repeal the law itself,"
says he, " you
at the
same time
repeal the prohibitory
clause, which guards against such repeal " (h) .

there arise out

a

as to

such
collateral
consequence
. I lay
down the rule with these
restrictions
; though it is some-
times laid down
more largely,
that
acts of parliament
contrary to reason
are void (¿).
But if the parliament
will positively
enact a thing to be done which
is unrea-
sonable , I know of no power in the ordinary forms of the
constitution
vested with authority to control it : and the
examples usually alleged in support of this sense of the

Such
was
the
language
of
Lord C. J. Hobart in Dayv. Savadge,
Hob. 87.
Lord Coke , in Bonham's
case, 8 Rep . 115, 118 a,
lays
down
the principle
in more guarded terms
thus
" If an
act of parliament
be against common right and reason,
or
repugnant
or impossible
to be
performed , the
common
law will
:-
control
it
and
adjudge
it
to
be
void ."
To this doctrine Lord C. J.
Holt
assented , in The City of Lon-
don v. Wood , 12 Mod . 687 ; and it
was said in 10 Mod . 115, that "an
act of
parliament
against
natural
equity
must
be void from
its first
creation ,
for jura
naturæ
sunt
immutabilia,
et leges legum .
But
this
must be a very clear case, and
judges will strain
hard
rather
than
interpret
an act of parliament , void
ab initio."

LAW.

rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of
a statute is unreasonable ,
the judges
are
at liberty to
reject it ; for that were to set the judicial power above the
legislative , which would
be subversive of all government .
But where
general words , if applied
to a particular
state
of facts , would lead to an unreasonable consequence
, there
the judges
are
in decency to conclude that this conse-
quence
was not intended
or foreseen by parliament , and
they will strive to expound the statute so as to avoid it.
Thus , if an act of parliament
gives a man
power
to try
all causes that arise within his manor of Dale ; yet if a
cause
should arise in which he himself is party , the act is
construed not to extend to that , because it is unreasonable
that any man should determine his own quarrel (k).
But ,
if we could
conceive it possible for parliament
to enact
that he should try as well his own causes
as those of other
persons , there is no
court that
has power to defeat the
intent of the legislature
, when
couched in such
evident
and express words
as
leave no doubt whether it was the
intent of the legislature
or no.

Again ; terms of art , or technical

So in the
act of

the princess
Sophia ,
and
the
heirs of her body ,
being
protestants ," it becomes
necessary to call in the assistance
of lawyers , to ascertain
the
precise
idea of the words ,
" heirs of her body ,"
which in a legal
sense
comprise
certain only of her lineal descendants .
The construing of a statute doubtless may , by the fore-
going
canon of interpretation
and by the rules
which
follow , be facilitated .
A capacity , however , for rightly
apprehending the meaning of the legislature
where their
language is ambiguous or perplexed , can but
be
acquired
gradually
by practical experience and by a careful study of
decided cases . Should the intention of the lawgiver primâ

more
recondite
maxims of construction until the primary
maxim
has been
applied and been found to fail. It was long since resolved (0)
-that judges ought not to make any construction
against
the express
letter of a statute ; for nothing
can so exhibit
the meaning of the makers of an act
as their own direct
words-index animi sermo . " And it would be dangerous
to give scope
to make
a construction
in any case against
the express words when the meaning of the makers doth
not appear to the contrary , and when no inconvenience will
thereupon follow :

Thus the preamble is often called in to help the construc-

Of the same nature and use is the comparison of a law
with other laws made by the
same
legislator , which have
some affinity with the subject, or which expressly relate to

says
Lord
Bacon ,
"though the intent

derived
from
them ; for the

frequently

In R. v.

And
whether the words shall be restrained

sition

because
the
statute
which
affixes a punishment
to the
crime of murder abstains from defining it.

effects
and
consequence
which will
ensue
if a
a particular particular
meaning
be put upon statutory words , may be
tion maybe regarded ;
so that where words literally understood bear
either a very absurd signification
, or none at all , we may
a little deviate from the received sense of them , if by so
doing effect can be given to the apparent or presumable
intention
of the legislature .
Therefore the Bolognian
law,
mentioned by Puffendorf (u) , which
enacted , " that who-
ever drew blood in the streets
should be punished with the
utmost
severity ,"
was held
after a long
debate
not to
extend to the surgeon who
opened
the vein of a person
who fell down in the street in a fit.
A saving re-
pugnant to
an act is
void.

:-
The rule under our notice
has
been
thus
stated (x) : —
" Words which
are plain enough in their
ordinary
sense
may ,
when they would
involve
any
absurdity
or incon-
sistency ,
or
repugnance
to
the
clear
intention
of the
legislature , to be collected from the whole of the act or
acts
in pari materia
to be construed with it , or
other
legitimate
grounds of interpretation
, be modified or altered
so
as to
avoid
that
absurdity , inconvenience , or repug-
nance, but no further , for then we may predicate that the
words never could have been used by the framers of the
law in such a sense ."
5. A saving , totally repugnant to the body of the act, is
the
body
of
void
.
If
therefore an act
of
parliament
vests land

the
king and his heirs
,
saving the right
of
all persons whatso-

Thus , when a

purchase " provisions " at Rome , it might seem to pro-
hibit the buying of grain
and other victuals
there ; but
when we
consider that

THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
The "equi-
ty of a
statute."
In remedial
statutesthe
which
moved the legislature
to enact it.
For when this
reason ceases , the law itself ought likewise
to cease with it.
An instance of this
is given in a case put by Cicero (c).
There was a law , that those who in a storm
forsook the
ship , should
forfeit
all
property
therein ;
and that the
ship and lading should belong entirely to those who staid
in it.
In a dangerous tempest all the mariners
forsook
the ship , except
only one sick
passenger, who by reason
of his
disease
was unable to get
out and
escape .
By
chance the ship
came
safe to port .
The sick
man kept
possession, and claimed the benefit of the law .
Now here
all the learned agree , that
the sick man is not within the
reason of the law ; for the
reason of making it was, to
give encouragement to such as should
venture their lives
to
save
the
vessel : but this is a merit
which
he
could
never pretend to, who
neither
staid in the ship upon that
account , nor contributed anything
to its preservation .
From this method of interpreting
laws , by the reason of
them , arises what we call the equity of a statute ;
equity
being generally defined by Grotius (d) —" the correction of
that ,
wherein
the law (by reason of its universality )
is
deficient ."
In
accordance
, however , with remarks
before
made (e), recourse must
not be had to this
method of
construction
unless where effect can thus only be given to
the intent of the enactment (ƒ) .
9.
There are three points to be considered in the con-
mischief is
struction
of
all

statutes ;
the
old law, the

(f) " It is, in
my
opinion ,
so
important for the court , in constru-
ing
modern
statutes , to
act upon
the principle
of giving full effect to
their language , and of declining
to
mould
that
language
in order
to
meet either an alleged
convenience
or an alleged equity , upon
doubtful
evidence of intention , that
nothing
will induce me to withdraw a case
from
the
operation
of
a
section
which is within its words , but clear
and
unambiguous
evidence that so
to do is to fulfil
the general intent
of the statute ; and also that to ad-
here to the literal interpretation
, is
to decide
inconsistently
with other
and

act ; what
the mischief was

for which the common law did
not provide
;
and what vanced

has provided
to

.
And
it
is
the business
of
the judges
so
to
construe the act
as
to
suppress the mischief

advance

(g
).
To exemplify this by reference
to
the restraining

,
13
Eliz
.
c.
10
,
by the common law
,
ecclesiastical
corpora-
tions might let
on
as
long leases
as
they thought
proper
:
the mischief was
,
that they let
on long and unreasonable
leases
,
to
the
impoverishment
of
their successors
:
the
remedy
applied by the statute was by making
void all
leases by ecclesiastical
bodies for longer terms than three
lives
or
twenty
-
one
years
.
Now
in
the
construction
of
this
statute
it
is
held
,
that leases
,
though
for
a
longer
term
,
if
made by
a
bishop
,
are
not
void
during
the
bishop's
continuance
in

;
or
,
if
made by
a
dean
and chapter
,
they are
not void during
the continuance
of
the dean
for the act was made for the benefit and pro-
tection of the successor
().
The
mischief
is
therefore
sufficiently
suppressed
by vacating
these
leases
after the
determination
of
the
interest
of
the grantors
;
but the
leases
,
during
their
continuance
,
being not
within the
mischief
,
are not within the remedy
.

Penal
statutes must be construed strictly (i) ; this
rule being founded
on the
tenderness
of the law for the
rights
of individuals
(k) , and
its regard for the personal
liberty of the subject (7) .

Statutes

:
frauds
are
to be liberally
and
frauds
are
beneficially
expounded
.
This may seem
in
contradiction
to
the last rule
;
most statutes
against
frauds
being
in
their consequences
penal
.
But
a
distinction
is
here
to
be
taken
where
the
statute
acts
upon
the
offender
,
and
inflicts
a
penalty
,
as
a
fine
,
it
is
then
to
be taken strictly
:
but when the
statute
acts
upon the
offence
,
by setting
aside the fraudulent
transaction
,
here
it
is
to
be con-
strued liberally
.

centuries
from the time
of the hostile
invasions of the
Saxons , when
the
ancient
and
Christian
inhabitants
of
the
island
retired
to
those
natural
intrenchments , for
protection
from
their
pagan
visitants .
But when these
invaders
themselves
were converted to Christianity
, and
settled
into regular
and potent governments , this retreat
of the
ancient
Britons
grew every day narrower ;
they
were
overrun
by little
and little , gradually
driven from
one fastness to another , and by repeated
losses
abridged
of their wild independence .
Very early in our
history
we find their princes doing
homage to the crown of Eng-
land ; till at length in the reign of Edward
I. , who
may
justly be styled the conqueror of Wales , the line of their
ancient princes was abolished , and the king of England's

eldest son became
by creation their titular prince ; the ter-
ritory of Wales
being then entirely
re -annexed (by a kind
of feudal
resumption ) to the dominion of the
crown of
England (a) ; or as the statutum
Wallic ( 12 Edw.
1 ) ex-
presses it, " terram Wallia cum incolis suis, prius nobis jure
feodali subjectam jam sui gratiâ in proprietatis
nostræ domi-
nium obstaculis quibuscunque
cessantibus totaliter et cum inte-
gritate convertit,
et
coronæ
regni Angliæ
tanquam
partem

annexit
et univit ."
By this
statute of
Wales material
alterations
were made in divers parts of
the laws prevailing
there, so as to reduce them nearer to
the English
standard , especially in the forms of judicial
proceedings
but there was still retained very
much of
their original
polity ; particularly
the rule of inheritance ,
viz . , that lands
were divided
equally among all the issue
male ,
and did
not
descend to the eldest son alone (b) .
By other subsequent statutes the provincial
immunities of
the Welsh were still farther
abridged : but the finishing
stroke to their independence was given by the 27 Hen . 8 ,
c. 26 , which
at the same
time gave the utmost advance-
ment to their civil prosperity , by
admitting
them
to
a
thorough
communication
of laws
with
the
subjects
of
England.
Thus were this
brave
people gradually
con-
quered into the enjoyment of true
liberty
; being insen-
sibly
put upon the same
footing
as , and
made fellow-
citizens
with their
conquerors .

municating
jurisdictions, and
from
the acts of two dis-
tinct and independent
parliaments , which in many points
altered
and
abrogated
the
old
common law of both
kingdoms .
However , sir Edward
Coke , and the politicians
of that
time , conceived great difficulties
in carrying
out the pro-
jected
union
:
but these were afterwards
overcome
, and
the great work was
happily
effected
A.D.
1707
;
when
twenty -five articles of union were agreed to by the parlia-
ments of both nations ; the purport of the most consider-
able being as follows .
That-
1. On the first of May,
1707 , and for
ever
after , the
kingdoms of England and
Scotland
shall be united into
one kingdom , by the name of Great Britain .
2.
The
succession to the
monarchy of Great
Britain
shall be the same as was before
settled with regard
to
that of England.
3. The united kingdom
shall be represented by one par-
liament .
4. There
shall
be a communication
of all rights and
privileges
between the subjects of both kingdoms , except
where it is otherwise agreed .
9. When England raises
about
2,000,000l . by a land
tax , Scotland shall raise 48,000 .
16 , 17.
The
standards of the
coin , of weights , and of
measures , shall be reduced to those of England , through-
out the united kingdom .
18.
The laws relating
to trade , customs , and the excise ,
shall be the same in Scotland
as in England .
But all
the other laws of Scotland shall remain in force ; though
alterable by the parliament
of Great
Britain .
Yet with
this
caution
that
laws
relating
to
public
policy
are
alterable
at
the
discretion
of
the
parliament
;
laws
relating to private
right are not to be altered but for the
evident utility of the people of Scotland .
:
22.
Sixteen
peers
are
to be
chosen
to
represent the
peerage of
Scotland in
parliament , and members (the

number
whereof is now such as hereinafter
specified ) , to
sit in the house of commons .
23. The sixteen peers of Scotland shall have all privi-
leges of parliament
:
and all peers
of Scotland
shall
be
peers of Great
Britain , and rank next after those of the
same
degree
at the time
of the union , and shall have
all privileges
of
peers
;
except
sitting in the house of
lords , the privileges
depending
thereon , and particularly
the right of sitting
on the trial of a peer.

articles

time of the union ,

3. That therefore any alteration in the constitu-
tion of either of those churches , or in the liturgy of the
church of England (unless with the consent of the respec-
tive churches , collectively or representatively given ) , would
be an infringement
of these " fundamental
and essential
conditions ,"
and greatly
endanger
the union .
4. That
the
municipal
laws of Scotland
are
ordained
to be still
observed in that
part of the island , unless altered by the
imperial legislature
( ) , and although
parliament
has in
many particulars
thought
fit
to
legislate
for Scotland
,
her
municipal

respects continue

whereas the common laws

subjection

it

to
be for
ever
united to the crown and realm of England) was confirmed
by King Edward III. with some additions
; particularly
,
that it should be governed by the laws
and usages which
it enjoyed during the time of king
Alexander , that is,
before its reduction
by Edward I.
Its
constitution
was
new-modelled ,
and put upon
an English
footing
by a
charter of king James I.: and all its liberties , franchises ,
and customs , were confirmed in parliament by the statutes
22 Ed. 4, c. 8, and 2 Jac.

This town , indeed ,
derived
some local
peculiarities
from the ancient laws of
Scotland (j) , yet is clearly part of the realm of England ,
is represented by burgesses in the house of commons ,
and bound by all acts of the British parliament , whether
specially
named or otherwise .
And it was (perhaps super-
fluously ) declared and enacted
by statute 20 Geo . 2 , c. 42,
s . 3 , that where England only has been or shall be men-
tioned in any act of parliament , the same notwithstanding
has been and shall be deemed
and taken to comprehend
and include the dominion of Wales and town of Berwick-
upon -Tweed.
Moreover the writs or processes
of the courts of West-

run into
Berwick ,

into the
principality of
Wales,
and it has been solemnly
adjudged (k)
that all
prerogative
writs (as those of mandamus

and that indictments
and other local
matters
arising in

many of the Irish were averse to
conform , and still
stuck
to their
Brehon law :
so that
both Henry III . (x) and Edward

to
renew
the
injunction
;
and
at
length
in a parliament

of Clarence , the

law was formally
abolished , it being unanimously
declared
to be indeed no law, but a lewd custom crept in of later
times .
And yet , even in the
reign of queen
Elizabeth ,
the wild natives still kept and preserved their Brehon law :
which
is described (2 ) to have been " a rule of right un-

from
one to another ,
in which oftentimes
there appeared great show of equity
in determining
the right between party and party , but in
many things repugnant

and

as the

And this is in accordance with
an
established maxim , that the general run of laws , enacted
by a superior
state ,
are
supposed to be calculated for
its
own internal
government
,
and do not extend
to
its
distant
dependencies
;
which
,
bearing
no part
in
the
legislature
,
are not therefore
in
its ordinary and daily contemplation
.
But
,
when the sovereign legislative
power
sees necessary
to
extend its care
to
any
of
its
subordinate
dominions
,
and mentions
them
expressly by name
,
or
includes
them
under general words
,
there can be no doubt but then they
are bound by its laws

The original
method
of
passing statutes
in
Ireland was
nearly the same
as
in
England
,
the chief governor holding
parliaments
at
his pleasure
,
which enacted
such laws
as
they
thought
proper

But

made
of
this liberty

and therein the said acts so certified , and no other , should be
proposed , received
, or rejected (ƒ) .
But as this precluded
any law from being
proposed , but
such as was precon-
ceived
before the
parliament
was in being , which occa-
sioned many inconveniences
and made frequent
dissolu-
tions
necessary, it was provided by the statute of Philip
and
Mary
before
cited
(g) , that
any new
propositions
might be certified
to England in the
usual
forms ,
even
after the summons
and during the session
of parliament .
By this
means , however , there was nothing
left to the
parliament
in Ireland , but
a bare negative
or power of
rejecting , not of proposing or altering any law .
The usage,
however , afterwards
was that bills might be framed in
either house , under the denomination
of " heads
for a bill
or bills : " and in that shape offered
to the consideration
of the lord lieutenant
and privy council : who upon
such
parliamentary
intimation , or otherwise
upon the
applica-
tion of private
persons
,
received and
transmitted
such
heads ,
or
rejected
them
without
any
transmission , to
England .
And with
regard
to
Poynings' law in par-
ticular , it could
not
have
been
repealed
or suspended ,
unless the bill for that purpose , before being
certified to
England , had been approved by both the houses (h) .
But the
Irish
nation , being
excluded from the benefit
of the English statutes , were deprived of many good and
profitable
laws , made for the improvement of the common
law
and , the measure of justice in both kingdoms
be-
coming thence no longer uniform , it was therefore enacted
by another of Poynings
' laws (i) , that all
acts of parlia-
ment , before made in England , should
be of force within
the realm of Ireland
(k ).
But , by the same
rule ,
that
laws
made in England ,
between king John's time and
Poynings ' law were not , with some peculiar exceptions ( 1) ,

parliament
made
since the
10 Hen .
7 now
bind the
people of
Ireland ,
unless
specially
named
or
included
under general
words (m).
And on the other hand it is
equally
clear , that where Ireland
is particularly
named ,
or is included
under
general
words , it is bound by such
acts of parliament .
For this follows from the very nature
and constitution
of a dependent state : dependence being
very little else , but an obligation
to conform to the will or
law of that
superior
person
or
state,
upon
which
the
inferior
depends.
The
original and true ground of this
superiority , in the
present
case , is what we usually
call ,
though
somewhat
improperly , the right of conquest :
a
right
allowed
by the law of nations , if not by that of
nature
but
which
in
reason
and civil policy , can mean
nothing
more , than
that , in order to put an end to hos-
tilities , a compact is either
expressly or tacitly
made be-
tween the conqueror and the
conquered , that if they will
acknowledge the victor for their master , he will treat them
for the future as subjects , and not as enemies (n).
But this
state of dependence being
almost
forgotten ,
and ready to be disputed
by the Irish
nation , it became
necessary some
years
ago to declare
how
that
matter
really
stood
and therefore by stat. 6 Geo .
1 ,
c.
5 , it is
declared , that the kingdom
of Ireland is and ought to be
ment , in Lord
Maguire's
Case, 4
St. Tr. 653, has enumerated
several
English
statutes
from the time
of
king John , by which
Ireland
was
bound .
In
that
case Lord Connor
Maguire , baron of Inneskillin , who
had
been
the
principal
contriver
and instigator
of the Irish rebellion
and
massacre
in
the
time
Charles
I. ,
had
been
brought
to
England
to be
tried in the
King's
Bench
at Westminster
, by a Middle-
sex
jury ,
and
the
question
was
of
whether
the prisoner
was
ousted of
his trial by his peers in Ireland by
force of the statute 35 Hen. 8, c. 2.
The
court
overruled
the prisoner's
plea , which decision was
approved
of by a resolution of the two houses
of Parliament
.
Lord Maguire
was,
therefore ,
found
guilty,
and
exe-
cuted as a traitor.

subordinate
to , and dependent upon , the imperial
crown
of Great
Britain ,
as being
inseparably
united
thereto ;
and that the king's
majesty , with the consent of the lords
and commons of Great
Britain in parliament ,
has
power
to make laws to bind the people of Ireland .
By two
statutes , the
39
& 40 Geo . 3 , c. 67, and the
Irish Act , 40 Geo . 3 , c. 38 , the legislative
union of Eng-
land and
Ireland
was
effected , the fundamental
articles
upon which it is based being as under :-
1.
That the kingdoms
of Great
Britain
and
Ireland
shall on the first day of January , 1801 , and for ever after ,
be united
into one kingdom , by the name of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .
2. That the
succession to the imperial
crown of the
United Kingdom shall continue limited
and settled in the
same manner
as
the
succession to the
crown
of Great
Britain and Ireland
stood before limited .
3. That the said United
Kingdom shall
be represented
in one and the same parliament , to be styled , " The Par-
liament
of the
United Kingdom
of Great
Britain
and
Ireland."
4. That
four
lords spiritual
of Ireland , by rotation of
sessions , and
twenty -eight
lords
temporal
of Ireland ,
elected for life by the peers of Ireland , shall
sit in the
House
of Lords ;
and
certain
commoners
(the
number
of whom is now such
as
hereinafter
specified)
shall
sit
and
vote in the
House
of
Commons
on
the part of
Ireland .
5. That the churches of England and Ireland
be united
into
one protestant
episcopal church , to be called , " the
United
Church
of England and Ireland ," that
the doc-
trine , worship , discipline , and government of this united
church
shall
be and
remain
the same as already
esta-
blished in England ; that the continuance
and preserva-
tion of the united
church
so established shall
be deemed
an essential and fundamental part of the union ; and that
in like manner the church of Scotland
shall remain

same as
established by law, and by the acts of union of
England and Scotland .
6. That the subjects of Great Britain and Ireland
shall
be entitled to the same rights
and privileges in trade and
navigation ,
and
also
all
treaties
with
foreign
powers.
That all
prohibitions
and bounties
upon the importation
of
merchandize
from one
country
to the
other
shall
cease : but that the importation
of certain articles therein
enumerated
shall
be
subject
to
the
duties
specified in
the act.
7. That the
sinking
funds ,
and
the
interest
of the
national
debt of each
country
shall
be defrayed by each
separately ;
and
that
Great
Britain
and
Ireland shall
contribute
according
to a certain
proportion
towards
the
public expenditure , subject to future regulation .
8. That all the laws and courts of each kingdom
shall
remain
as by law then established , subject
to alterations
by the united parliament
; but that all writs of error and
appeals shall
be
decided
by the
House of Lords of the
United Kingdom , except appeals from the Court of Admi-
ralty in Ireland ; and that all existing
laws
contrary to
these articles be repealed .
Thus
was
the
union
between
England
and
Ireland
effected , a union which may be pronounced indispensable
to the well-being of these adjacent
islands , and
which ,
though
sometimes jeopardized
by rebellion , has hitherto
endured .
With regard to
some
other adjacent islands which are
Portland ,
subject to the crown of Great Britain , little need
be said ;
the Isles of Portland and of Thanet are comprised respec-
tively within the neighbouring
counties of Dorset
and of
Kent , whilst the Isle of Wight
is (except for purposes
of parliamentary representation ( o) ) a portion of the county
of Hants , all
such
are to be looked
upon
as
annexed
to the
mother
island ,
and
as
part of the kingdom of

ISLE
OF MAN .

England (p).
But there are others which require a more
particular
consideration .
:
And , first, the Isle of Man is a distinct
territory
from Isle of Man.
England , and is not governed by our laws : neither
does
any act of parliament
extend to it, unless it be particu-
larly
named therein ; and then
an act of parliament
is
binding
there (q).
It was formerly
a subordinate
feud-
atory kingdom , subject to the
kings of Norway ; then to
king John and Henry III. of England ; afterwards
to the
kings of Scotland
; and then again to the crown of Eng-
land
and at length we find king Henry IV. claiming
the
island by right of conquest, and disposing of it to the earl
of Northumberland
; upon whose attainder it was granted
(by the name of the lordship
of Man ) to Sir John de
Stanley
by letters
patent
7
Hen . 4 ( ).
In his lineal
descendants it continued
for
eight
generations , till the
death of Fernando
earl of Derby , A.D.
1594
: when a con-
troversy
arose concerning the inheritance
thereof , between
his
daughters
and William
his
surviving
brother ; upon
which ,
and
a
doubt
that
was
started
concerning
the
validity of the original patent (s) , the island was seized into
the
queen's
hands , and afterwards
various
grants
were
made of it by king James I.: all which
being
expired
or
surrendered , it was
granted
afresh in
7 Jac.
1 to
William earl of Derby , and the heirs
male of his body ,
with remainder to his heirs general ; which grant was the
next year confirmed by act of parliament , with a restraint
of the power of alienation by the said earl and his issue
male .
On the death of James
earl of Derby , a.d.
1735 ,
the male line of earl William failing , the duke of Atholl
succeeded
to the island as heir general by a female branch .
In the mean time , though the title of king had long been
disused , the earls of Derby , as lords of Man , had maintained.
a sort of royal authority
therein ; by assenting to

The separate existence , however ,
of this
little
subordinate
royalty
having
been
found
inconvenient
for the
purposes
of public
justice , and for
the revenue (the island of Man affording
a commodious

was given to the treasury by statute 12
Geo.
1 , c . 28 , to
purchase the interest of its then proprietors
for the use of
the
crown
which
purchase was
at length completed in
the year 1765 , and
confirmed by statutes 5 Geo. 3, c. 26
and c. 39 (u) , whereby the whole island and all its depen-
dencies
so
granted
as
aforesaid (x)
became
inalienably
vested in the crown (y).
The channel islands-Jersey, Guernsey , Sark , Alderney ,
and their appendages -having
been parcel of the duchy of
Normandy , were united to the crown of England by the
first princes of the Norman line.
They are governed
by
their
own laws , which
are for the
most part the ducal
customs of Normandy ,
collected in
an ancient
book of
very great
authority , entitled
le grand coustumier .

are not bound by acts of our parliaments , unless
particu-
larly
named (z).
All
causes
are originally determined
by
their
own
officers, the bailiffs
and

islands ; but an appeal lies from them to the king and

resort (a) .

THE COLONIES .
119
Possessions.
The claim to our distant colonies and territorial
depen- Colonial
dencies is by right of occupancy , (where , for instance , an
island found
desert and uncultivated
has been
occupied
and
peopled by the mother -country , ) of conquest , or of
cession (c) ; such right being
founded
upon the law of
nature
or of nations .
But there is a difference
between
colonies , as regards the laws by which they are
or were
originally bound , resulting
from
the mode in which they
were acquired (d) .
Generally
speaking , if an
uninhabited
country be dis-
covered
and
occupied by English
subjects, all English
laws
then in being , which are the
birthright of every
subject ,
are immediately
there in force (e).
But this
must
be understood
with
many
and great
restrictions .
Such
colonists
carry
with
them
only
so
much
of the
English law, as is applicable to their
own situation
and
the
condition
of an infant colony ; such, for
instance , as
the general
rules of inheritance , and of protection
from
personal
injuries .
The
artificial
refinements
and
dis-
tinctions incident
to the property of a great
and
com-
mercial
people, the laws of mortmain (f), the laws of
police
and revenue ( such
especially
as
are enforced by
penalties ) , the mode of maintenance
for the clergy , the
jurisdiction of spiritual
courts , and a multitude
of other
provisions , are
neither
necessary nor convenient for the
newly -settled region , and consequently
are not there in
force .
What shall be deemed
to have been
admitted in
virtue of the general
rule ,
and what
rejected, at what
times , and under what
restrictions , has usually , in case
of dispute , been
decided in the first
instance by the pro-
vincial judicature
when
established ,
subject
to revision
and
control
by the sovereign in council
: the entire con-
stitution of the dependent territory
being
also liable

be new-modelled
and
reformed by the general
superin-
tending
power of the legislature
in the mother -country .
The laws , accordingly ,
which
govern
colonies
thus
ac-
quired , are , in the earlier
stages of their existence , partly
local
and partly those of England , whether
such as sub-
sisted at the date of their occupation , or such
as
have
subsequently
been made applicable to them .
And during
the last
few years , statutes
regulating
the constitutions ,
laws , and territorial limits of our principal
dependencies
(including Australia (g) , which
was
acquired by occu-
pancy for the purpose of a penal
settlement ( ) ) , have
been enacted
by the imperial
parliament .
In a conquered or ceded
country , which
prior
to con-
quest or cession had already laws of its own , the sovereign
may alter and change those laws ; but till he does actually
change them , the ancient laws of the country remain
in
force ( ) , for the laws of England, existing
at the
time
of cession or conquest , do not
become
applicable to the
new
dependency
(k) .
Should
the
sovereign ,
however ,
delegate to a local
legislature , erected
in the conquered
country , the power which
he thus
possessed
of altering
its laws , he will be precluded
from
afterwards
exercising
that
power
as
he
might
otherwise
have
done
(1), the
paramount
right
of
legislation
vested in
parliament
remaining of course
unaffected .

provinces
were obtained in the seven-

common law of England, as
such, had no allowance
or
authority there ; they being no part of the mother country ,
but distinct, though
dependent ,
dominions .
They
were
subject to the control of parliament
; albeit
not bound by
any acts of parliament , unless particularly
named therein .
It had indeed been declared by statute 7 & 8 Will. 3 , c. 22,
s. 9 (m) , that all laws , bye-laws , usages , or customs , which
shall be in practice in any of the plantations , repugnant
to any law hereafter to be made in this kingdom
relative
to the
said plantation ,
shall
be illegal, null
and void .
And , because
several of the
colonies had claimed
a sole
and exclusive right of imposing
taxes
upon themselves ,
the statute 6 Geo . 3 , c. 12 , expressly declared that all his
majesty's
colonies and plantations
in America
had been ,
were, and of right ought to be subordinate to and depen-
dent upon
the
imperial
crown
and parliament
of Great
Britain ; who had full power and authority to make laws
and statutes of sufficient
force and validity to bind the
colonies
and people of America , subjects of the crown of
Great Britain , in all cases whatsoever .
And this authority
was
afterwards
forcibly exemplified , and carried out , by
the statute
7 Geo. 3 , c. 59 , for suspending
the legislation
of New York ; and has
been
exercised on more recent
occasions .
The statutes specified gave rise , as is well known , to the
first American
war .
The
celebrated Declaratory Act ( n) ,
in which
the parliament
of the mother
country
declared
that they would not impose internal
taxes for the purposes
of revenue , having come too
late to appease
or retain the
colonies ,
who were
eventually , by the
treaty of Paris ,
(A.D.
1783 ,)
acknowledged
to be " free,
sovereign , and
independent " (0).

ENGLAND .
Classifica-
tion of
Colonies.
The
policy
now
generally
adopted
by the
mother
country in regard
to
our
colonies is of this kind-to
abstain
from legislation
concerning
matters
of purely
internal
interest (p).
Our
colonial
dependencies ,
regard
being
had to the
mode in which they were originally acquired and governed ,
have been variously
classified ; for our
present purpose
they may be divided into three sorts :-I. Colonies which ,
in the first stages of their existence , were under the direct
authority of the crown
and parliament
; II. Proprietary
Governments
; and , III.
Charter
Governments
; to the
first-mentioned
of
which
our
remarks
will
principally
refer .
I.
Colonies
included
in the first
of the
above
classes
may , in accordance
with what
has been already
said , be
arranged
under
two heads :
1. those which , having
been
originally acquired
by conquest
or
cession , retain
their
own laws , except as altered by the crown ; 2. those which ,
having
been originally acquired by occupancy , are subject
to the laws of England in force at the time of occupancy ,
except as altered by subsequent legislation .
Of the above-mentioned two classes , the former may be
again subdivided
so as to include , ( 1. ) colonies which have
received constitutions
from the crown , whereby the royal
prerogative
of legislation
has
been
abandoned to repre-
sentative
assemblies ; and
(2. ) colonies which
have not
received
such
constitutions .
Almost
all
our
colonial
possessions are now included
in the former
subdivision ,
and enjoy
constitutions
more
or
less
modelled
on
our
own (9) .
The legislative
power is in these dependencies
vested in a governor , representing the sovereign , commis-
sioned and instructed by the crown , a council corresponding
with the British
cabinet
and
house of peers , and
an
assembly
chosen by the
people corresponding
with our
house of commons ; these constituent departments , having

sub modo the same powers of legislation
as their
proto-
types in England, subject , however , to the final negative
of the
sovereign ,
and to the
supreme
control
of the
imperial
parliament .
The
executive
power
is
vested
in
the
governor ,
with
or
without
the
assent of the
council(r).
Some few colonies which
have received no constitution
creating
a local legislature , are still
subject to the legis-
lation of the king in council (s ).
These retain the laws
in force at the time of their cession to this country (t) ,
unless
where
modified
by the
imperial
government ,
or
perhaps when clearly repugnant to natural justice and the
spirit of our constitution (u).
Colonies
included in the second of the
above -named
classes , having
been acquired by discovery
or occupancy,
are governed by the general law of England , as it existed
when the colony was first
established , together with such
regulations
as have been since specially provided for them
by the British legislature

124
COUNTRIES
SUBJECT
TO
THE LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
II. Proprietary
governments
(~) , were granted
out by
the crown to individuals
, in the nature of feudatory prin-
cipalities , with all the inferior regalities , and subordinate
powers of
legislation , which
formerly belonged
to the
owners of counties
palatine : yet with these
express
con-
ditions , that the ends for which the grant was made
should
be
substantially
pursued ,
and
that
nothing
should
be
attempted which
might derogate from
the sovereignty of
the mother country .
III . A Charter
government (a) was in the nature of a
civil corporation , with the power of making
bye -laws for
its own interior regulation , not contrary to the laws of
England ; and with such rights
and authorities
as were
specially given in its charter of incorporation
( b) .
Our colonies having thus in various ways been acquired
by the mother country , and though
alike brought
under
her
control ,
having
been
originally governed
by laws
essentially
diverse ;
those laws ,
moreover ,
having
from
time to time
been changed or modified by the sovereign
in council , by the imperial
parliament , or by the local
legislatures , it may well be that
doubts
have
ere
now
arisen in regard to the existing
state of our colonial law,
(2) Such were Pennsylvania
, De-
laware , and
Maryland
; Barbadoes ,
which was
granted
to the Earl of
Carlisle , and St. Lucia to the
Duke
of Montague , might
formerly
have
been included
in this class.
In
1663 Canada , which
had till
that
period
been
a
proprietary
government , was
raised to the dig-
nity of a royal government ,
and
from
that time
its governors
were
appointed by a regular
commission
from the crown .
In 1759 it was
conquered
by
General
Wolfe ,
and
by the Treaty of Paris
1763 ceded
to his Britannic Majesty .

a
charter government
as one in which
the sovereign
has parted
with his
rights
wholly
or partially to the
colonist
; in which
both houses
are
elective , and sometimes the governor
also ;
in
short ,
as
a
democracy .

and in regard to the legality of the mode in which supreme
powers of law -making
have been
exercised.
To settle ,
and , so far as may be , allay such doubts , three important
statutes have
been passed during the present reign .
One
of these statutes
applies
to acts
done by the crown , pre-
sumably in virtue of its prerogative , the legality of which
may be questionable
; whilst the two other statutes apply
to acts of the colonial legislatures .
The statute 6 & 7 Vict. c. 94 , in its preamble sets forth
that, " by treaty ,
capitulation , grant ,
usage ,
sufferance
,
and
other lawful
means, her
Majesty
hath
power
and
jurisdiction within divers
countries
and places out of her
Majesty's
dominions ," and that " doubts have arisen how
far the exercise of such power
and jurisdiction
is con-
trolled by and dependent on the laws and customs of this
realm , and it is
expedient
that
such doubts
should
be
removed ,"
and
enacts
(s.
1) that , " it is
and
shall
be
lawful for her
Majesty
to hold , exercise , and enjoy any
power or jurisdiction which her Majesty now hath , or may
at any time
hereafter have within any country
or place
out of her Majesty's
dominions , in the same and as ample
a manner as if her
Majesty had
acquired
such power
or
jurisdiction by the cession or conquest of territory ," and
further (s . 2) that , " every act, matter , and thing which
may at any time be done in pursuance of any such power
or jurisdiction of her Majesty , in any country
or place out
of her
Majesty's
dominions , shall
in all
courts
ecclesi-
astical and temporal , and elsewhere within her Majesty's
dominions , be and
be deemed
and adjudged
to be in all
cases and to all intents
and purposes whatsoever , as valid
and effectual as though the same had been done according
to the local law then in force within
such
country
or
place ."
With regard to the acts of colonial legislatures , and the
validity of colonial laws :-:-
The statute 26 & 27 Vict . c. 84 , enacts (s . 2) as follows :
that, " All laws heretofore passed
or purporting
to have


126
COUNTRIES
SUBJECT
TO
THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
been passed by any colonial
legislature
with the object of
declaring
or altering
the constitution
of such legislature
or of any branch
thereof , or the
mode of appointing
or
electing
the members
of the
same ,
shall
have
and
be
deemed
to have had from the date at which the same shall
have received the assent of her Majesty , or of the governor
of the colony on behalf of her Majesty , the same force and
effect for all purposes whatever , as if the said legislature
had possessed
full powers of enacting laws for the objects
aforesaid , and
as if all formalities
and conditions
by act
of parliament
or otherwise
prescribed
in respect of the
passing of such laws had been duly observed ."
The 28 & 29 Vict .
c.
63 , entitled , " An Act to remove
doubts as to the validity of colonial laws ," applies
to all
her
Majesty's
possessions abroad in which
there
exists
a local
legislature
competent
to make
laws (except the
Channel
Islands , the Isle of Man , and territories
vested
in the crown by virtue of any act for the government of
India ).
This statute
enacts
as follows
:
(s. 2) That any
colonial
law in any respect repugnant
to the provisions of
any act of parliament
extending
to the
colony to which
such law may relate , or repugnant
to any order or regu-
lation made under
authority
of such act, or having in the
colony the force
and effect of
such act, shall
be read
subject to such act, order , or regulation , and shall to the
extent of such
repugnancy , but not
otherwise ,
be
and
remain
absolutely
void
and inoperative .
(s . 3) That
no
colonial
law shall
be or be deemed
to have been void or
inoperative
on the ground
of repugnancy
to the law of
England ,
unless
the
same shall
be
repugnant
to the
provisions of some such act of parliament , order , or regu-
lation
as aforesaid .
(s. 4) That no colonial law, passed
with the concurrence of or assented
to by the governor of
any colony or to be hereafter so passed or assented
to shall
be or be deemed
to have been void or inoperative by reason
only of any instructions
with reference to such law or the
subject thereof which may have been given to such governor

by or on behalf of her
Majesty by any instrument
other
than
the letters
patent
or instrument
authorizing
such
governor
to concur in passing or to assent to laws for the
peace, order , and good government of such colony ,
even
though such instructions
may be referred to in such letters
patent
or last
mentioned
instrument .
(s . 5) That every
colonial
legislature
shall
have
and
be
deemed
at
all
times
to have had full
power within its jurisdiction to
establish
courts of judicature , and to abolish
and recon-
stitute
the
same ,
and
to alter
the
constitution
thereof,
and to make
provision
for the
administration
of justice
therein ,
and
every
representative
legislature
shall
in
respect to the colony under
its
jurisdiction
have and
be
deemed
at
all times
to
have had full power
to
make laws
respecting
the constitution
,
powers
,
and procedure
of
such
legislature
;
provided that such laws shall have been
passed
in
such
manner

changes which
have
thus , during
rather more
than
two
and a half centuries , been
effected in our Eastern
Empire
may be more fitly discussed by the historian
than by the
legal commentator .
Of such changes the most important
were made by the following statutes (e) :-13 Geo. 3 , c. 63
(explained and amended by 21 Geo . 3, c. 70) , which first
made provision
for the government of British India by the
appointment
for that purpose of a governor -general
and
council ; the 24 Geo .
3, c. 25 , under which
the board of
control
was established ;
the 33
Geo.
3,
c.
52 , and 53
Geo.
3 ,
c. 155 ,
which
confirmed
and
continued
to the
East India Company for certain terms their
territory
and
revenues
together with commercial
privileges ; the 3 & 4
Will . 4 , c . 85 , which
further
continued
the territories
of
the
company
under their
government , with
all
their
powers ,
rights ,
and immunities
until
the
year
1854 ,
extinguished
the privilege
of trading
exclusively
in tea
which had previously
been
enjoyed by the company , re-
modelled
the
board of commissioners
for the
affairs of
India , vested in the court of directors the appointment of
the governor -general , subject
to the royal
approval , and
transferred
the
island
of
St.
Helena , which
had been
held by the East India Company , to the crown ; the 16 &
17 Vict . c. 95 , which (confirming
the provisions of former
acts not inconsistent
therewith ) further
continued to the
company the possession of their
territories
until parlia-
ment should otherwise provide , and which
likewise recon-
stituted the court of directors and the legislative
council ;
the
21 & 22 Vict . c. 106
(entitled " an act for the better
government of India ") enacting that all territories in the
possession,
or under the government of the
East India
Company , and all rights
vested
in
the said
company in
relation thereto should become vested in her Majesty , and
be
exercised in
her
name (ƒ) ;
that India should
be
governed by and in the
name of her
Majesty

secretary
of state (h); that
a council
should be estab-
lished consisting of fifteen members , styled the council of
India ( ) , in contradistinction
to the council of the gover-
nor-general in India .
By this statute also were regulated
the duties
and procedure of the council (k) , the mode of
making appointments
and bestowing
patronage (1) , the
transfer to her
Majesty of the property previously
vested
in the company (m), the
expenditure of the
revenues
of
India (n),
also the conditions of service of the military
and
naval
forces (o),
and
of
persons
holding
offices ,
employments , or commissions
under
the
company (p).
The statute further
enacted
that all treaties made by the
said
company should be binding
on her Majesty , and that
all contracts
and engagements of the company should
be
enforceable by or against
the secretary of state for India ,
as they might have been by or against the company (q) ;
and lastly the 24 & 25 Vict . c. 67 (the provisions of which
are amended and enlarged by the
28
& 29 Vict .
c. 17) ,
whereby
are regulated
the
composition of the council of
the governor -general , the mode in which business is to be
conducted , and laws (subject to disallowance
on the part
of the Crown )
are
to be made by it, the extent of the
power of the governor of a presidency to legislate , and the
power of the governor -general in council (subject likewise
to
disallowance
by the Crown ) to
alter the
territorial
boundaries of any presidency or province .
The result of legislation
in regard to India , therefore ,
is that the vast region
formerly
administered by or in the
name of the East India Company , is now brought directly
under
the government
of the Queen, such
government
being
conducted
through the secretary of state
and the
council
of India, the

to the judicial committee of the privy council .
With respect to foreign
possessions which
may become
which may vested in the sovereign , a remark
may not be inappro-
priate .
Before the kingdom of Hanover had been
severed
from the crown of Great
Britain , the English legislature
had
remarked
the
inconveniences
which
resulted
from
dominions
on the continent of Europe
being
annexed to
it ;
from the Norman
territory
which William
the Con-
queror
brought
with him , and held
in conjunction with
the English throne ; and from Anjou , and
its
appendages
,
which fell
to
Henry
II
.
by hereditary descent
.
They had
seen the
nation
engaged for
near
four
hundred
years
together
in
ruinous wars for defence
of
these foreign domi-
nions
;
till
,
happily for this country
,
they were lost under
the reign of
Henry VI
.,
Calais
only
excepted
,
which
remained
in
our possession until A.D.
1558.
The legisla-
ture observed that
,
from
that time
,
the maritime interests
of England had been better understood and more closely
pursued
:
that
,
in
consequence
of
this attention
,
the nation
,
as
soon
as
she had rested from her civil wars
,
began
to
flourish all
at
once
;
and became
much more considerable
in
Europe
than
when
her
princes
were
possessed
of
a
larger territory
,
and her councils were distracted by foreign
interests
.

Every diocese
is
divided
into
archdeaconries ;
each arch-
deaconry into rural deaneries , which
are the

the archdeacons ' and rural deans ' jurisdictions

and
every
such
deanery
is

into
parishes (a).
A parish
is that circuit of ground which is committed
to the charge of one parson , vicar , or minister
having
cure of
souls
therein .
How
ancient
the
division
of
parishes is, may at present be difficult to ascertain ; for it
seems to be agreed
on all hands , that in the early ages of
Christianity in this
island , parishes
were
unknown , or at
least a parish
signified
the same as a diocese
does now .
There was then
no
appropriation
of
ecclesiastical
dues
to any particular
church ; but
every man was at liberty
to contribute
his tithes to whatever priest
or church he
pleased, provided
only
that he did it to some ;
or if he
made
no
special appointment
or appropriation
thereof ,
tithes
were paid into the
hands
of the bishop , whose
duty it was to distribute
them
among
the clergy , and
for other pious
purposes , according
to his own discre-
tion (b).
Mr. Camden (c) says , England was divided into parishes
by archbishop
Honorius
about the year
636.
Sir Henry
Hobart (d) lays it down , that parishes were first
erected
by the council
of Lateran ,
which
was held
A.D.
1179 .
These speculations , widely differing
from each other , differ
perhaps
as widely from
the truth ; which
may be found
in the
medium
between
the
two
extremes.
For Mr.
Selden
has clearly
shown ( e), that the
clergy
lived
in
jutor of a bishop , appointed in case
of his bodily infirmity , is not to be
confounded with a suffragan .

common
without
any division
of parishes , long after the
time
mentioned
by Camden .
And it appears from
the
Saxon laws , that parishes were in being
long before the
date of that council of Lateran , to which they are ascribed
by Hobart.
We find the distinction of parishes , nay even of mother-
churches , so early as in the
laws of king Edgar, about
the year 970.
970.
Before that time the consecration of tithes
was in general arbitrary
; that
is , every man paid his own
(as was
before
observed )
to what
church
or
parish
he
pleased (ƒ) .
But this
being
liable
to be attended with
fraud,
or at least
caprice, in the
persons
paying
; and
with jealousies or mean compliances in such as were com-
petitors
for receiving
them ; it was ordered by a law of
king Edgar (g) that " every tithe
be rendered to the old
minister to which the district
belongs ; " and by a law of
king
Ethelred
( h) , it
was further
ordered
that " omnis
consuetudo
reddatur super amicitiam Dei ad matrem nostram
ecclesiam
cui adjacet ."
However , if any thane , or great lord ,
had a church within his own demesnes , distinct
from the
mother -church , in the nature of a private chapel ; then ,
provided such church had
a cemetery or consecrated
place
of burial belonging to it, he might allot one -third of his
tithes for the maintenance of the officiating
minister : but,
if it had no cemetery
, the thane must himself have main-
tained
his chaplain
by some
other means ; for in such
case all his tithes were ordained to be paid to the mother-
church (i).
This
proves that
the
kingdom
was
then
generally
divided into parishes ; which
division
happened probably
not all at once , but by
degrees .
For it seems
tolerably
certain , that the boundaries of parishes (k) were originally

ascertained by those of a manor or manors : since it very
seldom happens
that
a manor
extends itself over more
parishes than
one , though
there are often
many manors
in
one
parish .
The lords ,
as Christianity
spread
itself,
began to build churches upon their own demesnes
, or wastes ,
to accommodate
their
tenants
in
one
or
two
adjoining
lordships
and , in order to have divine
service regularly
performed therein , obliged all their tenants to appropriate
their
tithes
to the
maintenance
of the
one
officiating
minister , instead of leaving them at liberty
to distribute
the tithes
among
the clergy of the
diocese
in general
:
and this tract of land , the tithes whereof
were so appro-
priated , formed a distinct
parish .
Which will well enough
account for the frequent intermixture
of parishes one with
another .
For if a lord had a parcel of land detached
from
the main of his estate , but not sufficient to form a parish
of itself, it was natural for him to endow his newly erected
church with the tithes of those disjointed lands ; especially
if no church was then built in any lordship
adjoining
to
those outlying
parcels .
Thus
parishes
were
gradually
formed ,
and
parish
churches
endowed with the tithes
that
arose within the
circuits
assigned .
But some lands ,
either because they
were in the hands
of careless
owners , or were situate in
forests and desert places, or for other now
unsearchable
reasons , were
never united
to
any parish , and therefore
continue
to
this
day extra -parochial , unless
constituted
parishes by or in
virtue
of
an
act
of
parliament
( 1) ,
and their tithes
are now by immemorial
custom payable
to the king instead of the bishop , in trust and confidence
that he will distribute
them for the general
good of the
immemorial
custom ,

to

2. The civil division of the territory of England is into 2. Civil
counties , of those counties
into hundreds , of those hun-
dreds into tithings or towns .
Which
division , as it now
stands , has been , perhaps erroneously (0) , ascribed to king
Alfred : who , to prevent the rapines and disorders which
formerly prevailed in the realm , is said to have instituted
tithings ; so
called from the
Saxon ,
because
ten free-
holders
with their
families
composed
one.
These all
dwelt together , and were sureties
or free pledges
to the
king for the good behaviour of each other ; and, if any
offence was committed in their district, they were bound
to
have the offender forthcoming (p).
And
therefore
anciently
no man was suffered
to abide in England above
forty days , unless
he were enrolled in some tithing or
decennary (q).
One of the principal
inhabitants
of the
tithing was annually
appointed
to preside over the rest,
being called

Tithings , towns , or vills are of the same signification
in
law ; and are said to have had , each of them , originally a
church and celebration
of divine
service , sacraments , and
burials (s) : though that seems
to be rather an ecclesias-
tical than
a civil distinction .
The word " town " (†) or
" vill " is indeed , by the alteration of times and language ,
now become a generic
term , comprehending
under it the
several
species
of cities , boroughs , and
common
towns .

A borough
is now understood
to be a town , either corporate or not, sending burgesses
to
parliament (x).
Other towns there
are , computed by Sir
E. Coke (y) to number about 8,800 in his day , which
are
neither
cities nor boroughs
;
some of which
have the pri-
vilege of holding
markets , and others not ; though
both
are equally towns in law.
To several of these towns there
are small
appendages
belonging , called
hamlets ; which
are taken
notice of in the statute of Exeter (z) , which
makes
frequent
mention
of entire vills , demi -vills , and
hamlets .

tures
to have consisted of ten freemen or frank-pledges ,
demi -vills of five, and hamlets
of less
than
five .
These
little collections of houses are sometimes
under the same
administration
as the town itself, sometimes governed by
separate
officers ; in
which
last
case
they
are , to some
purposes in
law,
looked
upon
as
distinct

These towns , as was before hinted , contained each
origin-
ally but one parish ,

, are divided into
several

ing, so ten tithings composed
a superior
division , called
a hundred , as consisting
of ten times
ten families .
The
hundred
is governed by a high constable
or bailiff, and
formerly
there was regularly
held in it the hundred court
for the trial of
causes , though
now fallen into
disuse.
In some of the more northern counties these hundreds are
called wapentakes (b).
Territorial subdivisions , analogous to our hundreds , seem
to have
existed in Denmark (c) :
and
we find
that in
France
a regulation
of this
sort was made
about
two
hundred
years
before ;
set
on foot
by Clotharius
and
Childebert
, with a view of obliging each district to answer
for the robberies committed
in its own division .
These
divisions
were , in that
country , as well military as civil :
and each contained a hundred
freemen , who were subject
to an
officer called
the
centenarius ; a number of which
centenarii
were themselves
subject
to
a superior
officer
called the count or comes (d).
And indeed something like
this institution of hundreds may be traced back as far as
the ancient
Germans , from whom were derived both the
Franks who became
masters of Gaul , and the Saxons who
settled in England : for both the thing and the name , as

An indefinite
number
of these hundreds
make up a
county or shire .
Shire
is a Saxon
word
signifying
a
division
; but a county , comitatus , is plainly derived from
comes, the
count of the
Franks ;
that
is, the
earl, or
alderman (as the Saxons call him) of the shire , to whom
the
government
of it was
entrusted .
This he usually
exercised
by his
deputy , still
called
in Latin
vice-comes,
and in English , the sheriff, shrieve , or shire -reeve , signi-
fying the officer of the shire ; upon whom , by process of
time , the civil administration
of it is now totally devolved .
In some counties
there is an intermediate
division , be-
tween the shire and the hundreds , as lathes in Kent , and
rapes in Sussex, each of them
containing
about three or
four
hundreds
apiece .
These
had formerly
their lathe-
reeves
and rape-reeves , acting
in subordination
to the
shire -reeve .
Where
a county
is divided
into three of
these
intermediate
jurisdictions
,
they
are called
trith-
ings (f) ,
which
were anciently governed by a trithing-
reeve .
These trithings still subsist in the large county of
York, where by an easy corruption
they are denominated
ridings
; the
north , the
east , and the west-riding.
The
number
of counties
in
England
and Wales
has
been
different at different
times : at present there are forty in
England, and twelve in Wales .
Three of these counties , Chester , Durham , and Lancas-
ter , are
called
counties
palatine .

the franchise was greatly enlarged
and confirmed in par-

of Gaunt himself, whom , on
the death of his father-in-law, the king had also

duke of Lancaster (k).
Counties
palatine are so called a
palatio ; because
the owners thereof (the earl of Chester ,
the bishop
of Durham , and the duke of Lancaster , ) had
in those counties jura regalia , as fully as the king hath it
in his palace ;

expresses it (1) .
They might
pardon
treasons , murders ,
and
felonies ; they appointed
all judges
and justices of
the
peace (m ) ; all writs and
indictments
ran
in their
names , as in other counties in the king's ; and all offences
were
said to be done against
their
peace , and
not , as in
other places , contra pacem domini regis (n) .
And indeed.
by the ancient law, in all
peculiar jurisdictions
, offences
were said to be done against his peace in whose court they
were tried
in
a courtleet , contra pacem domini ; in the
court
of a
corporation , contra pacem ballicorum ; in the

authority , might
be the
more watchful
in its
defence
.
And upon this account also there were formerly
two other
counties palatine , Pembrokeshire
and Hexhamshire
; the
latter
now united with Northumberland
: but these were
abolished
by parliament , the former
in
27 Hen. 8 , the
latter in 14 Eliz .
And in 27 Hen . 8 , likewise , the powers
before
mentioned
of
owners
of
counties
palatine
were
abridged ; the
reason for their continuance in a manner
ceasing
though
still all writs
were witnessed
in their
names, and all forfeitures
for treason by the common law
accrued to them (q).
The earldom of Chester , as Camden testifies , was united
to the
crown by Henry III. , and has ever
since given a
title to the king's eldest son .
And the county palatine ,
or duchy , of Lancaster , was the property of Henry Boling-
broke , the
son of John
of Gaunt , at the time when
he
wrested
the crown
from king
Richard II. , and assumed
the title of king Henry IV.
But he was too prudent
to
suffer this to be united to the crown ; lest , if he lost one ,
he should
lose the other also .
For , as Plowden
(r) and
sir Edward
Coke (s) observe , he knew he had the duchy
of Lancaster by sure and indefeasible
title, but
that his
title to the
crown was not
so assured : for that after the
decease of Richard II. , the right of the crown was in the
heir of Lionel duke of Clarence , second son of Edward III.;
John of Gaunt , father to this Henry IV. , being
but the
fourth son.
And therefore he procured an act of parlia-
ment , in the first
year of his reign , ordaining
that
the
duchy of Lancaster , and all other his hereditary
estates ,
with all their royalties , and franchises , should
remain
to
him and his heirs for ever ; and should
remain , descend ,
be administered , and governed , in like manner
as if he
never had attained
the
regal
dignity
;
and
thus
they

Henry VI.
being
at-
tainted in 1 Edward
4 , this duchy was declared in parlia-

the same time an act was made to incorporate
the duchy
of Lancaster ,
to
continue
the
county
palatine

might

of England , for ever ; but
under a separate guiding
and
governance
from
the
other
inheritances
of the
crown .
And in 1 Hen. 7 another
act was made, to
resume such
part of the duchy lands as had been dismembered from it
in the reign of Edward IV. , and to vest the inheritance of
the whole in the king and his heirs for ever , as amply and
largely, and in like manner , form and condition , separate
from the crown of England and possession of the same, as
the
three
Henries
and Edward IV. , or any of them , had

(y) Some
have
entertained
an
opinion
(Plowd .

Archeion. 233 ; 4 Inst .
206), that
by this
act
the right of the duchy
vested only in the natural , and
not
in
the
political
person
of king
Henry VII., as formerly
in that of
Henry IV.; and was descendible
to
his
natural
heirs ,
independent
of
the succession
to the crown .
And
if this notion
were well founded , it
might have
become a very
curious
question
at the time of the Revolu-
tion in 1688 in whom
the right of
the
duchy
remained
after
king
James's
abdication ,
and
previous
to the
attainder
of the
pretended
Prince
of
Wales .
But it is
ob-
servable that in the same act the
duchy of Cornwall
is also vested in
king
Henry VII .
and
his
heirs ;
which could
never
be intended
in
any event to be separated from
the
inheritance
of the
crown .
And,
indeed ,
it
seems
to
have
been
understood
very
early
after
the
statute of Hen. VII . that the duchy
of
Lancaster
was
by
no
means
thereby made a separate inheritance
from
the
rest of the

separated

and
vested in the crown ; and by the 2

the 4 & 5 Will . 4 , c. 62 , the proceedings and practice of
the courts of Durham

assimilated

THE ABSOLUTE

THE laws of England are so numerous and diverse, that
in
order to consider them with perspicuity , they must
be distributed
by the
Commentator
methodically , under
proper and distinct heads ; avoiding
as much as possible
divisions
too large
and
comprehensive
on the one hand ,
and too trifling and minute
on the other ; which might be
equally productive of confusion .
Now, as municipal
law is " a

what is right, prohibiting
what is wrong ,
and regulating
matters

or
as

and
after him

and principal

the rights
that
are commanded , and
secondly the wrongs
that
are
forbidden
by the laws of
England.
Rights are however liable to another subdivision
; being

are annexed to the
persons of men , and are then
called jura personarum
or
the rights
of persons ;
or , secondly , such as
a man
may
acquire over external
objects
or things unconnected with.
his person , which
are
styled jura rerum or the rights of
things (e) .
Wrongs
also are
divisible
into , first , private
wrongs , which , infringing merely particular
rights ,
con-
cern individuals
only , and
are called civil injuries
; and
secondly , public wrongs , which being in breach of general
and public
rights ,
affect the whole
community , and are
called crimes and misdemeanors .
Wrongs are
1. private or
2. public.
1. Rights
respecting
persons;
Regard being
had to the above
fourfold
division , the
present Commentaries will consist of the following
parts :
1. The rights
of persons ; with the means whereby such
rights may be either
acquired
or lost .
2. The rights of
things ; with the means
also
of
acquiring
and
losing
them .
3. Private wrongs ,
or
civil injuries , including
breaches of contract ; with the means of redressing them
by law.
4. Public wrongs or crimes ; with the means of
preventing and punishing
them .
First we are to consider the rights of persons ; with the
means of acquiring
and losing them .
divisions of
Now the rights of persons that are commanded to be
such rights. observed
by the municipal
law are of two sorts : first, such
as are due from every citizen , which
are usually called
civil duties ; and , secondly , such as belong to him, which
is the more popular
acceptation of rights
or jura.
Both
may indeed be comprised
in this latter
division
; for , as
all social duties are of a relative nature , at the same time
that they are due from one man , or set of men , they must

also be due to another .
But I apprehend it will be more
clear
and
easy , to
consider
many of them as duties re-
quired from , rather than as rights belonging
to , particular
persons .
Thus , allegiance
is usually , and therefore most
easily , considered as the duty of the people , and protection
as the duty of the magistrate ; and yet they are , recipro-
cally, the rights as well
as
duties of each other .
Alle-
giance is the right of the magistrate , and protection the
right of the people.

rights
.
By the absolute rights
of
individuals
we mean those Absolute
which are
so
in
their primary
and strictest
sense
;
such
as
would belong
to
their persons merely
in
a
state
of
nature
,
and which
every man
is
entitled
to
enjoy
,
whether out
of
society
or
in
it
.
But with regard
to
the absolute duties
,
which man
is
bound
to
perform
,
considered
as
a
mere
individual
,
it
is
not
to
be expected that any human muni-
cipal law should
at
all explain
or
enforce
them
.
For the
end and intent
of
such laws
being
only
to
regulate the
behaviour
of
mankind
,
as
they are members
of
society
,
and stand
in
various
relations
to
each other
,
they have
consequently
no
concern with any other than
social
or
relative
duties
.
Let
a
man therefore be ever
so abandoned
in
his principles
,
or
vicious
in
his practice
,
provided
he

keeps his
wickedness
to himself, and
does
not
offend
against the
public
peace
or
against the
rules
of public
decency
and decorum , he is out of the reach of human
laws .
But if he makes his vices public , though they be
such as seem principally to affect himself, they may then
become , by the bad example
they set , of pernicious effect
to society ; and therefore it may then be the business of
human laws
to
correct them .
Here the circumstance of
publicity
is what
alters the nature
of the
case .
Public
sobriety is
a
relative
duty ,
the breach
of
which
may
expose
to punishment
;
private
sobriety
is an absolute
duty , whether
it be performed
or not , human tribunals
cannot know , and therefore they cannot enforce it by any
civil
sanction .
But with respect to rights, the case is
different .
Human
laws define
and enforce
as well those
rights which belong to a man considered as an individual
,
as
those
which
belong
to him considered
as related to
others .
For the principal
aim of society is to protect individuals
in the
enjoyment of those
absolute
rights ,
which
were
vested in them by the immutable
laws
of nature ; but
which could not be preserved in peace without that mutual
assistance and intercourse which
is gained by the institu-
tion of friendly and
social
communities .
Hence it fol-
lows , that the first and primary
end of human
laws is to
maintain
and regulate these absolute rights of individuals
.
Such rights as are social and relative result
from , and are
posterior to, the formation of states
and societies
:
so that
to maintain
and regulate
these,
is clearly a subsequent
consideration .
And therefore the principal view of human
law is , or ought
to be, to explain , protect ,
and enforce
such rights
as
are absolute , which
in themselves are few
and simple ; and then such
rights
as are relative , which ,
arising
from
a variety of connexions , will
be far
more
numerous and more complicated .
These latter will take
up a greater
space
in any
code
of laws , and hence may
appear to be more attended to, though in reality they are

not, than rights of the
former
kind.
Let
us therefore
proceed to examine how far all laws ought to, and how far
the laws of England actually
do , take notice of absolute
rights , and provide for their lasting
security .
The absolute rights of man , considered as a free agent ,
endowed with discernment to know good from
evil , and
with power of choosing those measures which appear to
him to be most desirable , are usually
summed up in one
general appellation , and denominated the natural liberty
of mankind .
This
natural
liberty consists
properly in a
power of acting
as one thinks
fit
,
without any restraint
or
control
,
unless
by the law of
nature
;
being
a
right
inherent
in
us
by birth
,
and one
of
the gifts of God
to
man
at
his creation
,
when he was endued with the faculty
of free
-
will
.
But every man
,
when he enters
into society
,
gives up
a
part
of
his
natural
liberty
as
the price
of
so
valuable
a
purchase
;
and
,
in
consideration
of
receiving
the advantages
of
intercourse with his fellowmen
,
obliges
himself
to
conform
to
those laws
,
which
the community
has thought proper
to
establish
.
This
species
of
legal
obedience and conformity
is
infinitely
more desirable than
that wild and
savage liberty which
is
sacrificed
to
obtain
it
.
For no man who
considers
a
moment would wish to
retain the absolute and uncontrolled
power
of
doing what-
ever he pleases
:
conceding
to
every other man the
same
power
for then there would be no security
to
individuals
in
any
of
the enjoyments
of
life
.
Political therefore
,
or
Political
or
civil liberty
,
which
is
that

a
member

,
is
no
other than natural liberty
so

laws
as
is
necessary and expedient for the general advan-
tage
of
the public

).
Hence
we may
collect

law, which
restrains
a man
from
doing
mischief
to his
fellow-citizens , though it diminishes the natural , increases
the civil liberty of mankind
; but that
every wanton and
causeless
restraint
of the will of the
subject ,
whether
practised by a monarch , a nobility or a popular assembly ,
is in a degree
tyranny : nay , that
even
laws themselves ,
whether made with or without
our consent , if they regu-
late and constrain our conduct in
matters
of mere indif-
ference, without
any good
end in view ,
are
regulations
destructive of liberty : whereas , if any public
advantage
can arise from observing such precepts, the control of our
private inclinations , in one or
two particular
points , will
conduce to preserve our general freedom in others of more
importance ; by
supporting
that
state of society ,
which
alone can secure
our
independence .
Thus
the
statute of
king Edward IV. (g) , which
forbad the fine gentlemen of
those times (under
the
degree of a lord ) to wear pikes
upon their
shoes
or boots of more than
two inches in
length , was a law that
savoured of oppression ; because ,
however ridiculous
the fashion then in use might appear,
the restraining
it by pecuniary penalties
could
serve
no
purpose of common
utility .
But
the
statute of king
Charles II. ( ) , which
prescribed
a thing
seemingly
as
deavours , with
how little , not how
much , of this
restraint , the com-
munity can subsist .
For liberty is
a good to be improved , and
not
an
evil to be lessened .
It is not only
a private
blessing of the first order ,
but the vital
spring
or
energy
of
the state itself, which
has just so
much life
and
vigour
as
there is
liberty in it."
" The liberty of man in
society
is to be under no other
legislative
power , but that established
by con-
sent
in
the
commonwealth
; nor
under the dominion
of any will , or
restraint
of any law, but what that
legislature
shall enact, according
to
the trust put in it.
Freedom
of
men under government is to have a
standing
rule to live by , common to
every one of that society , and made
by the legislative
power erected in
it ; a liberty to follow my own will
in all things , where the rule
pre-
scribes

not to be subject
to the
inconstant ,
uncertain , un-
known,
arbitrary

(a dress for the dead, who were ordered
to be
buried
in woollen ), was
a law
consistent
with public
liberty ; for it encouraged the
staple
trade , on which
in
great measure depended
the universal
good of the nation .
So that laws , when prudently
framed , are by no means
subversive
but rather introductive
of liberty ; for (as Mr.
Locke has well observed
(i) ) where there is no law there is
no freedom .
But then , on the other hand , that constitu-
tion or frame of government , that system of laws , is alone
calculated
to maintain
civil liberty , which
leaves
the sub-
ject entire
master of his own
conduct , except in
those
points wherein the public good requires some direction
or

of it.
English
The idea and practice of this
political
or civil liberty on the
flourish
in their highest vigour
in these kingdoms , where liberties.
the freedom accorded to each individual member of the
community
, falls little short of perfection , and
can only
be lost or destroyed by the folly or demerits of its owner :
the legislature , and of course the laws of England , being
peculiarly
adapted
to the preservation of this inestimable
blessing
even in the meanest subject .
And this spirit of
liberty is so
deeply
implanted
in our
constitution
,
and
rooted even in our very soil , that
a
slave , the moment he
lands in England , falls under
the protection of the laws ,
and may successfully assert his freedom (k).
The absolute rights of every Englishman
(which , taken
in a political
and
extensive
sense ,
are usually called his
liberties ), as they
are
founded
on nature
and reason , so
are
they
coeval with our form of government ; though
subject at times
to fluctuate and change : their establish-
ment
(excellent
as it is) being still human .
At some
periods
they
have
been
depressed
by
overbearing
and
tyrannical
princes ; at others they have grown
so luxuriant
as even to tend
to anarchy ,
a worse state than tyranny
itself, as any government
is better than none at all .

152
THE ABSOLUTE
RIGHTS
OF INDIVIDUALS
.
The charters
of our
liberties.
the vigour of our free constitution
has always
delivered
the nation from these
embarrassments
: and ,
as soon as
the
convulsions
consequent
on the struggle
have been
over, the
balance of
our rights
and liberties
has again
settled , more or less
nearly , to its proper
level ; and the
fundamental
articles , on which those rights
and liberties
are
based,
have
been from
time
to time
asserted in
parliament ,
as
often
as
they
were
thought
to
be in
danger .
First , by the
great
charter
of
liberties ,
which
was
obtained , sword
in hand ,
from
king John ,
and
after-
wards , with some alterations , confirmed in parliament by
king Henry III . , his
son (1) .
Which charter
contained
very few new grants
; but ,
as
sir
Edward
Coke (m) ob-
serves , was for the most part declaratory of the principal
grounds of the fundamental
laws of England.
After-
wards
by the
statute
called
confirmatio
cartarum (n) ,
whereby the great
charter
is
directed to
be allowed
as
the common law ; all judgments
contrary to it are declared
void ; copies of it are ordered to be sent to all cathedral
churches , and read twice
a year to the people ; and sen-
tence of excommunication
is directed to be
as constantly
denounced against those who by word , deed , or counsel ,
should act contrary thereto , or in
any degree
infringe it.
Next , by a multitude
of subsequent corroborating
statutes
(sir Edward Coke reckons thirty-two (o) ) , from the first
Edward to Henry IV.
Then , after
a long interval , by
the petition
of right (p) ;
which
was
a parliamentary
declaration of the liberties
of the
people , assented to by
king
Charles
I. in the
beginning
of his
reign .
This
was closely followed by the still more ample
concessions
made by that unhappy
prince to his
parliament , before
the fatal
rupture
between them ; and by the many
salu-
tary laws , particularly
the
habeas
corpus act (q) , passed

under Charles II.
To these succeeded
the bill of rights ,
or declaration
delivered by the lords and commons to the
prince and princess of Orange ,
13
February
1688
; and
afterwards
enacted
in parliament
(r) when
they became
king and
queen :
which
declaration
concludes in these
remarkable words ; " and they
do
claim ,
demand , and
insist upon , all and singular the
premises ,
as their un-
doubted rights and liberties ."
And the act of parliament
itself recognizes " all and
singular the rights
and liber-
ties asserted and claimed in the said declaration to be the
true , ancient , and indubitable
rights of the people of this
kingdom . "
Lastly , these liberties were again asserted
at
the commencement of the
present century , in the act of
settlement
(s),
whereby the crown was
limited
to her
present
Majesty's
illustrious
house ; and some new pro-
visions
were added , at the
same
fortunate
era , for better
securing
our
religion , laws ,
and
liberties ;
which
the
statute
declares
to be "the birthright of the people of
England ," according to the ancient doctrine of the common
law (t).
Thus much for the declaration of our rights
and liber-
ties .
The
rights
themselves ,
thus
broadly
defined by
these several
statutes, consist in a number of private
im-
munities ; which may be
reduced to three principal
or
primary
articles ; I. , the right of personal
security
; II. ,
the right
of personal
liberty
;
and , III. ,
the
right of
private
property :
because , as there is no other known
method
of compulsion ,
or of abridging
man's
natural
free-will, but by an infringement
or diminution
of one or
other of these important
rights , the preservation of them ,
inviolate , may justly be said to
include
the preservation
of our civil immunities in their largest and widest sense .
personal

The right of personal
security consists in a person's

1. Life is the immediate gift of God , a right inherent by
nature in every individual
.
Even
an infant
in
ventre
sa
mere , or in the mother's
womb , is , for many
purposes
which will be specified in the
course
of these Commen-
taries , treated in law as if actually born .
2. A man's limbs (by which
for the present we under-
stand those members which may be useful to him in fight ,
and the loss of which
alone amounts to " mayhem " (u)
by the common law) are also the gift of the wise Creator ,
to enable him to protect himself from external injuries
in
a state of nature .
To these therefore
he has a natural
inherent right ; and they cannot be wantonly
destroyed or
disabled without
a manifest breach of civil liberty .
Both the life and limbs of a man are of such high value ,
in the estimation of the law of England , that even homi-
cide if committed
se
defendendo
, or in order to preserve
them , is dispunishable
(x) .
For whatever
is
done
by a
man , to save either
life or member , is looked
upon
as
done upon the highest necessity and compulsion .
There-
fore if a man through fear of death or mayhem is prevailed
upon to execute a deed , or do any other legal
act ; such
act, though accompanied with all other requisite solemni-
ties , may be afterwards avoided , if forced upon him
by a
well-grounded
apprehension
of losing life, or
even limb ,
in case of his non -compliance (y) .
The constraint
a man
is under in these circumstances
is called in law duress ,
from the Latin
durities , of which
there
are two
sorts ;
duress of imprisonment
, where
a man actually
loses
his
liberty , of which we shall presently speak ; and duress per
minas , where the hardship
is only threatened and impend-
ing , which is that we are now discoursing of.
Duress per
minas is either
for fear of loss of life , or else for fear of
mayhem , or loss of limb .
And this fear must
be upon
sufficient
reason ;

The mere fear of having one's goods taken away
or
injured
would
not justify homicide , though
it might
perhaps afford ground for recovering
money paid to
save
them (a ) .
Should the threat be performed , a man may have
satisfaction
by recovering equivalent damages (b) : but no
suitable
atonement
can be
made for the loss of life , or
limb .
And the
indulgence
shown to a man
under this ,
the principal, sort of duress , the fear of losing his life or
limbs , agrees
also with a maxim of the civil law ; ignos-
cendum
censuerunt
ei , qui sanguinem
suum qualiter qualiter
redemptum voluit (c).
The law not only regards life and member , and protects
every man in the enjoyment of them, but
also furnishes
him with everything necessary for his support .
For there
is no man so indigent
or wretched , but he may obtain a
supply sufficient for the necessaries
of life from the more
opulent part of the community , by means of the several
statutes
enacted for the relief of the poor , of which in
their proper

emperor Con-

prevent the murder and exposure of infants , an institution
founded
on the same
principle
as our foundling
hospitals ,
though
comprised in the
Theodosian
code (d) , were re-
jected in Justinian's collection .
These
rights , of life and member , can only be deter-
mined by the death of the person ; which was formerly
accounted to be either a civil or a natural
death.

the realm (e) by the process of the
common law, or en-
tered into religion ; that is , went into a monastery , and
became
there a monk professed : in any of which
cases he
was absolutely dead in law, and his next heir became
en-
titled to his estate .
For such banished man was entirely
cut off from society ; and
such
a monk,
upon
his pro-
fession ,
renounced
solemnly
all
secular
concerns
and
besides , as the popish clergy claimed
exemption
from the
duties of civil life and the
commands of the temporal
magistrate , the genius
of the English
laws
would
not
suffer those persons to enjoy the
benefits of society, who
secluded themselves from it, and refused to submit
to its
regulations (ƒ) .
A monk was therefore
accounted civi-
liter mortuus, and when he
entered
into religion
might ,
like other dying men , make his testament and executors ;
or , if he made none , the ordinary might grant adminis-
tration to his next of kin , as if he were actually dead in-
testate .
And such executors and administrators
had the
same power , and might bring the same actions for debts ,
due to the religious , and were liable
to the
same actions
for
debts
due from him, as if he were
naturally
de-
ceased (g) .
Nay , so far has this
principle
been
carried ,
that when
one was bound in a bond
to an abbot and his
successors , and
afterwards
made his
executors , and pro-
fessed himself a monk of the same abbey, and in process
of time was himself made abbot
thereof ; here the law
gave him, in the capacity of abbot , an action
of debt
against
his
own executors to recover the money due (h).
In short , a monk
or religious was
so effectually dead in
(e) To abjure the realm is a civil
death , because it is
to
leave
the
realm for ever ; and so if a man be
attainted
of treason or felony , and ,
saving his life , is banished
for ever,
this also is a civil death .
But if
a man , by act
of
parliament ,
be
exiled
but for a time , which
some
call
a
relegation , that is no civil
death .

law , that a lease made even to a third person , during
the
life, generally , of one who
afterwards
became
a monk ,
determined
by such
his
entry
into
religion
: for which
reason leases , and other conveyances
for life, were usually
made
to
have and to hold
for the term of one's natural
life (i).
But , even in the
times
of popery , the
law
of
England
took
no
cognizance of " profession "
in
any
foreign country , because
the fact could not be tried in our
courts (4) ; and , since the Reformation , this disability
has
been held to be abolished (7) :
so also has been the dis-
ability of banishment ,
consequent upon
abjuration , by
statute 21 Jac.
1 , c. 28.
This
natural
life being ,
as
was before
observed
, the
immediate
donation
of the
Creator , cannot legally be
disposed of or destroyed by the
person himself, nor by a
fellow- creature ,
merely
upon
his
own
authority .
Yet
nevertheless it may , under certain
circumstances , be for-
feited for the breach of social
laws , as to which , we may
hereafter
more
conveniently
inquire
in the
concluding
book of these Commentaries .
At present , I
shall
only
observe , that whenever the constitution
of a state vests in
any man , or body of men , a power of destroying
at plea-
sure , without
the direction
of laws , the lives or members
of the subjects , such constitution
is in the highest
degree
tyrannical
:
and
that
whenever
any
laws
direct
such
destruction
for light and trivial causes , such laws are like-
wise
tyrannical ,
though
in
an
inferior
degree
:
because
here each subject is aware of the danger he is exposed
to ,
and
may by prudent
caution
provide
against
it.
The
law of England therefore
never inflicts any punishment
extending
to life unless upon the highest necessity
and
the
constitution
is
an
utter
stranger
to
any
arbitrary
power of killing or maiming
the subject without
the ex-
press warrant
of law.

Which
words , " aliquo modo destruatur ," according to sir Edward
Coke ( n ) , include
a prohibition
not
only of killing
and
maiming , but
also of torturing (to which our
laws
are
strangers (o) ) , and of every oppression
by colour
of an
illegal authority .
And it is enacted
by the statute 5 Ed . 3 ,
c. 9 , that no man shall be forejudged of life or limb , con-
trary to the great
charter and the law of the land

again , by statute 28 Ed . 3 , c. 3, that no man

being
brought
to answer
by due

viduals.
This
personal
liberty
consists in the power of
loco -motion , of
changing
situation ,
or removing
one's
person
to
whatsoever
place one's
own
inclination
may
direct ; without
imprisonment
or restraint , unless
by due
course of law .
Concerning which we may make the same.
observations
as upon
the
preceding
article ; that it is a
right
strictly natural
; that
the laws of England do not
assume to abridge it without sufficient
cause ; and , that
in this kingdom it cannot
ever
be abridged
without
the
explicit permission of the laws .
Here again the language
of the great charter (q ) is , that no freeman shall be taken
or imprisoned , but by the law of the land .
And
subse-
quent old statutes (r) expressly direct , that no
man
shall
be taken
or imprisoned
by suggestion
or petition
to the
king
or his
council , unless it be by legal
indictment , or
by the process of the
common law.
By the petition of
right , 3 Car .
1 , it is enacted , that no freeman shall be im-
prisoned
or detained without
cause
shown , to which
he
may make answer according to law.
By 16 Car . 1 , c. 10 ,
if any person
be
restrained of his liberty by order or
decree of any illegal
court, or by command of the king's
majesty in person , or by warrant of the council board , or
of any of the privy council
;
he shall , upon demand of his
counsel , have a writ of habeas
corpus, to bring his
body
before the court
of king's bench or common pleas ; who
shall determine whether the cause
of his commitment
be
just, and thereupon do as to justice
shall appertain .
And
by 31 Car . 2 , c. 2 , commonly called the habeas corpus act,
the methods of obtaining
this writ are so plainly pointed
out
and
enforced
, that , so long
as
this
statute remains
unimpeached , no subject of England can be long detained
in prison , except in those cases in which the law requires
and justifies such detainer .
And , lest this act should
be
evaded by demanding
unreasonable
bail , or sureties for

c. 8 ; 25 Edw. 3,

}
the prisoner's appearance, it is declared by 1 Will. & M.
st. 2 , c. 2 , that excessive
bail ought not to be required .
The statute 56 Geo. 3, c . 100 , " An act for more effec-
tually securing the liberty of the subject ," extends to the
case where a person
is restrained of his liberty for some
matter
otherwise
than
criminal
provisions
for ensuring
due enquiry into the grounds of detention by writ of habeas
corpus.
And
the
right of
personal
liberty
has
been
further
protected by the
abolition
of arrest
for debt on
mesne
process (s), except in certain
cases ; and on final
process , where the judgment
debt does
not , exclusive of
costs ,
exceed
the
sum of 207. (t) .
The
policy of the
recent bankrupt
acts has tended in the same direction .
Of great importance
to the public is the preservation of
personal liberty
: for if once it were left in the power of
any, the highest , magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whom-
ever he or his officers
thought
proper , there would
soon
be an end of all
other rights and immunities .
Unjust
attacks , even upon life , or property , at the arbitrary will
of the magistrate , are less dangerous to the commonwealth
than
such as are made upon the
personal
liberty of the
subject .
To bereave
a man of life , or by violence to con-
fiscate his estate , without
accusation or trial , would be so
gross and notorious an act of despotism , as must at once
convey the alarm
of tyranny throughout
the whole king-
dom ; but confinement of the person , by secretly hurrying
a man to gaol , where his
sufferings
are unknown
or for-
gotten , is a less public ,
a less striking, and therefore
a
more
dangerous
engine
of arbitrary
government .
And
yet sometimes
, when the state is in real danger , even this
may be a necessary
measure.
But the
happiness of our
constitution
is , that it is not left to the executive power
to determine when the danger of the state is
so great , as
to render this measure expedient : for it is the parliament
only , or legislative
power , that
whenever it sees proper ,

can authorize the crown , by suspending the
habeas corpus
act for a short
and limited time , to imprison
suspected
persons , and to cause them to be detained in prison with-
out bail or trial during the time
of its suspension (u) ;
as the senate of Rome was wont to have recourse to a
dictator, a magistrate of absolute
authority , when
they
judged
the
republic
in
any
imminent
danger .
The
decree of the senate ,
which
usually preceded
the nomi-
nation of this magistrate , " dent
operam
consules , ne quid
respublica detrimenti capiat ,"
was called
the senatûs
con-
sultum ultima
necessitatis .
In like manner this
experi-
ment ought only to be tried in cases of extreme emergency ;
and in these the nation
parts with its liberty for a while ,
in order to preserve it for ever.
The confinement
of the person , in any wise , is an im-
prisonment
.
So that the keeping
a man against his will
in a private house, putting him in the stocks , arresting or
forcibly
detaining
him in the
street ,
is
an imprison-
ment (x).
And the law so much
discourages
unlawful
confinement , that if a man is under duress of imprison-
ment , which was before explained to mean compulsion by
an illegal
restraint
of liberty , until he seals a bond or
the like ; he
may allege this duress , and avoid the ex-
torted bond .
But if a man be lawfully imprisoned , and

discharge ,
or
on
any
other fair
account ,
seals
a bond or
a deed, this is not by duress.

,
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
send
a
person prisoner
,
and
not
to
signify withal the
crimes
alleged against him
.
A
natural
and
regular
consequence
of
this personal
liberty
is
,
that
every Englishman may claim
a
right
to
abide
in

as

it

vice
and safeguard
of
the commonwealth
,
though
now
the writ
in
question
issues
only
under
special circum-
stances
from the Court of Chancery
.

,

of

in
ascertaining
and protecting
this right.
Upon this prin-
ciple the great
charter (f) has declared that no freeman
shall
be disseised , or divested , of his freehold
or of his
liberties , or free customs ,
but by the judgment of his
peers , or by the law of the land .
And by a variety of
ancient statutes (g) it is
enacted
, that no man's
lands or
goods
shall be
seized
into
the king's hands , against
the
great charter , and the law of the
land ; and that no man
shall be disinherited , nor put out of his franchises
or
freehold , unless
he be duly brought
to answer , and be
forejudged
by course of law ; and if any thing
be done
to the
contrary , it
shall
be redressed, and holden
for
nought .
So great moreover is the regard of the law for private

the least violation of
it.

property ,
be it ever
so minute , is a
trespass .
No
man
can
set his
foot upon
my ground
without my licence , but he is liable to an action , though
the damage
be
nothing , which
is proved by every
decla-
ration in trespass, where the defendant is called upon to
answer for bruising the grass ,
and
even
treading
upon
the soil . If he admits the
fact he is
bound to show by
way ofjustification
that some positive law has empowered
or excused him.
This justification
is submitted
to the
judges , who
are to enquire whether it can be maintained
by the
text of the
statute
or by the
principles
of the
common law.
If no such
excuse
can be found
or pro-
duced , the silence of the
books is an authority
against
the
defendant ,
and
the
plaintiff
will
be
entitled
to
judgment .

general good of the community , it cannot , except on such
conditions
as the law deems equitable , be accomplished .
If, for instance , a new road or line of railway were to be
made through the grounds
of a private
person , it might
be beneficial
to the public , but yet the law allows no man
or corporate body to
make the
road or line of railway in
question without
consent of the
owner of the land , or at
. all events without compensation being in some way or other
made to him for the infringement
of his rights of property
thus caused (i) .
In this and similar cases the legislature
alone can, and frequently
does , interpose , and compel the
individual to
acquiesce
.
But how
does it interpose and
compel ?
Not by absolutely stripping
the
subject of his
property in an
arbitrary
manner ; but by giving him an
indemnification
and
equivalent
for the injury
thereby
sustained .
All that the legislature
does , is to
oblige the
owner to alienate
his
possessions
for a reasonable price ;
and even this is an exertion
of power , which the legisla-
ture
indulges with caution ,
and which nothing but the
legislature
or some tribunal specially appointed by it for
the purpose
can perform .
As exemplifying
the above remarks , the Lands Clauses
Consolidation
Act (8 & 9 Vict. c. 18 ) , by its 68th section,
indicates
the
mode to be adopted by the owners of land
" taken
for or injuriously
affected
by" the
execution of
works falling within the purview of the act for
enforcing
compensation
as against the promoters of the undertaking
,
or as against
the public
company organised
for
carrying
it out .
What , then , is the test applicable for determining
whether
a claim for compensation
can be upheld within
the above or any similar
statutory
provision ?.
Such test
would seem to be supplied by this consideration (k) :-
There are (as will hereafter appear ( ) )
cases in which

THE ABSOLUTE
RIGHTS
OF INDIVIDUALS .
an act may be in law an injury and may produce damage
to an individual,
and yet in which the law affords
no
remedy , or at least no immediate remedy .
These are cases
in which the act done is a grievance to the entire commu-
nity, no one of whom is injured
by it more than another .
In any such case
the mode of punishing
the wrong -doer
is by indictment , and by indictment
only .
Still , if any
person
have
sustained
a
particular
damage
therefrom
beyond that of his
fellow -citizens , he may maintain
an
action in respect of that particular
damnification .
Has
then the claimant
under
a statutory
provision
such
as
above-mentioned
sustained
any particular
damnification
by the prosecution of the public undertaking
? ( m ) .
This
is the test to be applied
for determining
whether
he is
entitled to compensation (n).
" The great end for which men entered
into society was
to secure their property .
That right
is preserved
sacred

The cases where
this right
of property is
set aside by positive law are various .

tions , forfeitures , taxes , &c.,
are all of this description
;

RIGHT
TO PRIVATE
PROPERTY

or the support of government , but such as are imposed by
parliament
.
By the statute 25 Edw. 1 , c. 5 and c. 6 , it is
provided , that
the king shall not take any aids or tasks ,
but by the common assent of the realm .
And what
that
common
assent is , is more fully explained by 34 Edw .
1 ,
st. 4 , c.
1 , which
enacts , that no
tallage
or aid shall be
taken
without
the assent
of the
archbishops , bishops ,
earls, barons , knights , burgesses, and
other
freemen of
the land
and
again , by 14 Edw . 3 , st. 2 , c.
1 , the pre-
lates ,
earls , barons ,
and
commons , citizens , burgesses ,
and merchants
shall not be charged to make any aid , if it
be not by the common assent of the great men and com-
mons in parliament .
And as this fundamental
law had
been shamefully
evaded
under
many succeeding
princes ,
by compulsive
loans , and
benevolences
extorted without a
real and voluntary
consent , it was made an article
in
the
petition
of right 3 Car .
1 , that no man shall be compelled
to yield
any gift , loan , or benevolence , tax , or such like
charge , without common
consent by act of parliament .
And , lastly , by the statute
1 Will . and M. st . 2 , c. 2 , it is
declared ,
that
levying
money for or to the
use of the
crown , by pretence of prerogative , without
grant of parlia-
ment ; or for longer time , or in other manner , than the
same is or shall be granted ; is illegal .
be
of securing
petual en-
joyment of
theserights.
In the three preceding
articles we have taken a short The modes
view of the principal absolute rights which
appertain to the per-
every Englishman .
But in vain
would
these rights
declared , ascertained , and protected by the dead
letter of
the laws , if the constitution
had provided no other method
to secure their actual enjoyment .
It has therefore estab-
lished
certain
other
auxiliary
subordinate
rights
of the
subject , which
serve principally as outworks
or barriers ,
to protect
and
maintain
inviolate
the
three
great
and
primary rights , of personal security , personal liberty , and
private
property .
These are ,
1. The constitution , powers , and privileges ofparliament ,
of which I shall treat at large in the ensuing chapter .


168
THE
ABSOLUTE
RIGHTS
OF INDIVIDUALS .
2. The limitation of the king's prerogative , by bounds ,
so certain and notorious , that it is impossible
he should
either mistake or exceed
them without the consent of the
people .
Of this also I shall treat in its proper place.
The
constitution
of
parliament
keeps the
legislative
power in due health
and vigour , so
as to make it impro-
bable that laws should
be enacted
destructive
of general
liberty : the limitation
of the prerogative is a guard upon
the executive power , by restraining
it from acting either
beyond or in contradiction
to the laws , that
are framed
and established by the parliament .
3. A third
subordinate
right of every Englishman is
that
of applying
to the
courts of justice for
redress
of
injuries .
Since the law is in England the supreme arbiter
of every man's life , liberty , and property , courts of justice
must at all prescribed
times be open and available to the
subject , and the law must
be duly administered
therein .
The emphatical words of magna
carta ( p) , spoken in the
person of the king , who in judgment of law (says
sir
Edward Coke (q) ) is ever present and repeating
them in
his courts , are these ; nulli vendemus , nulli
negabimus , aut
differemus rectum
vel justitiam
: and therefore every sub-
ject, continues the same
learned
author ,
for injury done
to him in bonis , terris , vel personâ , by any other subject ,
be he
ecclesiastical
or temporal , without
any exception ,
" may take his remedy by the course of the law, and have
justice
and right for the injury done to him , freely without
sale,
fully
without
any
denial ,
and
speedily
without
delay ."
It were endless
to enumerate all the affirmative
acts of parliament , wherein
justice is directed to be done
according to the law of the land : and what
that law is,
every subject
knows , or may know if he pleases
; for it
depends not upon
the arbitrary will of any judge , but is
permanent , fixed , and
unchangeable , unless by authority
of parliament . I shall however just mention
a few nega-
tive
statutes , whereby abuses ,
perversions ,
or
delays of

OTHER
SUBORDINATE
RIGHTS .

justice , especially by the prerogative , are restrained .
It
is ordained
by magna
carta (r) , that no freeman shall be
outlawed , that is put out of the protection and benefit of
the
laws , but according
to the law of the land .
By 2
Edw. 3, c. 8, and
11 Ric . 2 , c. 10 , it is
enacted , that
no
commands
or letters shall be sent under
the great
seal ,
little seal , signet , or privy seal , in disturbance of the law ;
or to disturb
or delay common right : and , though
such
commandments
should come , the judges
shall
not
cease
to do right ; which
is also made
a part of their oath by
statute
18 Edw. 3 , st . 4.
And by
1 Will . and M. st. 2 ,
c. 2 , it is declared , that the pretended power of suspend-
ing , or
dispensing with laws , or the
execution of laws ,
by regal
authority , without
consent
of parliament , is
illegal (s).
For
Not only the
substantial
part , or judicial decisions , of
the law , but also the formal part or method of proceeding ,
cannot
be altered but by or with the sanction
of parlia-
ment: for , if once those outworks were demolished , there
would be an inlet to all manner of innovation
in the body
of the law itself.
The king , it is true , may erect new
courts
of justice
; but then they must proceed according
to the
old -established
forms of the common law.
which reason it was declared in the statute 16 Car . 1 , c. 10 ,
upon
the dissolution
of the court of star-chamber , that
neither
his majesty , nor his privy council , have any juris-
diction ,
power,
or
authority
by English
bill ,
petition ,
articles , libel (which were the course of proceeding
in the
star-chamber , borrowed from the
civil law) ,
or by any
other arbitrary
way whatsoever , to examine , or draw into
question , determine , or
dispose of the lands
or goods of
any subjects of this
kingdom
; but that the same ought
to be tried
and
determined
in
the
ordinary
courts of
justice , and by course of law.

THE
ABSOLUTE
RIGHTS
OF INDIVIDUALS .
infringement
of the rights before
mentioned , which the
ordinary course of law is too defective to reach , there still
remains a fourth subordinate
right , appertaining
to every
individual, namely
the right
of petitioning
the king , or
either house of parliament , for the redress of grievances .
In Russia we are told (t) that the Czar Peter established
a law, that no subject might
petition
the throne , till he
had first petitioned
two different
ministers of state.
In
case
he
obtained justice from neither , he
might
then
present a third
petition
to the
prince ; but upon pain of
death if found
to be in the wrong .
The consequence
of
which was, that no one dared to offer such third petition
:
and, grievances
seldom falling
under the notice of the
sovereign , he had little opportunity
to redress them .
The
restrictions , for some there are, which
are laid upon peti-
tioning in England , are of a nature
extremely different
;
and while they
promote
the
spirit of peace , they are no
check upon
that of liberty.
Care
only
must be taken ,
lest , under
the
pretence
of
petitioning
, the subject
be
guilty of any riot or tumult ;
as happened in the opening
of the
memorable
parliament
in
1640
; and , to prevent
this , it is provided
by the
statute
13 Car . 2 , st.
1 , c. 5 ,
that no petition to the king , or either house of parliament ,
for any alteration
in church
or
state , shall be signed by
above twenty persons ,
unless the matter
thereof
be ap-
proved by three justices of the peace , or by the major part
of the grand jury , in the
country (u) ; and in London by
the lord mayor , aldermen , and common council : nor shall
any petition
be presented by more
than ten persons at a
time .
But it is declared by the stat.
1 Will . & M. st. 2 ,
c. 2, that the subject
has a right to petition
; and that all
commitments
and
prosecutions
for such
petitioning
are
illegal .
This later enactment
does
not indeed repeal the

of the grand

may
be

or

nized
as operative , are not
ordinarily
enforced .
Lastly ,
we may add that meetings
of more than fifty persons for
the purpose
of petitioning
the
parliament , held within
one mile of Westminster
Hall , are illegal (y) .
5.
The fifth
and
last
auxiliary right of the
subject
which I shall
at present mention , is that of having arms
for defence, suitable to his condition
and degree , and such
as are allowed
by law.
Which
is also declared by the
same statute
1 Will . & M.
st. 2 , c. 2 , and it is indeed a
public allowance , under
due
restrictions , of the natural
right of resistance and self -preservation , when the sanc-
tions of society and laws are found insufficient
to restrain
the violence of oppression .
In these several articles
consist the rights , or, as they
are frequently
termed , the liberties of Englishmen
: liber-
ties , more
generally
talked
of than thoroughly
under-
stood ; and yet highly necessary to be perfectly
known
and considered by every man of rank or property , lest his
ignorance of the
points
whereon they are founded should
hurry him into faction
and licentiousness on the one hand ,
or
a pusillanimous
indifference
and
criminal
submission
on the other .
And we have
seen
that
these rights con-
sist , primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security ,
of personal liberty , and of private
property .
So long as
these remain
inviolate , the
subject is perfectly free ; for
every species
of compulsive
tyranny and oppression must

George
Gordon , the whole
court , including

of Rights, 1 Will. & M. st . 2, c. 2

Mr.
Dunning,
however ,
in

contended ,
" that it was

country
that the people
had
a
right to petition
their representa-
tives in parliament , and that it was
by no means true that
the
number
of names
signed
to any such peti-
tion
was limited.
To
argue
that
the act of Charles
was now in force
would be as absurd
as to pretend
that the prerogative
of the Crown
still remained in its full extent not-
withstanding
the declaration
in the
Bill of Rights."

act in opposition to one
or
other of these rights , having
no other object upon which
it can possibly
be employed .
To preserve these from violation , it is necessary that the
constitution of parliament
be supported in its full vigour
;
and that limits , certainly known , be set to the royal pre-
rogative .
And
lastly,
to vindicate
these rights ,
when
actually violated or attacked , the subjects of England are
entitled , in the first place , to the regular
administration.
and free course of justice
in the courts of law ; next , to
the
right of petitioning
the king
and
parliament
for
redress
of grievances ; and , lastly , to the right of having
and
using
arms for self -preservation
and
defence .
And
these rights
and
liberties
it is our birthright
to enjoy
entire ; unless where the laws of our
country have laid
them under necessary
restraints-restraints in themselves
so
gentle
and
moderate,
as will
appear
upon
further
inquiry, that no man of sense or probity
would
wish
to
see them slackened .
For all of us have it in our choice
to do everything
that a good man would desire to do ; and
are restrained from nothing , but what would be pernicious
either to ourselves or to our fellow -citizens .
So that this
review of our
situation
may justify the observation of a
learned
French author (2), who
generally both
thought
and wrote in the
spirit of genuine
freedom ;
that
the
English is the only nation in the world where political or
civil liberty is the direct end of its constitution .
Recom-
mending

student of our laws
a further
and more
accurate search into
this
extensive
and

title , I shall
close my remarks

CHAPTER II.
THE
PARLIAMENT .
We are next to treat of the rights and duties of persons,
as they are members
of society,
and
stand
in various
relations
to each other.
These relations
are either public
or private
and we will
first
consider
those
that
are
public.
The most
universal
public
relation , by which men are
connected
together , is that of government
; namely , as
governors and governed , or , in other words , as magistrates
and people .
Of magistrates
one , according
to our con-
stitution, is
supreme , in whom
the sovereign
power of
the
state resides ; others
are
subordinate , deriving
their
authority from the supreme
magistrate , accountable to
him for their conduct , and acting in an inferior secondary
sphere .
In all tyrannical
governments
the supreme magistracy ,
or the right both of making
and of enforcing the laws , is
vested in one and the same man , or in
one and the
same
body of men ; and wherever
these
two powers
are united
together , there can be no public
liberty.
The magistrate
may enact tyrannical
laws , and execute them in a tyran-
nical
manner , since he
possesses , in quality of dispenser
of justice, all the power which
he
as legislator
thinks
proper to give himself.
But , where the legislative and the
executive authority
are
in distinct
hands , the former will
take care not to intrust
the
latter with so large a power
as may tend to the subversion of its
own independence ,
and therewith
of the
liberty
of the
subject .
With us


174
THE
PARLIAMENT.
Origin of
parliaments.
therefore in England this supreme power is divided
into
two branches ; the one
legislative , to wit, the parliament ,
consisting
of king , lords ,
spiritual
and
temporal ,
and
commons ; the other
executive ,
consisting
of the king
alone.
It will be the business of this chapter to consider
the British
parliament
; in which
the
legislative
power ,
and (of course ) the supreme and absolute authority of the
state, is vested by our constitution .
The origin or first institution of parliament
is one of
those matters which
lie so far hidden in the dark ages of
antiquity , that the
tracing
of it out is
a thing equally
difficult and
uncertain .
The word " parliament " itself,
(parlement or colloquium, as some of our historians trans-
late it) , is comparatively
of modern
date (a) ;
derived
from the French , and signifying
an
assembly that
met
and conferred
together .
It is
certain that, long before
the introduction
of the Norman language
into England ,
all matters of importance were debated and settled in the
great councils of the realm .
A practice , which seems to
have been universal
among the northern nations , particu-
larly the Germans (b) ;
and
carried
by
them
into
the
countries of Europe , which they overran at the dissolution
of the
Roman
empire .
Relics
of which constitution ,
under various modifications
and changes, were formerly to
be met with in the diets of Poland , Germany , and Sweden,
and the assembly of the
estates in France
: but what was
there called the parliament
was only the supreme court of
justice,
consisting
of the
peers ,
certain
dignified
eccle-
siastics , and judges
; which neither was in practice , nor
was
supposed to be in theory , a general
council of the
realm .
(a) Mr. Millar (Eng. Gov. ii., 85,
et seq.)
considers
that
the
great
assembly
of the
realm
which suc-
ceeded the Witenagemôt
was first
called "the
parliament

THE
ORIGIN
OF
PARLIAMENTS
.
175
With us in England this general council has been held
immemorially
, under the several
names of michel -synoth ,
or great council , michel -gemote or great meeting , and more
frequently
witena-gemot or the meeting
of wise men (c) .
It was variously
styled in Latin , commune
concilium
regni ,
magnum concilium regis, curia magna , conventus
magnatum
vel procerum , assisa generalis , and sometimes
communitas
regni Anglice (d ) .
We have instances of its meeting to
order the affairs of the kingdom, to make new laws , and
to
amend
the
old , or,
as Fleta (e) expresses
it , " noris
injuriis
emersis
nova
constituere
remedia," so early as the
reign
of Ina king of the West Saxons , Offa king of the
Mercians , and Ethelbert king of Kent , in
the
several
realms
of the heptarchy .
And , after their union , the
Mirror (f) informs
us, that
king Alfred ordained
for
a
perpetual
usage , that these councils should meet twice in
the year , or oftener , if need be , to treat of the government
of God's people ; how they should
keep themselves from
sin , should
live in quiet , and should
receive right.
Our
succeeding
Saxon
and
Danish
monarchs
held
frequent
councils
of this
sort,
as
appears
from their respective
codes of laws ; the titles whereof usually
speak them to
be
enacted , either by the king with the
advice of his
witena -gemôt
or wise men ,
as , " This is the
ordinance.
(c) "As the
freemen
or allodial
proprietors
of a tything, of a hun-
dred , and of a shire , determined
the
common
affairs of their several dis-
tricts, and were
convened
for that
purpose
by the tything-man , the
hundreder ,
and
the
alderman
; so
the union of people
belonging
to
different
shires
produced
a greater
assembly ,
consisting
of
all
the
allodial proprietors
of a kingdom ,

There is also no doubt
but similar great
councils were
occasionally held
under the
first
princes of the Norman
line (k) .
Glanvil , who wrote in the reign
of Henry the
Second, speaking of the particular
amount of an amerce-
ment in the sheriff's
court , says , it had never
been
yet
ascertained by the
general
assize , or assembly , but was
left to the custom of particular
counties ( 1) .
Here
the
general assize
is spoken of as a meeting well known , and
its
statutes
or
decisions
are put in
manifest
contra-
distinction
to custom , or the common law.
In Edward
III.'s time
an act of
parliament , made in the reign
of
William
the Conqueror , was pleaded in the
case of the
abbey of St.
Edmund's -bury ,
and judicially allowed
by
the court (m).
Hence , it appears , that general councils
are coeval with
the kingdom itself.
How those councils were constituted
and composed
, is another question , which has been matter
of dispute among our learned antiquaries ; and particularly
whether the
commons
were at all summoned to attend
them ;

a distinct
assembly (n ) .
But it is not my intention
here to enter into controversies of this
sort . It is gene-
rally agreed, that in the main
the constitution
of par-
liament, as it now stands , was marked
out
so
long
ago
as the seventeenth year of king John , A.D.
1215 , in the
great charter granted by that prince : wherein he promises
to
summon
all archbishops , bishops , abbots , earls, and
greater barons , personally
; and all other tenants in chief
under the crown , by the sheriff and bailiffs ; to meet at a
certain
place , with forty days' notice , to
assess
aids and
scutages
when necessary.
And , although
the
above
re-
markable
provision
does
not
appear in the
charter of
Henry III. , this
constitution
has
subsisted
in
fact
at
least
from the year
1266 (49 Hen. 3) , there
being still
extant writs of that date, to summon
knights , citizens ,
and
burgesses , to parliament .
I proceed
therefore
to
the subject
heads.
inquire wherein
consists this
constitution
of parliament ,
as it now
stands ,
and
has
stood
for
the
space
of six
hundred
years.
And in the prosecution
of this
inquiry , Division of
I shall consider , first , the manner and time of its assem- under seven

parts : thirdly, the laws
and
customs

as
one

body :
fourthly
and
fifthly, the laws
and
customs
relating
to each

method of

statutes , in both houses
: and
lastly, the
manner
of the
parliament's
adjournment ,
prorogation , and dissolution .

178
THE
PARLIAMENT .
parliament
was regularly
to be summoned
by the king's
writ
or letter ,
issued out of chancery by advice of the
privy council , and according
to the magna carta of king
John , it was
summoned
at
least forty days
before it
began to sit (p) ;
a period
which
after
the
union
with
Scotland (g)
was
extended
to
fifty days,
and
has
re-
cently (r)
been
reduced
to
thirty-five
days
from the
date of the proclamation
appointing
a time
for the first
meeting of the
parliament .
It is a branch of the
royal
prerogative , that
no parliament
can be convened by its
own
authority , or by the authority
of any,
except the
sovereign
alone.
And this prerogative
is founded upon
very good reason.
For , supposing it had a right to meet.
spontaneously , without
being
called
together , it is im-
possible to conceive that all the members , and
each
of
the
houses, would
agree
unanimously
upon
the
proper
time
and place of meeting ; and if half of the members
met , and half absented themselves , who shall
determine
which
is really the legislative
body, the part assembled ,
or that which stays away ?
It is therefore necessary that
the parliament
should be called together at a determinate
time and place : and highly becoming its dignity and inde-
pendence
, that it should be called together by none but one
of its own constituent
parts : and , of the three constituent
parts , this office can only appertain to the king or queen ;
who is
a
single
person , and whose will may be uniform
and steady ; the first
person in the nation , being superior
to
both
houses
in dignity ; and the only branch of the
legislature
that has a separate
existence, and is capable of
performing
any act at a time when no parliament
is in
being .
Nor is it an
exception
to this
rule that, by

parts

that the time between the teste and

return of the writ of summons
for the assembling
of the first par-
liament
of Great Britain should
not
be less than fifty days .

modern statute , on the demise of a king or queen , if there
be then no parliament
in being , the last parliament
shall
immediately
convene
and sit again for six months , unless
sooner prorogued or dissolved by his or her successor
; for
the parliament
thus reassembling
must
have been origin-
ally summoned by the crown (s).
It is true , that
by a statute ,
16 Car.
1 ,
c.
1 , it was
enacted
that , if the king
neglected
to call a parliament
for three years , the peers
might assemble and
issue out
writs
for
choosing
one ;
and , in
case of neglect of the
peers , the
constituents
might
meet
and
elect
one
of
themselves .
But this , if ever put in practice , would have
been
liable
to all the inconveniences I have just now
stated : and the act itself was esteemed
so highly detri-
mental and injurious
to the royal prerogative , that it was
repealed by statute
16 Car . 2 , c. 1.
From thence there-
fore no precedent can be drawn .
It is also true
that
the
convention -parliament , which
restored king Charles the
Second , met
above
a month
before his return ; the lords by their
own authority , and
the commons in pursuance of writs issued in the name of
the keepers
of the liberty of England
by authority
of
parliament
:
and
that
the
said parliament
sat till the
twenty -ninth of December , full seven
months
after the
Restoration
; and enacted
many laws , several of which
are
still in force.
But this was for the necessity of the thing,
which
supersedes
all law ; for if they had not
so met , it
was morally impossible
that the kingdom
should
have
been settled in peace .
And the first thing done after the
king's return was to pass an act declaring
this to be a
good parliament , notwithstanding
the defect of the king's
writs (t) .
So that, as the royal
prerogative
was chiefly
wounded
by their
so meeting , and
as the king himself ,
who alone
had a right to object , consented to waive the
objection ,
this
cannot
be
drawn
into
an
example in
prejudice of the rights of the crown .
Besides , we should

180
THE
PARLIAMENT
.
remember , that it was at that time a great doubt among
lawyers (u) , whether even this healing act made it a good
parliament
;
and
held
by very many in the
negative :
though it seems
to have been
too nice a scruple .
And
yet , out of abundant
caution , it was thought
necessary
to
confirm its acts in the
next
parliament , by statutes
13
Car . 2 , c. 7, and c . 14.
It is likewise
true , that at the time of the Revolution
,
A.D.
1688 , the lords
and
commons , by their own autho-
rity , and
upon the summons
of the prince
of Orange
(afterwards
king William ) , met
in
a
convention ,
and
therein disposed of the crown and kingdom .
But it must
be remembered ,
that
this
assembling
was upon
a like
principle
of necessity as at the restoration
; that
is , upon
a full
conviction
that king James the Second had abdi-
cated
the
government , and that
the throne was thereby
vacant :
which
supposition
of the
individual
members
was confirmed by their concurrent
resolution , when they
actually
came
together .
And ,
in
such
a
case
as the
palpable vacancy of a throne , it follows
ex necessitate rei ,
that the form of the royal writs must be laid aside, other-
wise no parliament
can ever meet again .
For, let us put
another possible case , and suppose , for the sake of argu-
ment , that
the whole
royal line should
at any time fail
and become
extinct , which would
indisputably
vacate
the
throne
in this situation it seems
reasonable to presume ,
that
the body of the
nation ,
consisting
of lords
and
commons , would
have a right
to
meet
and
settle
the
government ; otherwise there must be no government at
all.
And upon
this
and no other principle
did the con-
vention in
1688
assemble.
The
vacancy of the throne
was precedent
to their meeting without
any royal sum-
mons, not a consequence
of it .
They did not assemble
without writ , and then make the throne vacant ; but, the
throne being
previously vacant by the king's abdication ,
they assembled without
writ ,
as
they must
do if they
(u) Memorandum , 1 Sid . 1.


THE
MANNER
AND

181
assembled at all .
Had the throne
been full , their meeting
would not have been regular ; but , as it was empty , such
meeting
became absolutely
necessary.
And
accordingly
it is declared by statute
1 Wm . & M. st.
1 , c.
1 , that
this convention was really the two houses of parliament ,
notwithstanding
the want
of writs
or
other
defects
of
form .
So that , notwithstanding
these two capital excep-
tions which were justifiable
only on a principle of necessity
(and
each
of which , by the way , induced
a revolution
in
the government ) , the rule laid down is in general certain ,
that the sovereign , only , can convoke a parliament .
99
And this by certain ancient statutes of the realm (x) he
was bound
to
do
every year , or
oftener ,
" if need
be .'
Not that he was obliged
by these statutes to call a new
parliament
every year ; he was
obliged
only to permit
a
parliament
to sit annually
for the
redress
of grievances ,
and dispatch of business , or oftener , " if need be ."
These
last words
are
so loose
and vague ,
that
such
of
our
monarchs
as were inclined
to govern without
parliaments ,
neglected the convoking them sometimes for a very consi-
derable period , under pretence that
there was no need of
them .
The preamble , however , of the statute 16 Car . 1 ,
c.
1 , affirmed
that " by the laws
and statutes of this
realm parliaments
ought to be holden at least
once every
year for the
redress of grievances ; " and
although
this
act was
repealed
by the statute
16
Car . 2 ,
c .
1 , it was
therein
enacted , that the sitting
and holding
of parlia-
ments shall not
be intermitted
above
three years
at the
most .
And by the statute
1 Wm . & M. st. 2 , c. 2 , it is
declared
to be one of the rights
of the people , that
for
redress of all grievances , and for the amending , strength-
ening and preserving
the laws , parliaments
ought
to be
held " frequently ."
And
this
indefinite " frequently " is
again reduced to a certainty , by statute 6 Wm . & M. c . 2 ,
which
enacts
as the
statute of Charles
the Second had
done before , that a new parliament
shall
be called within
(c) 4 Edw. 3, c. 14 ;
36 Edw. 3, c. 10.

ment.
three years after the determination
of the former .
By
reason moreover of the supplies
being voted only for one
year at a time , and
the Marine
Forces
and Mutiny Acts
being likewise
passed
for one
year only , the necessity for
an annual
session of parliament
is now established , and
parliament
is never prorogued to a period beyond a year
from the operative commencement of these
acts .
II. The constituent
parts of a parliament
are the next
objects of our inquiry.
And these are , the king or queen ,
sitting
there in a royal political
capacity , and the
three
estates
of the
realm ; the
lords
spiritual (y) , the
lords
temporal (who sit, together with the king , in one house) ,
and the commons ,
who sit by themselves
in
another .
And the king and these three
estates , together , form the
great
corporation
or body politic
of the
kingdom (z) , of
which
the sovereign
is said to be caput, principium, et
finis .
For upon their coming together the sovereign meets
them ,
either
in
person
or by representation
;
without
which
there
can be no beginning
of a parliament (a) :
and he alone has the power of dissolving
them .
It is highly necessary for preserving
the balance of the
constitution , that the executive power should be a branch ,
though not the whole , of the legislative .
The total union
of these powers , we have seen (b) , would
be productive of
tyranny ; the total disjunction
of them would in the end
produce
the
same
effect , by causing
that
union
against
which it seems
to provide .
The
legislative
would
soon
become tyrannical , by making
continual
encroachments
upon , and gradually
assuming
to itself the rights
of, the
executive
power .
Thus the long
parliament
of Charles
the First, while it acted
in a constitutional
manner with
the royal concurrence , redressed
many heavy grievances ,
and established
many salutary laws .
But when the two
houses
assumed the power of legislation , in exclusion

the royal authority , they soon
after assumed
likewise the
reins
of
administration
;
and
the
republican
form
of
government
was speedily transformed
into a protectorate
or dictatorship
, opposed alike
in name and spirit to our
constitution
.
To
hinder , therefore , any such
encroach-
ments , the king is himself a part of the parliament
: and ,
as this is the reason of his being so , very properly there-
fore the share of legislation , which
the
constitution
has
placed in the crown , consists in
a
power of rejecting
rather than of resolving ; this being
sufficient to answer
the end proposed.
For we may apply to the royal nega-
tive in this instance , what Cicero observes
of the negative
of the Roman tribunes , that the crown has not any power
of doing wrong , but merely of preventing
wrong
from
being
done (c).
The crown
cannot of itself initiate
any
alterations
in the
present
established
law ; but it may
approve
or disapprove of the
alterations
suggested and
consented to by the two houses.
The legislative
therefore
cannot abridge the executive power of any rights which it
now has by law, without its own consent ; since the law
must
perpetually
stand
as it now does , unless
all
the
powers will
agree
to alter it.
And herein
consists one.
special
excellence of the English
government , that
the
parts of it mutually
check one another . In the legislature ,
the people are a check upon
the nobility , and the nobility
a check
upon
the
people ; by
the
mutual
privilege
of
rejecting or amending what the other has resolved : whilst
the sovereign is a check upon both , and may preserve the
executive power from encroachments .
But this executive
power is again
checked and kept within due bounds by
the two houses , through
the privilege
they have of in-
quiring into, impeaching , and punishing
the conduct (not
indeed of the
sovereign (d) ) , which
would
destroy his
constitutional
independence ;
but , (which

Thus every branch of our civil polity supports and is sup-
ported by, regulates and is regulated by the rest
for the
two houses naturally drawing in two directions of opposite
interest , and the prerogative in another still different , they
mutually
keep
each
other from exceeding
their
proper
limits ; while the whole is prevented from separation , and
artificially connected
together by the mixed nature of the
crown , which forms a part of the legislative
machine , and
is the sole executive magistrate .
Acting like three dis-
tinct powers in mechanics , they jointly impel the govern-
ment in a direction
different
from what either , acting by
itself,
would
have
done
;
but
at the
same
time
in a
direction
partaking of each ,
and formed
out of all ;
a
direction which
constitutes , as nearly
as may be , the true
line of liberty and political
well -being of the community .
Let us now
consider
these
constituent
parts
of the
sovereign
power ,
or parliament ,
each
separately .
The
sovereign ,
his
title,
duties ,
prerogatives ,
and
revenue
will
form the
subject -matter of the next and some sub-
sequent chapters , to which
we must
at present
merely
refer .
The next in order are the spiritual
lords .
These consist
of two archbishops ,
and
twenty -four
bishops
for Eng-
land (e).
To the lords spiritual
were added
four
bishops

Also , by the statute

the
num-
ber of lords
spiritual shall
not
be
increased
by the
creation
of the
bishopric
of Manchester , and when-
ever there shall be a vacancy by the
avoidance of any one of the sees of
Canterbury , York,
London ,

,
or of any
other see filled by the translation
of
a bishop
already
sitting, such
va-
cancy shall be supplied
by the issue
of a writ of summons to the bishop
elected to the same see ; but if the
vacancy be caused by the avoidance
of any other see, such vacancy shall
be supplied
by the issue of a writ of
summons to that bishop
who
shall
not have previously
become entitled
to such writ ; and no bishop elected
to any see, not being one of the five
sees above named , shall be entitled
to a writ of summons
unless in the
order
and
according
to the
con-
ditions
above prescribed .

on the part of Ireland
upon the union of that country with
Great Britain , and of these spiritual
peers , who sit by
rotation of sessions ,
an
archbishop
of the
church
in
Ireland is always one (ƒ).
The right
by which
the spiritual
lords
have since the
conquest
held
their
seats in
parliament
is
uncertain .
During Saxon times it seems
agreed
that
they sat there
in virtue of their ecclesiastical
office (g) , but some learned
writers
have affirmed that they sit there as holding
certain
ancient
baronies
under
the
crown :
for it is said that
William
the Conqueror
thought
proper
to
change the
spiritual
tenure
of frank-almoign
or free
alms ,
under
which the
bishops
held their lands
during
the
Saxon
government , into the feudal or Norman
tenure by barony ;
which subjected their
estates
to civil charges and assess-
ments , from which they were before exempt (h ) : and that
in right of succession
to those
baronies , which were un-
alienable
from their respective dignities , the bishops
and
abbots were allowed
their
seats in the house of lords (i).
Let this be as it may, the archbishops and bishops sitting
in
the
upper
house
solely in
that
capacity ,
although
" lords of parliament , ” are not in strictness " peers " (k).
Though the lords spiritual are in the eye of the law a
distinct estate from the lords
temporal , and are so distin-
guished in most of our acts of parliament , yet in practice
they are usually
blended
together
under the
one name
of " the lords ;"
they
intermix
in their
votes
;
and
a
majority
of votes
so
intermixed
decides
the
specific
question before the house.

have
argued (1)
very
cogently ,
that
the
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
are
now in
reality only
one
estate (m) : which
is unquestionably
true in every effec-
tual sense , though
the ancient
distinction
between them
still nominally
continues .
For if a bill should
pass their
house , there is no doubt of its validity, though every lord
spiritual
should vote against it ; of which
Selden (n) , and
Sir
Edward
Coke (0), give
instances :
as ,
on the
other
hand , I presume it would
be equally good, if the
lords
temporal
present were inferior
to the bishops in number ,
and every one of those temporal
lords
gave his vote to
reject the bill (p).
The lords temporal consist of all the peers of the realm
(the bishops not
being in strictness held to be such , but
merely
lords
of parliament
(9) )
by whatever
title of
nobility
distinguished
;
dukes ,
marquisses ,
earls , vis-
counts , or barons ; of which dignities
we shall speak more
hereafter .
Some of these sit by descent , as do all ancient
peers ; some by creation , as do all new made ones ; others
by election , as
do the
sixteen
peers , who represent
the
body of the
Scottish
nobility,
and
are elected
for
one
parliament
only , and the twenty -eight representative Irish
peers , who are elected for life.
The number
of the
peers
of the United Kingdom
is
indefinite , may be increased at will by the power of the

The

therefore the style of " lords spiri-

crown ,
and
is
by new
creations
gradually
increasing .
In the reign of Queen Anne , there was an instance
of
creating
no less than
twelve
peers
together ; in contem-
plation of which , in the reign of King George the First ,
a bill passed the house of lords , and was countenanced
by the
then
ministry, for limiting the number
of the
peerage .
This was thought
by some
to promise
a great
acquisition
to the constitution , by restraining
the
pre-
rogative
from
gaining
the
ascendant
in
that
august
assembly , by pouring in at pleasure an unlimited
number
of new created lords .
But the bill was ill relished
and
miscarried
in the
house of
commons ,
whose
leading
members were then
desirous to keep the
avenues
to the
other house as open and easy as possible .
So far
as regards
the Irish
peerage
the prerogative
of
the
crown was by the 4th
article
of the
Act of Union
restrained , for that article allows the creation of one Irish
peerage only in lieu of every three of such peerages
which
become extinct (r).
Should however the number of Irish
peers ,
exclusive
of
such
as
are
peers
of the
United
Kingdom , be reduced to one hundred , then one new Irish
peerage may be created by the crown whensoever
one of
such hundred
peerages
becomes
extinct or whensoever an
Irish
peer becomes
entitled to an hereditary
seat in par-
liament (8).
The
distinction
of rank and
honour
is
necessary in
every well-governed
state : in order to reward such
as are
eminent
for their services to the public, in a manner the
most desirable to individuals
, and yet without
burden to
the community (t) ; exciting
thereby ambition
and emu-
lation in others .
Emulation is a spring of action , which ,

THE PARLIAMENT.
however
dangerous
or
invidious
in a mere
republic
or
under
a despotic
sway, will certainly
be attended with
good
effects
under a free monarchy
; where
its
excesses
may be restrained
by that superior power from which
all
honour is derived .
Such a spirit, when nationally
diffused ,
gives life and vigour
to the community
; it sets
all the
wheels of government
in motion , which ,
under
a wise
regulator , may be directed to any beneficial purpose ; and
thereby
every individual
, whilst principally meaning
to
promote his own
ends, may be made subservient
to the
public
good .
A body of nobility is , in our mixed
and
compounded constitution , efficacious to support
the rights
of both the crown and the people , by forming
a barrier to
withstand
the
encroachments
of either .
It
creates
and
preserves
that gradual
scale of dignity which proceeds.
from
the peasant
to the prince ; rising like
a pyramid
from
a broad foundation , and diminishing
to a point
as
it rises .
It is this ascending and contracting
proportion
that
adds stability to
a government
; for when the
de-
parture is sudden from
one extreme
to another , we may
pronounce that condition of society to be precarious .
The
nobility therefore
are the pillars, which
are
reared from
among the
people ,
more
immediately
to
support
the
throne ; and , if that falls, they must be buried
under its
ruins .
Accordingly
, when in the seventeenth century the
commons
had
determined
to
extirpate
monarchy ,
they
also voted the house of lords to be useless
and dangerous .
Since , therefore , titles
of nobility are expedient
in the
state, it is also expedient
that their owners should form
an
independent
and separate branch
of the
legislature .
If they were confounded with the mass of the people , and
like them could only vote in electing representatives , their
privileges
would
soon
be borne down
and
overwhelmed
by the popular
torrent , which
would
effectually level all
distinctions .
It is highly necessary that the
body of
nobles
should
form
a
distinct
assembly ,

In a free
state
every man ,
who is
supposed a free agent , ought
to be in some
measure his
own
governor ; and
therefore , theoretically
, a branch
at
least of the legislative
power should
reside in the whole
body of the people.
And this power , when the territories.
of the state are small and its citizens easily known , should
be exercised by the people in their aggregate or collective
capacity , as was wisely ordained in the petty republics of
Greece , and the first rudiments of the Roman
state .
this will be highly inconvenient , when
the public
terri-
tory is
extended
to
any
considerable
degree ,
and
the
number
of citizens
is increased .
Thus
when , after the
social war , all the burghers
of Italy were admitted
free
citizens
of Rome , and
each
had a vote in the public
assemblies , it
became
impossible
to
distinguish
the
spurious
from
the
real
voter ,
and from that
time
all
elections and popular deliberations
grew tumultuous
and
disorderly
; which
paved the way for
Marius
and

Pompey
and Cæsar, to trample
on the
liberties
of their
country , and at last
to dissolve

by a number of separate districts ,
wherein all the voters are , or may be , distinguished

The
counties , therefore , have been represented by knights , elected

cities and boroughs
have
been represented by citizens and burgesses , chosen for the

when
elected

for the whole

For the end of his

parliament
is not particular , but
general : not
barely to
advantage his constituents , but to promote the interests
of the commonwealth
; to advise his sovereign (as appears
from the writ of summons (y) ) " de communi consilio super

et urgentibus , regem , statum , et

And
therefore
a member
is
not
bound
to
consult with, or take the advice of, his constituents
upon
any particular
point , unless he himself thinks it proper or
prudent so to do.
These
are

relating to parliament , united

The
power
and
jurisdiction
of
parliament ,
says
sir
Edward
Coke (c), is so transcendent
and
absolute , that
it cannot
be confined , either for causes
or persons within
any bounds .
And of this high court , he adds , it may be
truly
said , " si
antiquitatem spectes ,
est
vetustissima
; si
dignitatem , est honoratissima ; si jurisdictionem , est capac-
issima ."
It has sovereign and uncontrollable
powers in
the making ,

and

concerning

of all
possible
denominations , eccle-
siastical
or

or

minal : to parliament
a supreme authority
is intrusted by
the constitution
of these kingdoms .
All mischiefs
and
grievances , operations
and remedies , that
transcend the
ordinary
course of the laws , are within the
reach of this
extraordinary
tribunal (d).
It can regulate or new model
the succession
to the crown ; as was done in the reign of
Henry VIII . , and William III .
It
can
alter the
estab-

religion
of the land ;
as was done in a variety of
instances , in the reigns
of king Henry VIII . , and his
three children .
It can change and
create
afresh even the
constitution
of the
kingdom
and of parliaments
them-
selves ; as was done by the acts of union , and the several
statutes for triennial and septennial elections .
It can , in
short , do
everything
that is not

THE PARLIAMENT.
a figure
rather too bold , the omnipotence of parliament .
True
it
is , that what
the
parliament
does , no authority .
upon earth can undo .
So that it is a matter most essential
to the
liberties
of the kingdom , that
such
members be
delegated to this important
trust , as are most eminent for
their probity , their
fortitude , and their
knowledge ; for
it was a known apophthegm of the great
lord
treasurer
Burleigh, " that England could never be ruined
but by a
parliament
;" and , as
sir
Matthew Hale observes
(e),
this
being the highest
and
greatest
court
,
over which
none
other
can have jurisdiction
in
the
kingdom
,
if
by any
means
a
misgovernment
should
any way fall upon
it
,
the
subjects
of
this kingdom
are
left without
all manner
of
remedy
.
To the same purpose the president Montesquieu
,
though
I
trust
too
hastily
,
presages
(ƒ
),
that
as
Rome
,
Sparta
,
and Carthage have lost their liberty
and perished
,
so
the
constitution
of
England will
in
time
lose
its
liberty
,
will perish
:
it
will
perish
,
he
says
,
whenever
the legislative
power shall
become more corrupt
than the
executive
.
It
must be owned that Mr. Locke
(g
),
and other theo-
retical writers
,
have held
,
that
"
there remains still inhe-
rent
in
the people
a
supreme power
to
remove
or
alter
the legislative
,
when they find
the legislative
act contrary
to
the trust reposed
in
them
:
for when
such trust
is
abused
,
it
is
thereby forfeited
,
and devolves
to
those who
gave
it
."
Without
anticipating
what will
hereafter
be
said upon this subject
(
),
we must observe that
however
just Mr. Locke's
conclusion may
be
in
theory
,
legal
steps
cannot
be taken
for carrying
it
into
execution
,
for
the
devolution
of
power
,
to
the
people
at
large
,
if
literally
effected
,
would
include
in
it
a
dissolution
of
the whole
form
of
government
established

people

his
having

In 1768 he became

was duly returned

expelled him

Mr. Luttrell then became

were

sense , it lament ."
was maintained
that
parliament
could
assert new privi-
leges .
Accordingly
,
when , in
31
Henry
6 ,
a question
was
propounded
to the judges
by the
house of lords
concerning
their privileges , the
chief justice , sir John
Fortescue , in the name of his brethren , declared , " that
they ought
not to make answer to that
question : for it
hath not been used aforetime
that
the justices
should in
any way determine
the privileges
of the high court of
parliament .
For it is so high and mighty in its nature ,
that it may make
law
and that which
is
law , it may
make no law : and the determination
and knowledge of
that privilege
belongs to the lords of parliament
and not
to the justices " (x).
The primary
maxim
insisted
on by parliament
has on
some notable occasions been impugned .
It may be thus
stated
that
whatever
matter
arises
concerning
either
house
of parliament , ought
to be examined , discussed ,
and adjudged
in that
house to which it relates , and not
elsewhere (y).
For instance , the lords will not suffer the
commons
to interfere in settling
the election of a peer of
Scotland ; the commons will
not allow the lords
to judge
of the election
of a burgess , and
have more than
once
evinced
remarkable
jealousy
of any
interference
by the
upper house or by the superior
courts of law with their

asserted privileges ; for
example , in the famous
case
of
the Aylesbury
election (x) , and in that
of
Stockdale v.
Hansard (a).
(z) Ashby v. White , 2 Ld . Raym .
1105.
This was
an
action
by a
burgess of
Aylesbury
against
the
returning officers of the
borough ,
for
maliciously
refusing
to receive
his
vote for two
candidates , who ,
however , were elected .
A majority
of the
Court
of
Queen's
Bench
(contrary
to the
opinion
of Lord
Holt ) held
that the
action
would
not lie , on the ground , inter
alia ,
that it was in breach of the privi
leges of the
House
of
Commons .
This judgment
was reversed in the
House
of
Lords .
Consequent
on
these
proceedings
occurred
a cele-
brated
debate in the lower
house ,
and the passing
of
resolutions
in
assertion of the
exclusive
privilege
of the Commons
" to
examine
and
determine
all
matters
relating
to
the right of election
of their own
members ," and the
qualification
of
electors , and declaring
guilty of a
breach of privilege
any person who
should
presume
to
commence
or
prosecute
any action
which
might
bring the right of electors , or per-
sons elected to serve in parliament ,
to the
determination
of any
other
jurisdiction than that of the House
of Commons .
Further
legal
pro-
ceedings
having , in the face of the
above resolutions , been taken , and
a collision

took part with the Aylesbury
men ,
and

(a) In Stockdale v. Hansard, 9
A. & E. 1 ; 11 Id . 253, the
extent
to which the
courts
of justice
can
take cognisance of, or even control ,
the privileges
claimed by the House
of Commons
underwent
much dis-
cussion .
The circumstances of that
case were briefly as follows
: The
House
of Commons
ordered
a cer-
tain report to be printed , containing
matter
reflecting
upon
Stockdale ,
which, if printed
by any
private
person , would
have
been a libel.
For
this
publication
,
Stockdale
brought
an
action
against
Messrs .
Hansard , the printers
to the House
of Commons .
They pleaded that
the documents in question
had been
published
by them under the direc-
tion of the House of Commons , and
that the house had resolved that the
power
of publishing
such
of their
reports , votes ,
and
proceedings
as
they
thought
conducive
to
the
public
interest ,
was
an
essential
incident
to the
constitutional
func-
tions of parliament , more especially
to the Commons ' House
of Parlia-
ment as the
representative
portion
of it.
Upon
demurrer
to this plea ,
the Court of
Queen's
Bench was
called
upon
to
decide
whether
a
court of law is or is not
excluded
by the law of parliament
from the
consideration
of a privilege
claimed
by a formal
resolution
of the House
of Commons , and set up by their
printer as a justification
of an act
otherwise unlawful .
The court
de-
cided that
they were not precluded
from
determining
as to the validity
of the privilege .
In
consequence
of this decision , the statute
3 & 4
Vict . c. 9, was passed for the special
protection
of all persons publishing


ITS
PRIVILEGES
.
197
Privilege of parliament
was principally established , in
order to protect its members not only from being molested
by their fellow subjects , but from being oppressed
by the
power of the crown ; and it has been contended that if
the privileges of parliament
were ascertained the attain-
ment
of the objects
specified
could
not
be adequately
assured , nay, further , that it is competent to either house
to claim and assert by resolution
a new privilege .
Such a
doctrine
is fraught with danger
to the community .
No
declaration
of either house , said Lord Holt (b) , can bind
the subject or create any new privilege , for then it would
have the
force of
an act of parliament ,
and
bind
the
person and property of the subject , which
are free , unless
restrained
or limited
by the legislature
of the kingdom .
The lords and the
commons
respectively
are judges
of
their own privileges , but
they have not power to enlarge
nor to create them .
Some of the more notorious privileges
of the members
of either
house
are , privilege of speech
and of person .
As to the first , privilege
of speech , it is declared by the
statute
1 Will. & M. sess . 2 , c . 2 , as one of the liberties of
the people , "that the freedom of speech , and debates , or
proceedings in parliament , ought not to be impeached or
questioned in any court or place out of parliament ."
And
this freedom
of speech
is
particularly
demanded of the
sovereign in person , by the
speaker of the
house of
commons , at the opening of every new parliament .
The
privilege ,
so
far
as it
involves
immunity from
legal
liability ,
extends
only to
speeches
uttered
within
the
walls of parliament
(c) .
The
privilege
of person is an immunity
referable
to
very early times , for we find
in the laws of Edward
the
parliamentary
reports ,
votes,
or
other proceedings
by order of either
house of parliament
.

prorogation , and
forty days before the
next
appointed
meeting : which is now in effect
as long as the parliament
subsists , it seldom being
prorogued
for more than four-
score days at a time .
A member of the lower
house is
also protected before the first meeting and after the final
dissolution
of parliament
for a convenient
time sufficient
to allow of his coming from or returning
to any part of
the
kingdom (¿).
As to other privileges , which
obstruct
the ordinary
course of justice , they were restrained by the
statutes
12 Will . 3, c. 3 , 2 & 3 Ann . c. 18 , and
11 Geo. 2 ,
c. 24, and
were abolished
by statute
10
Geo . 3, c. 50,
which enacts, that
any suit may at any time be brought
against
any peer
or member of parliament , or any other
person
entitled
to privilege
of parliament
; which
shall
not
be impeached
or delayed
by pretence of any
such
privilege ; except
that
the person
of a member
of the
house of commons shall not thereby be subjected
to any
arrest or imprisonment .
Likewise
by force of the statutes
52 Geo . 3 , c. 144 , and
12 & 13 Vict . c. 106 , s . 77 (k) , a
bankrupt is incapable of sitting in the house of commons .
The only way by which courts of justice could anciently
take cognizance of privilege of parliament
was by writ of
privilege , in the
nature of a supersedeas , to deliver
the
party
out of custody when
arrested in a civil
suit (1).
For
when
a letter
was written
by the
speaker
to the
judges , to stay proceedings
against
a privileged
person ,
they rejected it as contrary to their oath of office (m ).
But
since the statute
12 Will . 3 , c. 3 , which
enacts
that
no
privileged
person shall
be subject to arrest or imprison-
ment , it has been
held
that
such arrest
is irregular
ab
initio,
and
that
the
party
may
be
discharged
upon
motion (n) in the court out of which the
process
issued .

observed

such writ of privilege , save
only in civil suits ; and
that
the
statute
1 Jac.
1 ,
c.
13 ,
and that of King William
(which
remedy
some
inconveniences
arising
from privi-
lege of
parliament )
speak only
of civil
actions .
And
therefore the claim of privilege
has been
usually guarded
with an exception as to the case of indictable
crimes (0) ;
or, as it has been frequently
expressed
, of treason, felony ,
and breach (or
surety) of the
peace (p).
Whereby it
seems
to have
been
understood
that
no
privilege
was
allowable
to members of parliament
in respect of any
crime whatsoever
for all crimes are treated by the law as
being contra pacem domini regis.
And instances have not
been wanting , wherein privileged
persons have been con-
victed of misdemeanors , and committed , or prosecuted to
outlawry ,
even
in the
middle
of
a
session (q) ;
which
proceeding
has
afterwards
received
the
sanction
and
approbation
of parliament (r).
To which
may be added ,
that
about a century ago, the
case of writing
and pub-
lishing
seditious
libels was resolved by both
houses
(s ) ,
not to be entitled
to privilege
(although
the
court
of
common pleas had otherwise decided ( t) ) ; and that the
reasons
upon which
that
case
proceeded
(u) ,
extended
equally to
every
indictable
offence .
So that
the chief, if
not the only , privilege of parliament , in such cases , seems
to be the right of receiving immediate
information
of the
imprisonment
or
detention
of
any
member ,
with
the
reason for which
he is
detained :
a practice which
has
been recognised
by temporary
statutes
suspending
the
habeas
corpus act (x) ; and providing
that no member of
either house shall
be detained till the matter of which he
stands
suspected
be first communicated

If a member of either house be attached for contempt
of court , it would
be for the house to consider , regard
being had
to the circumstances
of the
case , whether the
parliamentary
privilege of freedom from arrest should
be
asserted or be waived (y).
These are the general
heads of the laws
and customs
relating to parliament , considered
as one aggregate body.
We will next proceed to-
laws and
the house of
IV. The
laws
and customs
relating
to the house of IV. The
lords in particular .
These , if we exclude
their judicial customsof
capacity , which will
be more properly
treated of in the lords in par-
third and fourth books of these Commentaries , will
take
up but little of our time .
One privilege , which
by reason of
its
antiquity
may be
mentioned
,
is
that declared
by the charter
of
the forest

confirmed
in
parliament

viz
.,
that

may

in

,
kill one

in

of
the forester
if
he be present

or
on

if
he be absent
;
that he may not

right

are

to attend the house (a) though the judges alone are con-
sulted on points of law.
Another
privilege
is , that
every peer, by licence from
the crown (b), may make any other lord of parliament
his
proxy , to vote for him in his
absence (c) .
A privilege
which
a member of the other
house can by no means
have , as he is himself but a proxy for a multitude
of other
people (d ).
Each peer has also a right , by leave of the house, when
a vote
passes
contrary to his
sentiments , to
enter his
dissent on the journals of the house , with the reasons for
such dissent ; which is usually
styled his protest .
All bills likewise , that may in their
consequences
any
way affect the right of the peerage, are by the custom
of
parliament
to have their first rise and beginning
in the
house of peers , and to suffer no changes or amendments
in the house of commons , in whom nevertheless is vested
the power of rejecting them altogether .
One statute peculiarly
relative to the house of lords is
the
6 Ann . c. 23, which
regulates
the
election of the
sixteen
representative
peers
of North Britain , in conse-
quence of the twenty -second
and twenty -third articles of
the union ; and for that purpose prescribes the oaths , &c. ,
to be taken by the electors ; directs the mode of ballot-
ing ; prohibits
the peers
electing
from
being attended in
an
unusual
manner ;

arose a doubt in Nov.

the
proxies in that
parliament

the king's illness
? (1 Ld . Mountm .

Proxies
cannot be used in a
committee (Ib. 106).
A proxy can-
not sign a protest . If a peer after
appointing
a
proxy
appear
per .
sonally in parliament , his proxy is
revoked
and
annulled
(4 Inst . 13).
By the
orders
of the
house ,
no
proxy shall vote upon a question
of
guilty
or not guilty .
A spiritual
lord
shall
only
be
a
proxy for
spiritual
lords , and a temporal
lord

other matter

only the election , on pain of incurring
a pramunire (e).
The election of the Irish representative peers
is regu-
lated by the fourth article of the union (ƒ).
of V. The laws
V. The
peculiar
laws
and
customs of the
house
commons
relate principally to the raising
of taxes , and
the election of members to serve in parliament .
First, with regard
to
taxes : it is the ancient indis-
putable privilege
and right of the house of commons , that
all grants of subsidies or parliamentary
aids begin in their
house , and are first bestowed by them (g) ; although their
grants are not effectual to all intents and purposes , until
they have
the
assent of the
other two branches of the
legislature .
The general
reason
given
for this exclusive
privilege of the house of commons , is, that
the supplies
are raised
upon the body of the people , and therefore it is
proper that they alone should
have the right of taxing
themselves .
This
reason would
be unanswerable if the
commons taxed none but themselves : but it is notorious
that a very large share of property is in the possession of
the house of lords : that this property
is equally taxable ,
and taxed , as the property of the commons ; and therefore ,
the commons
not
being the sole persons taxed , this can-
not be the reason of their having the sole right of raising
and
modelling the
supply .
The
true
reason ,
arising
from the spirit
of our
constitution ,
seems
to
be this.
The
lords being
a permanent
hereditary
body , created
at pleasure
by the sovereign , are
supposed
more
liable
to be influenced
by the crown , and when
once
influenced
to continue
so , than the commons , who are a temporary
elective body , freely nominated
by the people.
It would
therefore
be extremely dangerous
to give the lords any
power of framing
new taxes for the subject : it is suffi-
cient
that they have a power of rejecting
them , if they

think the commons
too lavish or improvident
in
their
grants .
But
so
reasonably jealous
are the commons of
this valuable
privilege , that herein
they will
not
suffer
the other house to exert any power but that of rejecting ;
they will not permit the least alteration or amendment to
be made by the lords in the mode of taxing the people by
a money bill ; under which
appellation
is included
every
bill by which
money is directed
to be raised
upon the
subject ,
for
any
purpose
or in
any
shape
whatsoever ;
either for the exigencies
of government , and
collected
from the kingdom
in general ,
as the
land -tax ;
or for
private
benefit , and collected in any particular
district ,
as by turnpikes , parish rates , and the like.
And in bills
by which pecuniary burthens
are imposed upon the people
it is not competent to the lords to make any amendments
altering the intention of the commons with regard to the
amount ofthe rate or charge to be imposed , its duration ,
mode of assessment,
levy ,
collection ,
appropriation ,
or
management ,
or
the
persons
who
shall
pay ,
receive,
manage , or control it, or the limits within which it shall
be levied ( ).
Next with regard
to the elections of knights , citizens ,
burgesses , and
members
for the
universities , we
may
observe
that herein
consists the
exercise of the demo-
cratical part of our constitution
: for in a democracy there
can be no exercise of sovereignty but by suffrage , which is
the declaration
of the people's will .
In all
democracies
therefore it is of the utmost
importance
to regulate by
whom , and in what manner , the suffrages are to be given .
And the Athenians
were so justly jealous
of this
prero-
gative , that a stranger , who interfered
in the assemblies
of the
people, was punished by their
laws with death :
because such a man was esteemed
guilty of high treason ,
by usurping
those rights of sovereignty , to which he had

In England , where the people do not
debate in
a collective
body, but by representation , the
exercise of
this sovereignty consists in the choice of representatives .
The
laws
have
therefore
very
strictly
guarded
against
usurpation
or
abuse
of this
power , by many
salutary
provisions , which
may be reduced
to these three points ,

qualifications

cations of the elected .

; 2 , as regards electors.
knowledge
and mental
cultivation .
1. The
reason as-
signed for requiring
a property qualification
in voters
has
been to exclude such persons as
are in so needy and im-
poverished a condition
that
they are esteemed
to have no
will of their own. If these persons had votes , it has been
said, they would
be
tempted
to
dispose of them under
some undue influence or other .
This might give a great
landed
proprietor , an artful, or a wealthy man ,
a larger
share in elections than would
be consistent with general
liberty .
If it were
probable
that
every man would
give
his vote
freely
and without
influence
of any kind , then ,
upon the true
theory and genuine
principles
of liberty ,
every member of the community , however
poor , should
have a vote in electing those
delegates
, to whose charge is
committed
the disposal of his
property , his liberty, and
his life.
But since that can hardly be expected in persons
of indigent fortunes , or such as are under the immediate
dominion
of others , all popular
states
have been obliged
to establish
certain qualifications
; whereby some who are
suspected to have no will of their own, are excluded from
voting , in order to set those individuals
, whose wills may
be supposed
independent , more thoroughly
upon
a level
with each other.
Another argument
in favour of some property qualifi-
cation for exercising the franchise is that manhood suffrage
would
give a great , perhaps
a dangerous , preponderance
to the ignorant
over the educated classes , and might so

jeopardize in times of political excitement the stability
of
the commonwealth .
The
constitution
of suffrages
is indeed framed upon a
wiser
principle , with us , than
either of the
methods
of
voting , by centuries or by tribes , among the Romans .
In
the method by centuries , instituted
by Servius Tullius , it
was principally property , not
numbers , that
turned
the
scale : in the method by tribes , gradually
introduced
by
the tribunes
of the people, numbers
only were regarded ,
and property
was
entirely
overlooked .
Hence the laws
passed by the
former
method
had usually
too great
a
tendency to aggrandize the patricians
or rich nobles ; and
those by the latter had too much of a levelling
principle .
Our constitution
has
endeavoured to
steer
between
the
two extremes by requiring ,
1 , a moderate qualification
in
property
for the franchise
; or, 2, a degree
of knowledge
and
mental
cultivation ,
as
vouched
for
instance
by a
certain academical status in the voter.
Nor is comparative
wealth , or property , entirely disregarded
in elections ; for
though
the richest
man has only one vote at
one place ,
yet if his
property
be at all
diffused , he has probably a
right to vote at more places than one , and therefore may
be
said to have several representatives .
Such
are
the
reasons urged in favour
of the principle
upon which
our
representative
system
is at present founded .
An account
of the existing
state of the franchise is necessarily , owing
to
projected
changes , reserved for
the Appendix (1), to
which the reader is likewise referred for an account of the
proceedings at an election .

THE
PARLIAMENT.
VI. The
method of
making
laws.
VI. I proceed , sixthly , to the method of making
laws
;
which
is
much
the
same in both
houses : and I shall
touch it very briefly , beginning
in the house of commons .
But first I must
premise , that
for
dispatch of business
each house of parliament
has its speaker.
The speaker
of the house of lords , whose office is to preside there , and
manage the formality
of business , is the lord chancellor ,
or keeper of the king's great seal , or in his absence
one of
the deputy -speakers
appointed by the king's commission :
and , if none such be present , the house of lords may elect
a
speaker pro
tempore .
The
speaker of the
house of
commons is chosen by the house ; but
must be approved
by the crown (d).
And herein the usage of the two houses
differs , that the speaker of the house of commons cannot
give
his
opinion
or
argue any
question in the house ;
though he may vote and assign reasons for his vote if the
numbers pro and
con.
are
equal.
Moreover
when
the
house of commons resolves itself into a committee , the
chairman of the committee (who in the lords is appointed
at the commencement of each session , and in the commons
is in general the chairman of the committee of ways and
means) presides , and then the speaker may for the time
speak and vote as any ordinary member .
The speaker of
the upper house may, if a lord of parliament , address
it ,
but
he has no casting vote, his vote being
counted with
which
has
been
made to
exclude
lawyers
from
parliament .
In the
47 Edw. 3, the clause , known by
the
name of the
nolumus
clause ,
was first inserted in the writs
; and
on subsequent
occasions
attempts
have been made to put it into force .
It
ran
thus : "Nolumus
autem
quod tu aut aliquis alius vicecomes
regni
nostri
aut apprenticius
aut
aliquis
alius
homo
ad
legem
aliqualiter sit
electus."
Rogers ,
Elect. 10th ed. 201 n. (2).
In the year
1649, a motion
was
made to exclude lawyers from the
parliament , by enforcing the nolu-
mus
clause ,
and
the
speech
of
Whitelocke
, in opposition
thereto ,
contains
much
curious
information
on the subject .

approval
has not been
withheld since the

case of an equality of
votes , the rule is , semper præsumitur pro negante (e).
In each house the act of the majority binds the whole ;
and this majority
is declared by votes openly and publicly
given
not
privately
or by ballot .
The
latter
method
may
be
serviceable in
some
assemblages ,
to
prevent
intrigues and unconstitutional
combinations , but
cannot
possibly
be practised
in the
house of commons ,
where
every member's
conduct is subject
to the future
censure
of his
constituents , and therefore
should
be openly sub-
mitted to their inspection .

made to the
house , without
any petition , or is founded
upon a resolution , or in the upper
house is brought in
without
leave.
Formerly, all
bills were drawn
in the
form of petitions from the commons , which were entered
upon the parliament
rolls with the king's answer there-
unto subjoined
; not in any settled form of words , but as
the
circumstances
of the
case
required (g) ; and
at the
end of each parliament
the judges drew the petitions
and
the answers to them into the form of a statute , which
was
entered
on
the
statute
rolls.
In
the
reign
of
Henry V. , to prevent mistakes and abuses (h) , the statutes
(g) See, for instance , the articuli
cleri , 9 Edw. 2.
(h) So
early
as
the
reign
of
Edward II. laws
had
found their
way on to the statute -roll of which
one
branch
or other of the
legisla-
ture afterwards
complained as being
without, or even against , their con-
sent .
In
1322 (15 Edw. 2) an ex-
plicit declaration , commonly
called
the Revocation
of Ordinances , was
made by statute of the necessity for
the uncontrolled
consent of the king
and
the three
estates to every law
and
ordinance .
It declares
that
"all matters
to be established for
the estate of our lord the king, and
of his
heirs , and
for the estate of
the realm , and of the
people , shall
be treated , accorded , and established
in parliament , by our lord the king,
and by the
assent of the
prelates ,
earls ,
and
barons ,
and
the
com-
monalty
of the realm , according
as
it hath been heretofore accustomed ."
Notwithstanding
this statutory
de-
claration ,
laws
were
still promul-
gated of which the
commons
had
not
approved ,
or which they
had
actually
rejected .
And against this
practice the commons remonstrated :
-
temp. Edw. 3, and in the Petition of
Right (anno 5 Rich. 2), which
states
that "it had ever been their liberty
and
freedom
that
there
should
no
statute or law be made , unless they
gave
thereto
their assent ; — that
they are, and
have ever been, part
of the king's
parliament , and be as
well assenters as petitioners ."
The
commons
then
petition
the king
that from
that
time
forward ,
on
complaint
from
them
of any
mis-
chief asking remedy thereof by their
speaker , or by
petition
written ,
there never should be any law made
thereon
and
engrossed
as
statute ,
nor any
additions , diminutions
, or
any manner of term or terms made
in the
same, whereby it should
be
changed from the intent and mean-
ing asked by the
speaker's
mouth
or the petitions
aforesaid , without
the assent of the said commons . To
this the king of his grace
especial
granted ,
that
from
thenceforth
nothing
should
be
enacted to the
petitions
of his
commons
that be
contrary
to their asking ,
whereby
they should be bound without their
own assent.

were drawn up by the judges
before
the end of the par-
liament ; and , in the
reign of Henry VI. , bills in the
form of acts , according to the modern custom , were first
introduced
.
The
enacting
words inserted
in an
act of
parliament
expressing the consent of the three branches
of the legislature
have much varied (i) ; the form , how-
ever, now used is as follows : " be it enacted by the king's
most

majesty , by and with the advice and con-
sent of the lords spiritual
and temporal
and commons in

thing occurs that is dubious , or necessary
to be settled by
the parliament
itself, such especially as the precise date
of times , the nature and amount of penalties , or of sums
of money to be raised .
In the house of lords , if the bill
begins
there , it is (when of a private nature ) sometimes
-as in the case of an estate bill-referred to two of the
judges , to examine
and
report
the
state of the facts
alleged , to see that all necessary parties
consent
to its
provisions , and
to
settle in it
points
of technical
pro-
priety (k).
This is
read a first time , and
after
a con-
venient
interval
a second time .
The introduction
of the
bill may be originally opposed , as the bill itself may be
at either of the readings ; and , if the opposition
succeeds ,
the bill must
be dropped
for
that
session
:
as it must

THE
PARLIAMENT.
The com-
mittee.
Proceedings
in
After the second reading the bill is committed , that is ,
referred to
a committee , which
is either
selected
by the
house, or else , upon
a bill of consequence
, the house re-
solves
itself into a committee
of the
whole
house .
A
committee of the whole house is composed
of every mem-
ber ; and , to form it, the speaker quits
the chair (another
member
being
appointed
chairman ) , and
may sit and
debate
as
a private
member .
In these committees the
bill is debated clause by clause, amendments
made, the
blanks
or
italics
filled
up ,
and
sometimes the
bill is
entirely new-modelled .
After it has gone through com-
mittee , the chairman
reports it to the house with such
amendments as the committee have made in it ; and then
the house reconsiders the whole bill again , and the ques-
tion is repeatedly put upon every clause and amendment .
When the house has
agreed
or disagreed to the amend-
ments of the
committee ,
and
sometimes
added
new
amendments of its
own , the bill was formerly
engrossed ,
but is now reprinted in its amended form .
Afterwards
the motion
for the third reading of the bill
is made, though , should material amendments even at this
advanced stage be needed
in it, the usual course
is to dis-
charge the order
for the third reading in order that the
bill may be recommitted
and the necessary amendments
be made in it.
The
speaker then
puts the question that
this bill do pass , and if this
is
agreed
to, the title of it is
settled ; which used to be a general
one
for all the acts
passed in the session , till in the first year of Henry VIII . a
distinct title was used for each chapter .
After this , the bill
is sent to the lords by a clerk of the house of commons .
The bill passes through the same forms in the upper as
hotse upper in the lower house,
and , if rejected,
no more notice is
taken of the matter , but it passes
sub silentio , to prevent
unbecoming
altercations .
If the bill is agreed to, the
lords
send
a message to the
commons
that they
have
agreed to the same : and the bill remains with the lords
if they
have made
no
amendment to it.
But if any


METHOD
OF
MAKING
LAWS .
215
amendments are made, such amendments
are sent down
with the bill, to receive the concurrence of the commons .
If the commons disagree to , and the lords insist upon , the
amendments , a conference usually follows
between mem-
bers deputed
from
each
house ; who
for
the most part
settle
and
adjust
the
difference ,
but , if
both
houses
remain
inflexible , the bill is dropped . If the commons.
agree to the amendments , the bill is
sent back to the
lords with a message
to acquaint them therewith .
The
same forms
are observed , mutatis mutandis , when the bill
begins in the house of lords .
But , when an act of grace
or pardon
is passed , it is first signed by the
sovereign ,
and then read
once
only in each house, without amend-
ment ( ).
And
when
both
houses have done with any
bill, it is always deposited in the house of peers , to await
the royal
assent : except in the case of a bill of supply ,
which after receiving
the
concurrence of the lords is sent
back to the house of commons (m).
assent.
The royal
assent may be given
in two
ways :
1. In The royal
person ; when the sovereign
comes
in regal
state to the
house of peers , and , sending for the commons to the bar ,
the titles of all the bills that have
passed
both houses are
read ; and the king's answer
is declared by the clerk of
the parliament
in Norman -French : a badge , it must be
owned (now the only
one remaining ) , of conquest ; and
which one could wish to see fall into total oblivion , unless
it be reserved as a solemn memento to remind us that our
liberties
are
mortal ,
having
once been destroyed by a
foreign force. If the king
consents to a public bill, the
clerk
usually
declares
, " le roy (or la reyne )
le
veut ," the
king
(or
queen) wills it so to be ; if to a private
bill ,
'soit fait comme il est desiré," be it as it is desired . If
the king refuses his assent, it is in the gentle language
of " le roy (or la reyne ) s'avisera " ( n) , the king (or queen )
will advise upon it.
When a bill of supply is passed , it is

carried up and presented to the sovereign by the
speaker
of the house of commons (o) ; and the royal assent is thus
expressed, " le roy (or la reyne) remercie
ses bons
sujets ,
accepte
leur
benevolence ,
et ainsi
le veut,"
the king (or
queen) thanks
his
loyal subjects , accepts
their
benevo-
lence , and wills it so to be .
In
case
of an act of grace ,
which
originally
proceeds
from
the
crown , and
has
the
royal assent in the first
stage of it, the clerk of the par-
liament
thus pronounced (p) the gratitude of the subject ;
" les prelats , seigneurs ,
et
communes , en
ce present parle-
ment assemblés au nom de touts vos autres
sujets , remercient
tres humblement
votre majesté , et prient à Dieu
vous donner
en santé bonne vie et longue ; " the prelates , lords , and com-
mons , in this present parliament
assembled , in the name
of all
your
other
subjects,
most
humbly
thank
your
majesty , and pray
to God
to grant
you in health
and
wealth long to live.
2. By the statute
33
Hen .
8 , c.
21 , the king may give his assent by letters patent under
his great
seal, signed with his hand , and notified in his
absence
to both houses assembled together in the upper
house.
This
course
is usually
adopted when
the
royal
assent is given
to a bill during the
continuance of the
session.
When the bill has received the royal assent in
either of these ways , it is then , and not before, a statute
or act of parliament .
And if no other day be specified ,
comes
into operation from the
day on which it receives
the royal assent, indorsed
upon it by the
clerk or clerk-
assistant of the parliaments (q) .

METHOD
OF
MAKING
LAWS .
217
This statute or act, consisting since 1849 of the authen-
ticated vellum
print , is preserved in the
house of lords
among the records of the kingdom
;
there needing no
formal promulgation
to give it the force of a law , as was
necessary by the civil law with regard to the emperor's
edicts , because
every man in England is , in judgment
of
law, party to making
an act of parliament , being
present
thereat by his representatives .
Formerly, indeed , before
the invention
of printing, the statute law was published
by the sheriff of every county ; the king's writ being sent
to him at the end of every session , together with a tran-
script of all the acts made at that session , commanding
him, “ ut statuta illa ,
et
omnes articulos in
eisdem
con-
tentos , in singulis
locis ubi expedire viderit , publicè pro-
clamari,
et firmiter
teneri et observari faciat."
And the
usage was to proclaim them at his county court , and there
to keep them , that whoever
would
might read or take
copies thereof ; which
custom continued till the reign of
Henry VII. (r).
In lieu of being thus promulgated , the
statutes (with the exception of some private acts ) are now
printed by the Queen's printer .
An act of parliament
is thus
made by an exercise of
the highest
authority
which this kingdom
acknowledges
upon
earth (s).
It has
power to bind every subject in
the land, and the
dominions
thereunto
belonging
; nay ,
even the sovereign , if particularly named therein .
And a
statute thus made cannot be altered , amended
, dispensed
with , suspended, or repealed , but in the like forms
and
by the like authority of parliament : for it is a maxim in
law , that it requires
the
same strength to dissolve as to
create an obligation .
It is true it was formerly held that
the sovereign might in many cases
dispense with penal
Geo. 3, c. 106, when a bill for con-
tinuing expiring acts shall not have
passed before such
acts
expire , the
bill, when
passed
into
a law, shall
have effect from the date of the ex-
piration
of the
act intended
to be
continued .

dissolved .
An adjournment
is no more than
a continuance of the
session from one day to another , as the word itself signi-
fies
and this is
done by the authority
of
each
house
separately every day ; and sometimes for a fortnight or a
month together , as at Christmas
or Easter , or upon other
particular
occasions.
But the adjournment of one house
is
no
adjournment
of the
other (v).
It has
also been
usual , when the sovereign's
pleasure has been signified ,
that
both
or either
of the
houses should
adjourn
to a
certain
day, to obey the royal pleasure
so signified , and
to adjourn
accordingly (x) .
Otherwise ,
besides
the in-
decorum
of
a
refusal ,
a prorogation
would
assuredly
follow
which
would
often be very inconvenient
to both
public
and
private
business .
For
prorogation
puts
an
end to the session ; and then such bills as are only begun
and not perfected , must be resumed
de
novo (if at all) in
a subsequent session ; whereas , after an adjournment , all
things continue in the same state as at the
time of the
adjournment
made , and may be proceeded
on without any
fresh commencement .
It has been enacted (y) that when
both houses of parliament
stand adjourned for more than
fourteen days, a proclamation
may issue from the crown

HOW

for the
meeting
of parliament on a day not
less than
fourteen days from the date of the proclamation .
A prorogation
is the continuance

Prorogation.
from
one session
to
another , as
an adjournment
is the
continuation
of the
session from
day to
day.
This is
done by the royal
authority , expressed either by the lord
chancellor in the
royal
presence
, or by writ under
the
great seal (z) , or by commission
from
the crown .
Both
houses
are necessarily prorogued at the same time ; it not
being a prorogation
of the
house of lords , or commons ,
but of the
parliament .
The session
is never understood
to be at an end until
a prorogation
; though , unless some
act be passed
or
some
judgment
given
in parliament , it
is in truth no session at all (a) .
And formerly the usage
was , for the king to give the royal assent to all such bills
as he approved , at the end of every session , and then to
prorogue
the
parliament
; though
sometimes only for a
day or two (b) ; after which
all business then
depending
in the houses was to be begun
again .
Which
custom
obtained so strongly , that it once became
a question (c),
whether giving the royal assent to a single bill did not of
course
put an end to the
session.
And , though
it was
then
resolved in
the
negative ,
yet the
notion
was
SO
deeply rooted, that the statute 1 Car .
1 , c. 7, was passed
to declare , that the king's
assent
to that and some other
acts
should
not put an end to the
session ;
and ,
even
(2) When it is intended
that par-
liament
about
to
assemble
shall
meet for the dispatch of business on
the day to which it is prorogued ,
notice of such intention
is given by
proclamation
.
But
when
it
is
intended
that a parliament
shall
not
meet
for the dispatch of busi-
ness, it is prorogued
to another
day
by a writ of prorogation .
Never-
theless , upon the day on which the
writs of summons
are
returnable ,
the members
of the House of Com-
mons who attend
assemble (without
entering
their
own
house , or wait-
ing for a message) in the House
of
Lords ,
when
the lord
chancellor
reads the writ of prorogation , and
declares parliament
to be prorogued
accordingly .

220
THE
PARLIAMENT
.
Dissolution.
so late
as the reign
of
Charles II. ,
we find
a
proviso
frequently
tacked to a bill (d) , that
his majesty's assent
thereto should not
determine
the session of parliament .
But it now seems
to be allowed , that a prorogation
must
be
expressly
made , in order
to
determine
the
session .
And , by 37 Geo . 3 , c. 127 , and 39 & 40 Geo . 3 , c. 14 , the
sovereign
can summon
a prorogued
parliament
to meet
for the dispatch
of business
on
any day not
less than
fourteen
days from the date of the
proclamation , not-
withstanding
any previous prorogation
to a more distant
day.
A dissolution
is the
civil
death of the
parliament
;
and this
may
be
effected
in
three
ways :
1.
By the
sovereign's will, expressed
either in person or by procla-
mation .
For ,
as
the
sovereign
has
the
sole
right
of
convening parliament , so also it is
a branch of the royal
prerogative , that
he may (whenever he
pleases ) prorogue
the parliament
for
a time , or put a final period
to its
existence .
If no power
could
prorogue
or
dissolve
a
parliament
but
itself, it might
happen to
become
per-
petual .
And this would
be extremely
dangerous , if at
any time it should attempt to encroach upon the executive :
as
was
fatally
experienced
by king
Charles I.;
who ,
having
unadvisedly passed an act to continue the parlia-
ment then in being till such time as it should
please
to
dissolve
itself, at last fell
a sacrifice to that inordinate
power , which he himself had consented
to give them .
It
is therefore extremely necessary
that the crown should
be
empowered to regulate
the duration of these assemblies ,
under the limitations
which
the English constitution
has
prescribed
so that , on the one hand they may frequently
and regularly
come
together for the dispatch of business ,
and
redress of grievances ; and may not , on the other ,
even with the
consent of the
crown , be continued
to an
inconvenient
or unconstitutional
length .

2. A parliament
may be dissolved by the demise of the
This
dissolution
formerly happened immediately
upon the death of the reigning
sovereign : for he being
considered in law as the head of the parliament (caput,
principium, etfinis ), that failing, the whole body was held
to be extinct .
But calling a new parliament
immediately
on the inauguration
of the
successor
being
found
incon-
venient , and dangers being
apprehended from
having
no
parliament
in being
in
case of a disputed
succession
, it
was
enacted
by the
statutes
7 & 8 Will . 3 , c. 15 , and
6
Ann . c. 7 , that the parliament in being should continue for
six months
after
the death of any king or queen , unless
sooner
prorogued
or
dissolved by the
successor
that if
the parliament
be , at the time of the sovereign's death ,
separated
by adjournment
or prorogation , it should not-
withstanding
assemble
immediately
:
and
that , if
no
parliament
be then in being , the
members
of the last
parliament
should
assemble, and be again
a parliament .
This
last
clause,
however , was repealed
by
statute
37
Geo . 3, c. 127 , which in lieu of it enacted that in case
of
the
demise of the
crown
between
the
dissolution
of parliament
and
the
day appointed
by the writs of
summons
previously issued, for assembling
a new parlia-
ment , the last
preceding
parliament
shall
immediately
convene
and
sit
and
continue
for six
months
unless
sooner prorogued or dissolved by the successor
; and that
in case of the demise of the
crown
on or after
the day
appointed
as
aforesaid for the assembling
a new parlia-
ment , but before it has actually met and sat, then such
new parliament
shall
immediately
convene and sit and
may continue
sitting for six months
unless
sooner
pro-
rogued or dissolved by the successor .
3. Lastly , a parliament
may be dissolved
or expire by
efflux of time .
For if either
the
legislative
body were
perpetual ; or might
last for the life of the sovereign who
convened them , as formerly
; and were so to be supplied ,
by occasionally filling the vacancies with new representa-

legislative
assembly also, which
is sure to be separated
again (whereby
its
members will
themselves
become
private men , and subject
to the full
extent
of the laws
which they have enacted
for others ) , will think themselves
bound , in interest as well as duty , to make only such laws
as are good .
The utmost
extent
of time that the same
parliament
was allowed to sit by statute 6 Will. & M. c. 2 ,
was three years ; after the expiration
of which , reckoning
from the return of the first summons , the parliament was
to have no longer
continuance .
But by the statute
1
Geo . 1 , st . 2 , c. 38 , (in order , professedly , to prevent the
great and continued
expenses of frequent
elections , and
the violent
heats and animosities
consequent thereupon ,
and for the
peace
and security of the government
then
just
recovering
from the
late rehellion ) this term
was
prolonged to seven
years : and , what alone is an instance.
of the vast authority of parliament , the very same house ,
that
was
chosen
for
three
years ,
enacted
its
own con-
tinuance
for
seven .
So that,
as
our
constitution
now
stands , the
parliament
must
expire ,
or
die ' a
natural
death , at the
end of every seventh year from the day of
meeting ; if not
sooner dissolved , as usually happens , by
the royal prerogative .

of

power ;
as
is declared
by statute
1
Mar.
st. 3 , c.
1 .
The executive power of the English nation being vested
in a single person , by the general
consent of the people,
the evidence of which general
consent is long and imme-
morial usage , it
became
necessary to the freedom
and
peace of the state, that a rule should be laid down , uniform ,
universal , and
permanent
;
in
order to mark out with
precision , who is that
single
person , to whom
are com-
mitted (in subservience to the law of the land ) the
care
and protection of the community
; and to whom , in return ,
the duty and allegiance of every individual
are due.
It is
of the highest importance to the public tranquillity, and to
the consciences of private
men , that this rule
should
be
clear and indisputable
; and our constitution
has not left
us in the dark
upon
this
material
occasion .
It will
therefore be my endeavour in this chapter to trace out the
constitutional
doctrine of the royal
succession, with that
freedom and regard to truth, yet mixed with that respect ,
which the
principles
of liberty
and the dignity of the
subject under our notice may require .
The grand
fundamental
maxim
upon
which

be this : that the crown is,

possess
the crown of England
by a right
like
theirs ,
immediately
derived from
heaven .
The
hereditary right
which the laws of England acknowledge , owes its origin
to the founders of our constitution , and to them only .
It
has no relation to, nor depends upon , the civil laws of the
Jews , the Greeks , the Romans , or any other nation
upon
earth
the municipal
laws of one society having
no con-
nexion with , or influence upon , the fundamental
polity of
another .
The founders
of our English
monarchy might
perhaps , if they had
thought
proper , have made it
an
elective monarchy : but they rather
chose , and upon good
reason, to establish originally a succession
by inheritance .
This
has
been
acquiesced in by general
consent ;
and
ripened by degrees
into common law : the very same title
that every private man has to his own estate .
Lands
are
not naturally descendible any more than thrones : but the
law has thought proper , for the benefit and peace
of the
public , to favour hereditary succession in the one as well
as in the other.
It must
be owned , an elective monarchy
seems
to be
the most obvious , and best suited
of any to the rational
principles
of government , and the
freedom
of human
nature
and accordingly we find from history that , in the
infancy
and
first rudiments
of almost
every state , the
leader,
chief magistrate ,
or
prince ,
has
usually
been
elective .
And , if the individuals
who compose
that state
could always continue true to first principles , uninfluenced
by passion
or prejudice ,
unassailed
by corruption ,
and
unawed by violence , elective succession were as much to
be desired in a kingdom , as in other inferior communities .
The best , the wisest , and the bravest man would
then be
sure of receiving
that crown , which
his endowments
have
merited ; and the
sense of an unbiassed
majority
would
be dutifully acquiesced in by the few who were of different
opinions .
But
history
and observation will inform
us,
that elections of every kind (in the present state of human
nature ) are too
frequently
brought
about
by influence ,

sameas of
landed
partiality ,
and
artifice :
and ,
even
where
the
case
is
otherwise , these
practices will be often
suspected
, and as
constantly
charged
upon the
successful , by a
splenetic
disappointed
minority .
This is
an
evil
to
which
all
societies
are
liable ;
as
well
those
of
a private
and
domestic
kind ,
as the great
community
of the public ,
which regulates and includes the rest.
But in the former
there is this
advantage ; that such
suspicions , if false ,
proceed no farther
than
jealousies
and
murmurs , which
time will effectually
suppress
; and , if true , the injustice
may be remedied by legal means, by an appeal to those
tribunals
to
which
every
member
of
society
has (by
becoming
such ) virtually engaged to submit .
Whereas
in the great and independent
society, which
every nation
composes , there is no superior to resort to but the law of
nature ; no method
to
redress
the infringements
of that
law but the actual exertion of private force.
As therefore
between two nations , complaining
of mutual
injuries , the
quarrel
can only be decided
by the law of arms ;
so in
one and the same nation , when the fundamental
principles
of their common union
are supposed to be invaded , and
more
especially
when
the
appointment
of their
chief
magistrate
is alleged to be unduly made, the only tribunal
to which the complainants
can appeal, is that of the God
of battles ; the
only process by which
the appeal can be
carried on is that of a civil and intestine war .
An here-
ditary
succession
to the crown , established
in
this
and
most other countries , is calculated to prevent that periodical
blood -shed
and misery , which
the history of ancient im-
perial Rome
and the more modern experience of Poland
and
Germany ,
may
show
us
are the
consequences
of
elective kingdoms .

secondly ,
as
to the
particular
mode of in-
nearly the
heritance , it in general
corresponds with the feudal path
of descents , chalked out by the common law in succession
to landed
estates ; yet with
one or two material
excep-
tions .
Like
estates , the
crown will
descend
lineally to
estates.

Thus
the issue of the reigning
monarch ;
as it did from
king
John to Richard II. , through
a regular
pedigree of six
lineal
generations .
As in
common
descents ,
the pre-
ference of males to females , and the right of primogeni-
ture among
the
males ,
are strictly adhered
to.
Edward
V.
succeeded
to the
crown
in
preference
to
Richard
his
younger
brother ,
and
Elizabeth
his
elder
sister.
Like
lands
or tenements , the crown , on failure
of the male line , descends to the issue female ; according
to the ancient British
custom
alluded
to by Tacitus (a).
Thus
Mary I. succeeded
to Edward VI. , and the line of
Margaret
queen
of Scots , the
daughter
of Henry VII. ,
succeeded
on failure of the line of Henry VIII . his son .
But among the females , the crown descends by right of
primogeniture
to the eldest daughter only and her issue ;
and not , as in common inheritances , to all the
daughters
at once ; the evident necessity of a sole succession to the
throne
having
occasioned the
royal
law of descents
to
depart
from the common law in this
respect ; and there-
fore queen Mary , on the death of her brother , succeeded
to the crown alone , and not jointly or in partnership
with
her sister Elizabeth
.
Again ; the doctrine of representa-
tion prevails
in the descent of the
crown , as it
does in
other inheritances
; whereby the lineal descendants of any
person deceased
stand in the same place as their ancestor ,
if living , would
have done.
Thus
Richard II. succeeded
his grandfather
Edward III . , in right of his
father the
black
prince ; to
the
exclusion
of all his
uncles ,
his
grandfather's younger children .
Lastly , on failure of lineal
descendants
, the crown goes to the next collateral relations
of the late king ;
provided
they
are lineally
descended
from the blood -royal , that is , from that royal stock which
originally
acquired the crown .
Thus
Henry I. succeeded
to William II. , John
to
Richard
I. ,

who
was then the
only regal

And herein
there is no
objection (such as in the
case of land existed prior to the
statute 3 & 4 Will . 4 , c. 106 , s . 5) to the succession of a
brother , an uncle , or other collateral
relation , of the half
blood ; that
is , where the relationship
proceeds
not from
the same couple of ancestors (which constitutes a kinsman
of the whole
blood ) but
from a single ancestor only ; as
when two persons are derived from the same father , and
not from the same mother , or vice versa : provided only,
that the one ancestor, from whom
both are descended
, be
that from whose veins the
blood -royal is communicated
to each .
Thus
Mary I.
inherited
to Edward VI. ,
and
Elizabeth inherited
to Mary ( b) ; all children of the
same
father , king Henry VIII . , but all by different mothers .
3. The doctrine of hereditary right by no means implies
an indefeasible
right to the throne .
No man will assert
this who has considered
our laws , constitution , and his-
tory , without
prejudice , and with any degree of attention .
It is unquestionably
in the breast of the supreme legisla-
tive authority
of this kingdom , the
sovereign
and both
houses of
parliament , to
defeat
this
hereditary
right ;
and, by particular
entails , limitations
and provisions , to
exclude the
immediate
heir , and vest the inheritance in
any one else .
This is strictly
consonant
to our laws
and
constitution
;
as may be gathered from the expression
so
frequently
used
in
our
statute
book , of the " king's
majesty , his heirs , and
successors
.
In which we may
observe , that as the word
" heirs " necessarily implies an
inheritance
or hereditary
right , generally
subsisting
in
the royal
person ;
so the word
" successors ,"
distinctly
taken , must
imply that this inheritance
may sometimes
be broken
through ; or , that there may be a successor
,
without
being the heir , of the sovereign .
And this
is
so
extremely reasonable, that without
such a power , lodged

For , let
us barely suppose
so melancholy
a case ,

should be a lunatic , an idiot , or otherwise inca-
pable of reigning

the condition
of
the
nation

It
is therefore necessary that this
power should
be lodged
somewhere : and yet the inheritance and regal
dignity would
be very
precarious
indeed , if this
power
were expressly and avowedly lodged in the hands of the
subject only , to be exerted whenever prejudice , caprice, or
discontent should happen to take the lead .
Consequently
it can no where be so properly lodged as in the two houses
of parliament , by and with the
consent of the reigning
sovereign ; who , it is not to be
supposed
, will
agree
to
any thing improperly
prejudicial
to the rights of his own
descendants .

And therefore , however acquired , it becomes
in
him absolutely hereditary , unless by the rules of the limi-
tation it is
otherwise
ordered
and
determined .
In the
same manner as landed estates
are by the law hereditary ,
or descendible to the heirs
of the owner ; but still there
exists a power , by which the property of those lands may
be transferred
to another
person.
If this
transfer
be
made simply and absolutely , the lands will be hereditary
in the new owner , and descend
to his heir at law ; but if
the transfer
be clogged with any limitations
, conditions ,
or entails , the lands
must
descend in that channel ,
so
limited
and prescribed , and no other .
In these four
points
consists the
constitutional
notion
succession of
hereditary
right to the throne ; which
will
be still
further elucidated ,
and made clear beyond all dispute ,
from
a short
historical
view of the
successions to the
crown of England , the doctrines of our
ancient lawyers ,
and the several acts of parliament
that have from time to
time been made to create , to declare, to confirm , to limit ,
or to bar the hereditary title to the throne .
And in the
pursuit of this inquiry we shall
find , that from the days
of Egbert, the first
sole
monarch
of this kingdom , even
to the present , the four cardinal maxims
above mentioned
have ever been
held
constitutional
canons of succession .
It is true , the succession
, through fraud , or force, or some-
times through necessity , when in hostile times the crown
descended
on a minor or the like, has been very frequently
suspended
; but it has generally
at last returned , though
sometimes
after
a
considerable
interval ,
into
the
old
hereditary channel .
And , even in those instances where
the succession has been violated , the crown has ever been
looked upon as hereditary in the wearer of it.
Of which
the
usurpers themselves
were so sensible , that they for
the
most
part
endeavoured to vamp up
some
feeble
show of a title by descent , in order to amuse the people
while
they
gained
possession of the
kingdom.

when possession was

being very troublesome and dangerous .
But this was with
a view to preserve, and not to destroy , the succession ; and
accordingly Edwy succeeded
him.
King Edmund
Ironside
was
obliged , by the
hostile
irruption of the Danes , at first , to divide his kingdom with
Canute king of Denmark
; and Canute , after
his
death ,
seized the whole of it, Edmund's son being
driven
into
foreign countries .
Here the succession was suspended by
actual force, and a new family introduced upon the throne :
in whom
however
this
new-acquired
throne
continued
hereditary
for
three reigns
;
when ,
upon
the
death of
Hardiknute
, the ancient
Saxon
line
was restored in the
person of Edward
the Confessor , who
was
the son of
Ethelred II. , by his
queen Emma, daughter
of Richard
duke of Normandy .
The
Confessor
was not
indeed the true heir
to the
crown , being the younger
brother of king Edmund
Iron-
side , who had a son Edward , surnamed (from his
exile )
the outlaw , still living.
But this
son was then in Hun-
gary ; and, the English having just shaken off the Danish
yoke , it was necessary that somebody on the spot should
mount the throne ; and the Confessor was the next of the
royal line
then
in England .
On
his
decease
without
issue , Harold II. usurped the throne ; and almost
at the
same instant
came on the Norman
invasion : the right to
the crown being all the time in Edgar, surnamed Atheling
(which
signifies
in the Saxon language
" illustrious ," or
of royal blood ) , who was the son of Edward
the outlaw ,
and
grandson
of
Edmund
Ironside ;
or,
as
Matthew
Paris well expresses
the sense of our
old
constitution ,

grant which , if real , was in itself utterly invalid ;
because

as
Harold well
observed
in his reply
to
William's demand (h) , " absque generali senatûs

which
plainly imply that it
then was generally

the king , with
con-

and change the line of succession.

ever, was altogether
as
good
as
Harold's , he being
a
mere

subject , and an utter
stranger to the royal

Edgar
Atheling's
undoubted
right was
over-
whelmed
by the violence of the times ; though frequently
asserted by the English nobility after the
Conquest , till
such
time
as
he
died
without
issue :
but
all
their
attempts
proved unsuccessful , and only served
the more
firmly to establish the crown in the family which
had
newly acquired it.
This conquest then by William
of Normandy
was, like
that of Canute before, a forcible transfer of the crown of
England
into a new family ;
but , the
crown
being
so
transferred , it may reasonably
be
affirmed , all the in-
herent
properties of the crown were with it transferred
also.
For ,
the
victory
obtained
at Hastings
being
a
victory not over the nation collectively , but
over the per-
son of Harold (¿) , the only right that the Conqueror could
in strictness
pretend to acquire thereby , was the right to
possess
the crown of England , not to alter the nature of
the government .
And therefore as the English laws still
remained in force, he
must
necessarily
take
the
crown
subject to those laws , and with all its inherent properties ;
the first and principal of which
was its
descendibility .
Here then we must drop our race of Saxon kings , at least
that
this
could
only
mean
heir
under the supposed will of the Con-
fessor ; for the only
dispute
as to
his title that has ever been raised
is whether
he took by the sword
or
as conquæstor by purchase under the
supposed
will
or gift of the

fessor, about the existence of which

Accordingly
it
descended
from him to his sons Wil-

Robert , it must

eldest son, was kept
out of possession by the arts and

his

who
perhaps
might proceed
upon
a notion , which
prevailed for some time in the law
of descents
(though
never
adopted as the rule of public
successions (k) ) , that
when
the eldest son was
already
provided for (as Robert was constituted duke of Normandy
by his father's will ) , in such a
case the next brother was
entitled
to enjoy
the rest of their
father's
inheritance .
But ,
as
he
died without
issue ,
Henry
at
last
had a
good title to the throne , whatever
he
might have had
at first.
Stephen of Blois , who succeeded
him, was indeed the
grandson of the Conqueror , by Adela his daughter , and
claimed
the throne by a feeble kind of hereditary right :
not
as being the nearest of the male line , but
as the
nearest
male
of the
blood
royal ,
excepting
his
elder
brother
Theobald ; who was earl of Blois , and therefore
seems
to have waived , as he certainly never insisted on ,
so troublesome
and precarious
a claim .
The
real right
was in the
empress
Matilda or
Maud , the daughter of
Henry I.; the rule of succession being (where women are
admitted at all ) that the daughter of a son shall be pre-
ferred to the son of a daughter .
So that
Stephen
was
little better than a mere usurper ; and therefore he rather
chose to rely on a title by election (1) , while
the
empress
Maud did not fail to assert her hereditary right by the

made at Walling-
ford , that Stephen should keep the crown , but that Henry
the son of Maud should
succeed
him ; as he afterwards
accordingly did.
Henry , the
second
of that name, was (next
after
his Henry II.
mother
Matilda) the
undoubted
heir
of William
the
Conqueror ; but he had also another connexion in blood ,
which endeared
him still further
to the English .
He was
lineally
descended
from Edmund Ironside , the last of the
Saxon race of hereditary kings.
For Edward the outlaw ,
the son of Edmund Ironside , had (beside Edgar Atheling ,
who died without
issue)
a daughter
Margaret , who was
married
to Malcolm
king of Scotland ; and in her
the
Saxon
hereditary
right resided .
By Malcolm she had
several children , and
among them Matilda , the wife of
Henry I., who by him had the empress
Maud , the mother
of Henry II.
Upon which
account the
Saxon line is in
our histories frequently
said to have been restored in his
person : though in reality that right subsisted in the sons
of Malcolm by queen Margaret
; king Henry's
best title
being as heir to the Conqueror .
From
Henry II. the
crown
descended
to his
eldest Richard I.
surviving
son Richard
I. , who dying
childless , the right
vested in his nephew Arthur , the son of Geoffrey his next
brother : but John , the
youngest
son of king
Henry, John .
seized
the throne ; claiming , as appears from his charters ,
the crown by hereditary
right (m ) :
that is to say, he
was next
of kin to the
deceased
king,
being
his
sur-
viving brother : whereas Arthur was removed one degree
farther ,
being
his
brother's
son ,
though
by right
of
representation
he
stood
in the
place
of
his
father
Geoffrey .
And however
flimsy
this title ,
and those of
William Rufus and Stephen of Blois , may appear at this
distance to us , after
the law of descents
has now been

settled for many centuries
,
they were sufficient
to
puzzle
the understandings
of
our brave
,
but unlettered
ancestors
.
Nor indeed can we wonder
at
the
number
of
partizans
,
who espoused
the pretensions
of
king John
in
particular
;
since
,
in
the reign
of
his father king Henry
II
.,
it
was
a
point undetermined
(n);
whether
,
even
in
common in-
heritances
,
the child
of
an
elder
brother should
succeed
to
the
land
in
right
of
representation
,
or
the younger
surviving
brother
in
right
of
proximity
of
blood
.
However
,
on the death of Arthur and his
sister
Eleanor
without
issue
,
a
clear and indisputable
title vested
in
Henry III
.
the son
of
John
:
and from him
to
Richard
II
.,
a
succes-
sion
of
six generations
,
the crown
descended
in
the true
hereditary line
.
Under one
of
which
race
of
princes
(0)
we find
a
declaration
by parliament
to
this effect
:
-That
the law
of
the crown
of
England
is
,
and always hath been
,
that the children
of
the king
of
England
,
whether born
in
England
or
elsewhere
,
ought
to
bear the
inheritance
after
the
death
of
their
ancestors
.
Which
law
our
sovereign lord the king
,
the
prelates
,
earls
,
and barons
,
and
other great
men
,
together
with all
the
commons
in
parliament
assembled
,
do
approve
and
affirm
for
ever
.
Upon Richard II.'s resignation
of
the crown
,
he
having
no children
,
the right resulted
to
the issue of his grand-
father Edward III
.
That king had many children
,
besides
his eldest
,
Edward
the black
prince
of
Wales
,
the father
of
Richard
II
.
but
to
avoid
confusion
I
shall only
mention three
;
William his second
son
,
who died without
issue
;
Lionel
,
duke
of
Clarence
,
his third son
;
and John
of
Gaunt
,
duke
of
Lancaster
,
his
fourth
.
By the rules
of
succession
,
therefore
,
the posterity
of
Lionel
duke
of
Clarence were entitled
to
the throne upon the resignation
of king Richard
;
and had accordingly
been
declared by
the king

But Henry duke of Lancaster , the son of John

then a large
army in the kingdom , the

it was impossible
for any other title to be asserted with

The proceedings
,
as
stated
in
the
Parliament
Roll
(
vol
.
3),
were
as follows
:
- In
the
first
place
,
Richard
II
.,
"
after
absolving
all
his
subjects
from
their
allegiance
and renouncing
the
name
of
king
,
and the honour
,
regality
,
and celsi-
tude
royal
,
purely
,
voluntarily
,
simply
,
and absolutely
,
by the best
way and form
that the same could
be done
,
did
confess
,
acknowledge
,
repute
,
and truly and out
of
certain
knowledge
judge
himself
to
have
been and
to
be utterly insufficient
and
unuseful
for
the
rule
and
government
of
the
said
kingdoms
and dominions
,
and
declared that
for
his
notorious
demerits
he de-
served
to
be deposed
."
We then
find
this
abdication
,
cession
,
or
renunciation
of the crown
"
unani-
mously
admitted
by the lords spiri-
tual
and
temporal
,
and the com-
mons
of
the kingdom
assembled
in
a
great
multitude
in
parliament
,"
or
rather
in
convention
,
"
the chair
of
state being then empty
,
without
any
person
whatsoever
presiding
therein
."
In the
next
place
,
we
find the convention
acting judicially
and
"
for removing
all scruples and
taking
away
sinister
suspicions
,
charging
the king with very many
crimes
and defects very often com-
mitted by him
,
and with the general
ill
-
governance
of
his kingdom
,
by
reason
of
which
they adjudged him
unworthy
to
reign
."
The
record
contains
no fewer than fifty articles
of
impeachment
,
setting
forth
elaborately
the
late
violent
and
unconstitutional
proceedings
,
and
all the
"
frauds
and deceitful tricks
of the
said
king
."
After
these
articles
and
objections
,
the
record
proceeds
thus
:
"
And
because
it
seemed to all the
estates
of the
realm
that these
causes of crimes
and
defaults
were
sufficient
and
notorious
to
depose the said king
;
considering
also his own
confession
of his insufficiency
and other things
contained
in his said renunciation
and
cession
openly
delivered
;
all
the said states did unanimously

THE
SOVEREIGN .
order to this he set up a show of two titles : the one, upon
the
pretence of being the first of the blood royal in the
entire male line , whereas the duke
of Clarence
left
only
one daughter , Philippa ; from which female branch , by a
marriage
with
Edmond
Mortimer
earl
of
March ,
the
house of York
descended
;
the
other , by
reviving
an
exploded
rumour ,
first
propagated
by John of Gaunt,
that Edmond
earl of Lancaster (to whom Henry's
mother
was
heiress)
was in
reality
the
elder brother
of king
Edward I.; though his parents , on account of his personal
deformity , had imposed him on the world for the younger ;
""
sent that ex abundante they should
proceed unto a deposition
of the said
king for the greater
security
and
tranquillity of the people and bene-
fit of the kingdom .'
Whereupon
a
commission
consisting
of
two
bishops ,
two
peers,
two
knights,
and
one justice , was
regularly
ap-
pointed
by the unanimous
consent
of the
said
estates
and
commons
"to
depose the said king from
all
kingly
dignity,
majesty ,
and
honour , on the behalf
and in the
name
and by the authority
of all
the
said
states ,
as
in
like
cases
from the ancient
custom of the said
kingdom
had been observed ."
And
forthwith the said
commissioners ,
sitting
on
a tribunal
before
the
royal chair
of state,
did
" on the
behalf
and in the name , and by the
authority
aforesaid ,
pass
sentence
of deposition
upon the king, for-
bidding all and singular
the
lords ,
archbishops , bishops , and
prelates ,
dukes ,
marquisses ,
earls,
barons ,
knights , vassals , and valvasors , and
other subjects and liege people , and
that
thenceforth
none
of
them
should any way obey or regard
the
said Richard
as king or lord of the
said kingdom
and dominion ." Com-
missioners
were
then
appointed
to
resign fealty to king Richard .
And
then presently , " as soon as it ap-
peared that the crown
of England
was vacant , Henry rising up from
his
place
and
humbly fortifying
himself with the sign of the cross
on
his
forehead and on his
breast ,
having also
first
called
upon
the
name of Christ, did claim the said
kingdom
so
vacant
as aforesaid ,
with its crown and all its members
and
appurtenances ."
After which
claim
and
challenge ,
" the lords
spiritual
and
temporal
and all the
states there present , with the whole
people , did
unanimously
consent
that
the
said
duke
should
reign
over
them ."
And in
conclusion ,
the new king showed to the states
of the
kingdom
the
signet of the
late
king, " delivered
to him as a
token
of his will that he
should
succeed him as aforesaid ."
It was
not
until
after
these
long
and
formal
proceedings
that the title of
the new king was
considered
com-
plete ,
and
his
coronation
took
place ;
after
which the
commons
chose their speaker
and the
busi-
ness of
parliament
proceeded
in
ordinary
course.



HISTORY
OF THE
SUCCESSION
TO THE
CROWN .
239
and
therefore
Henry would
be
entitled
to the crown ,
either
as
successor
to
Richard II. , in
case
the
entire
male line
was
allowed
a preference
to the
female , or ,
even prior to that unfortunate
prince , if the crown could
descend through a female , while
an entire male line was
existing .
However , as in Edward III.'s time we find the parlia-
ment approving
and
affirming
the law of the crown ,
as
before stated , so in the reign of Henry IV. they actually
exerted their right of new-settling
the succession to the
crown .
And this was done by the statute 7 Hen. 4, c. 2,
whereby it is enacted, " that the inheritance of the crown
and realms
of England
and
France ,
and all
other the
king's
dominions ,
shall
be
set
and
remain (t) in
the
presence
of our sovereign lord
the king, and in the heirs
of his body issuing ; " and prince Henry
is declared heir
apparent to the crown , to hold to him and the heirs of his
body issuing , with remainder
to lord
Thomas , lord John ,
and lord Humphry
, the king's
sons , and the heirs of their
bodies respectively : which
is indeed nothing
more than
the law would
have done before, provided Henry IV. had
been
a rightful king.
It however
serves
to show that it
was then generally understood , that
the king and parlia-
ment had a right to new-model and regulate the succession
to the crown
and we may also observe , with what caution
and delicacy
the parliament
then
avoided
declaring
any
sentiment
of Henry's original title.
However , sir Edward
Coke
more
than
once
expressly declares (u) , that at the
time of passing this act the right of the crown was
in the
descent from Philippa , daughter and heiress of Lionel duke
of Clarence .
Nevertheless
the crown descended
regularly from Henry Henry V.
IV. to his son and grandson Henry V. and Henry VI.; in Henry VI .
the latter of whose reigns the house of York asserted their
dormant title ; and , after embruing
the kingdom
in blood

THE SOVEREIGN .
and confusion for seven
years together , at last established
Edward IV. it in the person of Edward IV .
At his
accession
to the
throne , after a breach of the succession
that
continued for
three descents
, and above threescore years , the distinction
of a king de jure and
a king
de facto
began to be first
taken ; in order to indemnify
such as had submitted to the
late
establishment , and to provide
for the
peace
of the
kingdom
by confirming
all honours conferred and all acts
done, by those who were now
called the
usurpers , not
tending to the disherison of the rightful heir .
In statute
1 Edw . 4 , c.
1 , the three Henrys
are styled , " late kings
of England successively in deed , and not of right."
And ,
in charters of king Edward , where he has occasion
to speak
of any of the line of Lancaster , he calls them " nuper de
facto , et non de jure , reges Angliæ . ”
Edward V.
Richard III.
Edward IV. left two sons and a daughter
; the eldest of
which
sons, king
Edward
V. ,
having
been proclaimed
king,
was
after
two
months
deposed
by
Richard
his
unnatural
uncle ,
who
immediately
usurped
the
royal
dignity ; having
previously insinuated
to the populace
a
suspicion of bastardy in the children
of Edward IV. , to
make a show of some
hereditary title.
Afterwards
he is
generally
believed
to have murdered his two
nephews ,
upon whose death the right
to the crown devolved upon
their sister Elizabeth
.
The tyrannical
reign of king Richard III . gave occasion
to Henry earl of Richmond
to assert his title to the crown .
A title the most remote and unaccountable
that was ever
set up , and which nothing
could
have given
success
to ,
but the universal detestation of the then usurper Richard .
For , besides that Henry claimed under a descent from John
of Gaunt , whose title was now exploded , the claim (such
as it was) was through John earl of Somerset , a bastard
son, begotten by John of Gaunt upon Catherine
Swinford .
It is true , that by an act of parliament , 20 Ric. 2 , this son
was, with others , legitimated
and made inheritable
to all
lands , offices , and dignities ,
as if he had
been born in

:
wedlock
but still with an
express
reservation
of the
crown , " exceptâ dignitate regali " (x).
Notwithstanding
all this , immediately
after the battle
Henry VII.
of Bosworth
field , Henry
earl of Richmond
assumed the
regal dignity ; the right to the crown then being , as sir
Edward Coke
expressly declares ( y) , in Elizabeth
, eldest
daughter
of Edward IV.: and his
possession was estab-
lished by parliament , holden
the
first
year of his reign .
In the
act for which purpose , the
parliament
seems
to
have copied the caution of their predecessors
in the reign
of Henry IV.; and therefore (as lord Bacon , the historian
of this reign ,
observes
(z ) ) carefully avoided
any recog-
nition of Henry VII.'s right , which
indeed was
none
at
all ; and the king would not have it by way of new law or
ordinance , whereby a right might seem to be
created
and
conferred
upon him ; and therefore
middle
course was
rather chosen by way (as the noble historian
expresses it)
of" establishment ," and that under covert and indifferent
words , " that the inheritance
of the
crown
should
rest ,
remain , and abide in " king Henry VII. and the heirs of
his body ; thereby providing
for the future , and
at the
same time acknowledging
his present possession
; but not
determining
either way , whether
that
possession was de
jure or de facto merely .
However , he soon after married
Elizabeth of York, the undoubted
heiress of the Conqueror ,
and thereby gained
(as
sir
Edward
Coke declares
(a)
)
by
much his
best title
to
the crown

Whereupon

in

first , by statute
25 Henry 8 , c.
22, which
recites
the
mischiefs which
have and
may ensue
by disputed
titles ,
because
no perfect
and
substantial
provision
hath
been
made by law concerning
the succession ; and then enacts ,
that the crown shall
be entailed
to his majesty , and the
sons or heirs
male of his body ; and in
default
of such
sons to the lady Elizabeth
(who
is
declared to be the
king's eldest issue female , in exclusion of the lady Mary ,
on account of her supposed
illegitimacy
by the divorce of
her mother
queen
Catherine ) and to the lady Elizabeth's
heirs of her body ; and so on from
issue female to issue
female , and the heirs of their bodies , by course of inherit-
ance according
to their ages ,
as the crown
of England
hath
been accustomed and ought
to go," in cases where
there be heirs female to the same : and , in default of issue
female , then to the king's right
heirs
for
ever .
This
single
statute is an ample proof of all the four positions
we at first set out with .
66
But upon the king's divorce
from
Ann
Boleyn , this
statute was, with regard to the settlement of the crown ,
repealed by statute
28 Hen .
8 ,
c .
7 , wherein
the lady
Elizabeth is also, as well as the lady Mary, bastardized ,
and the crown settled
on the king's
children by queen
Jane
Seymour , and his future
wives ; and , in defect of
such
children , then with this remarkable
remainder , to
such persons
as
the king by letters
patent , or last will
and testament , should
limit
and appoint
the same.
A
vast power ;
but ,
notwithstanding
,
as it was
regularly
vested in him by the
supreme
legislative
authority , it
was therefore
indisputably
valid .
But this
power
was
never
carried into execution ; for by statute
35 Hen. 8,
c.
1 , the king's two daughters
are legitimated
again , and
the crown is limited
to prince Edward
by name , after that
to the lady Mary, and then to the lady Elizabeth
, and the
heirs
of their respective bodies ;
which
succession took
effect accordingly , being
indeed no other than the usual
course of the law, with regard to the descent of the crown .


HISTORY
OF THE
SUCCESSION
TO THE
CROWN .
243
But
lest there should remain
any doubt in the minds
Mary.
of the
people , through
this jumble of acts
for limiting
the
succession , by statute
1
Mar.
sess .
3,
c.
1 , queen
Mary's
hereditary
right
to the
throne
is acknowledged
and recognized
in these words : the crown of this realm
" is most lawfully , justly , and rightfully descended
and
come
unto the queen's
highness
that now is , being
the
very, true, and
undoubted
heir
and inheritrix
thereof ."
And
again ,
upon
the
queen's
marriage
with Philip
of
Spain , in the statute which settles the preliminaries
of
that match (6) , the hereditary right to the
crown is thus
asserted
and
declared :
as
touching
the
right
of the
queen's
inheritance
in
the
realm
and
dominions
of
England , the
children , whether
male
or female , " shall
succeed in them, according
to the laws ,
statutes , and
customs
of the
same."
Which
determination
of
the
parliament , that the succession
shall
continue
in the
usual
course ,
seems
tacitly to imply a power of new-
modelling
and
altering
it , in case
the
legislature
had
thought proper .
On queen Elizabeth's accession
, her right is recognized
Elizabeth.
in still stronger
terms than
her sister's ; the parliament
acknowledging
(c) , that the queen's highness " is , and in
very deed and of most
mere right ought to be , by the
laws
of God , and the
laws
and
statutes of this
realm ,
our most
rightful
and lawful
sovereign
liege
lady
and
queen :'" and that her highness " is rightly , lineally, and
lawfully
descended
and
come of the blood
royal of this
realm of England ; in and to whose princely
person , and
to the heirs of her
body lawfully to be begotten , after
her," the imperial
crown
and dignity of this realm doth
belong .
And in the same reign , by statute 13 Eliz . c . 1 ,
we find the right of parliament
to direct
the succession
of the crown
asserted in the most
explicit
words .
" If
any person shall in any wise
hold , and affirm , or main-

tain that the common laws of this realm , not altered by
parliament , ought not to direct
the right of the crown of
England ;" or that the queen's majesty , with and by the
authority of parliament , " is not able to make laws and
statutes of sufficient
force and validity , to limit and bind
the
crown
of this
realm ,
and
the
descent, limitation ,
inheritance , and government
thereof ; "-such person , so
holding , affirming , or maintaining
, during the life of the
queen , shall be guilty of high treason ;
and
after
her
decease shall forfeit his goods and chattels .
On the
death of queen
Elizabeth , without
issue, the
line of Henry VIII . became
extinct .
It therefore became
necessary to recur
to the
other
issue of Henry VII. by
Elizabeth of York
his
queen ;
whose
eldest
daughter
Margaret
having
married
James IV. king of Scotland ,
king James the Sixth of Scotland , and of England the First ,
was the lineal descendant from that alliance .
So that in
his
person ,
as
clearly
as in Henry VIII . , centered all
the claims
of different
competitors , from the Conquest
downwards ,
he

indisputably the

heir of
the
Conqueror .
And , what
is still more remarkable , in
his person also centered
the right of the Saxon monarchs
which
had
been
suspended
from the
Conquest
till
his
accession.
For , as was formerly
observed
, Margaret , the
sister of Edgar Atheling , the
daughter
of Edward the
outlaw , and grand -daughter
of king
Edmund
Ironside ,
was the person in whom the hereditary right of the Saxon
kings, supposing
it not
abolished
by the Conquest , re-
sided .
She
married
Malcolm
king
of
Scotland
;
and
Henry II. , by a descent from Matilda their daughter , is
generally
called
the restorer of the Saxon line .
But it
must
be remembered , that Malcolm by his
Saxon
queen
had sons
as well
as daughters : and that the royal family
of Scotland from that time
downwards were the offspring
of Malcolm
and
Margaret .
Of this royal
family king
James I. was the direct
lineal
heir , and therefore united
in his person every possible claim by hereditary right to

the
heir
of both Egbert and William the Conqueror .
And it is no wonder that a prince of greater learning than
wisdom , who
could
deduce
an hereditary title
for
more
than eight hundred
years , should
easily be taught by the
flatterers
of the
times , to
believe
there was something
divine
in this right , and that

was visible
in its preservation .
Whereas , though a wise
institution , it was clearly
a human
institution ; and the
right
inherent
in him
no natural , but
a positive
right.
And
in this
and
no
other
light
was it taken
by the
English
parliament ; who by statute
1 Jac.
1 ,
c.
1, did
"recognise
and
acknowledge ," that
immediately
upon
the
dissolution
and
decease
of Elizabeth
late
queen of
England, the imperial crown
thereof " did by inherent
birthright , and lawful and undoubted succession
, descend
and
come to " his
most
excellent
majesty , " as
being
lineally, justly , and lawfully , next
and
sole heir of the
blood royal of this realm ."
Not a word here of any right
immediately
derived
from
heaven
: which , if it existed
any where , must
be sought for among the aborigines of
the
island , the
ancient
Britons
;
among
whose
princes
indeed some have gone to seek it for him (d).
But , wild
and
absurd
as the doctrine
of divine
right CharlesI.
most
undoubtedly
is , it is scarcely less
astonishing , that
when so many human
hereditary rights
had
centered
in
this king , his son and heir king Charles I. should
be told
by the judges who pronounced
his
sentence , that he was
an elective prince ; elected by his people , and
therefore
accountable
to
them , in his own
proper
person , for his
conduct (e) .
Very different
from this was the language
(d) Elizabeth
of York , the mother
of queen Margaret
of Scotland , was
heiress of the house
of Mortimer.
And
Mr.
Carte
observes
that the
house of Mortimer,
in virtue
of its
descent
from
Gladys
only sister
to
Lewillin ap Jorwerth the Great , had
the true right to the principality of

that it passed
the house of commons , but was rejected by
the lords ; the king having also declared beforehand , that
he never would
be brought
to consent to it.
And from
this
transaction we may collect
two things :
1.
That the
crown
was universally
acknowledged
to be hereditary ;
and the
inheritance
indefeasible
unless by parliament :
else it had been needless to prefer
such a bill .
2.
That
the parliament
had a power to have defeated
the inherit-
ance : else such a bill had been ineffectual .
The commons
acknowledged
the hereditary
right then subsisting ; and
the lords
did not dispute the power , but merely the pro-
priety of an
exclusion .
However ,
as
the bill took
no
effect , king
James II.

throne

and might
have
enjoyed it during the
re-
mainder of his life, but for his own infatuated
conduct ,
which (with other concurrent circumstances ), brought on
the Revolution
in 1688 .
of 1683.
That memorable
event ensued
upon
the abdication of Revolution
the reigning
monarch , and a vacancy of the throne thereby
occasioned
.
There had not been a defeasance
of the right
of succession, and a new limitation of the crown , by the
king and both houses of parliament
; it was the act of the
nation alone , upon a conviction
that there was no king in
being .
For in a full assembly of the lords and commons ,
met in a convention
upon the supposition of this vacancy,
both
houses (h) resolved :-that king James II. , by the
advice of divers
evil counsellors , judges ,
and ministers
employed by him, did endeavour to
subvert and extirpate
the protestant religion , and the laws and liberties of this
kingdom , and,
having
abdicated the government , that
the
throne
is thereby vacant (i).
Thus

once ,

conclusion- " The

old line
of

which
from the Conquest
had
lasted
above six hundred
years ,
and from the union of

The
facts themselves
thus
appealed to , the king's endeavour
to subvert the constitution
by breaking
the original
con-
tract ,
his
violation
of the fundamental
laws , and
his
withdrawing himself out of the kingdom , were evident
and notorious ; and the
consequences
drawn
from
these
facts (namely , that they amounted to an abdication of the
government ;
which
abdication

and may be contemplated with interest by the philoso-
phical historian , with interest
however due to the magni-
tude of the event thus
consummated
rather
than
to its
value
as a precedent.
For should a political
crisis equally
imminent recur , posterity regardless of the text of prece-
dents will act.
But, without
overvaluing
this fundamental
transaction ,
as a precedent, we are bound both in justice and gratitude
to note that it was conducted with a temper and modera-
tion which naturally
arose from its equity ; that , however
it might
in some respects go beyond
the
letter of our
ancient laws (the reason of which will more fully appear
hereafter (1)) , it was agreeable to the spirit of our consti-
tution, and the rights of human nature ; and that though
in other points (owing
to the peculiar
circumstances of
things and persons) it was not altogether
so perfect
as
might have been wished , yet from thence a new era com-
menced , in which
the bounds of prerogative
and liberty'
have
been better
defined, the
principles
of government
more thoroughly
examined and understood , and the rights
of the subject more explicitly guarded by legal provisions ,
than in any other period of English history .
In particular
it
is worthy of observation
that
the convention , in this
their judgment,
avoided
with
great
wisdom
the wild
extremes
into which the visionary theories of some zealous
republicans
would
have led them .
They held that the
misconduct of king James amounted to an " endeavour "
to subvert the constitution
; and not to an actual subver-
sion , or total
dissolution , of the government , according
to the principles
of Mr.
Locke (m) : which would
have
reduced
society almost
to a state of nature ; would
have
levelled
all
distinctions
of
honour ,
rank,
offices ,
and
and
Hooker
(Ecc .
Pol .),
affirms
that "the constitution
of England
is founded upon
compact , and that
the subjects of this kingdom
have
in their
several public and private
capacities as legal a title to what are
their rights
by law as a prince to
the possession of his crown ."

property ; would have annihilated
the sovereign
power ,
and in consequence
have repealed or jeopardized the effi-
cacy of all positive laws ; and would have left the people
at liberty to have erected a new system of state upon a
new foundation
of polity .
They therefore very prudently
voted it to amount to
no more than an abdication of the
government ,
and
a
consequent vacancy of the throne ;
whereby the government was allowed
to subsist , though
the executive
magistrate was gone ,
and the kingly office
to remain , though
king James was no longer
king (n) .
And thus the constitution
was kept
entire ; which
upon
every
sound
principle of
government
must
otherwise
have fallen to pieces , had so principal
and constituent
a
part of it
as
the
royal
authority
been
abolished ,
or
suspended.
This
single postulate , the vacancy of the throne , being
once
established , the
rest that was then
done followed
almost
of course.
For, if the throne
be at any time.
vacant (which
may happen by other means besides that
of abdication
;
as if all the blood royal should fail, with-
out any successor
appointed
by parliament ) ; if, I say,
a
vacancy by any means
whatsoever
should
happen , the
right
of
disposing
of this
vacancy
seems
naturally
to
result to the lords
and commons , the trustees and repre-
sentatives of the nation .
For there are
no other hands
in which it can so properly
be intrusted ; and there is a
necessity for
its
being
intrusted
somewhere ,
else
the
whole frame of government must be dissolved and perish .
The lords and commons having
therefore determined this
main fundamental
article , that there was a vacancy of the
throne , proceeded
to fill up that vacancy in such a manner
as they judged
the most proper .
And this was done by
their declaration
of 12 February , 1688 ( 0) , in the follow-
William and ing manner : "that
William
and
Mary,
prince
and
princess of Orange , be , and be declared king and queen

of England , to hold
the crown and royal dignity during
their
lives ,
and
the life
of the survivor
of them
; and
" that the
sole and full exercise of the
regal power be
only in, and executed by, the
said prince of Orange , in
the names of the said prince
and princess , during
their
joint lives : and after
their
deceases
the said
crown and
royal dignity "... " to be to the heirs of the body of the
said princess ; and for default of such issue to the princess
Anne of Denmark
and the heirs
of her body ; and for
default of such issue to the heirs of the body of the said
prince of Orange ."
Doubtless , upon the
principles
before established , the
convention
might
(if they pleased) have vested
the regal
dignity in a family entirely
new ,
and strangers
to the
royal blood ; but they were
too well
acquainted with the
benefits of hereditary
succession
, and the influence which
it has by custom over the minds of the people , to depart
any farther from the ancient line than
temporary neces-
sity and self-preservation required .
They therefore settled
the crown , first on king William
and queen Mary, king
James's eldest daughter , for their joint lives : then on the
survivor of them ; and then on the issue of queen Mary :
upon failure of such issue, it was limited
to the princess
Anne, king James's
second
daughter , and her issue ; and
lastly , on failure
of that to the
issue of king William ,
who was the grandson
of Charles I. , and nephew as well
as son-in-law of king James II. , being the son of Mary
his eldest sister .
This settlement
included
all the pro-
testant
posterity
of king
Charles
I.
except
such
other
issue as king James might at any time have, which was
totally omitted , through fear of a popish succession .
And
this order of succession took effect accordingly .
These
three
princes
therefore ,
king William, queen
Mary, and queen
Anne , did
not take the crown by here-
ditary right or descent, but by way of donation
or pur-
chase,
as the lawyers
call it ; by which they mean any
method of acquiring
an estate otherwise than by descent.


252
THE SOVEREIGN .
The new settlement did not merely consist in excluding
king James, and
the person
pretended to be prince of
Wales, and then suffering
the crown
to
descend in the
old hereditary
channel : for the usual
course
of descent
was in some instances broken
through ; and yet the con-
vention still kept it in their eye , and paid a great , though
not total , regard
to it.
Let us
see how the succession.
would
have stood, if no abdication
had
happened ,
and
king James had left no other issue than his two daughters
queen Mary and queen Anne.
It would have stood thus :
queen Mary and her issue : queen
Anne
and her
issue
:
king William
and his issue .
But
we may remember ,
that queen Mary was only nominally queen , jointly with
her
husband
king William ,
who
alone
had
the
regal
power ;
and king William
was personally
preferred
to
queen Anne , though
his issue
was
postponed
to
hers .
Clearly therefore these princes
were successively in pos-
session of the crown by a title different
from the usual
course of descent.
It was towards the end of king William's
reign , when
all hopes of any surviving
issue from
any of these princes
died with the
duke
of
Gloucester ,
that
the king
and
parliament
thought it
necessary
again
to
exert their
power of limiting and appointing
the succession, in order
to prevent another vacancy of the
throne ; which
must
have ensued upon their
deaths, as
no further
provision
was made at the Revolution , than for the issue of queen
Mary, queen
Anne, and king William .
The
parliament
had previously
by the statute
1 Will . & M. st. 2 , c.
2 ,
enacted , that
every person who
should be reconciled to ,
or hold communion with , the see of Rome , should profess
the popish religion , or should
marry
a papist , should be
excluded and be for ever incapable to inherit , possess , or
enjoy the crown : and that in such
case the people should
be absolved from their
allegiance , and the
crown
should
descend to such
persons ,
being
protestants ,
as
would
have inherited
the
same , in
case the
person

ciled , holding
communion , professing , or marrying , were
naturally dead .
To act therefore consistently with them-
selves , and at the same
time
pay as much
regard
to the
old
hereditary
line
as their
former
resolutions
would
admit , they
turned
their
eyes
on the
princess
Sophia ,
electress
and
duchess
dowager of
Hanover ,
the
most
accomplished
princess
of her
age (p).
For ,
upon the
impending
extinction
of
the
protestant
posterity
of
Charles I. , the old law of regal
descent directed
them to
recur to the descendants of James I.;
and the princess
Sophia , being the youngest
daughter of Elizabeth queen
of Bohemia , who was the daughter of James I. , was the
nearest of the ancient blood
royal , who was not incapaci-
tated by professing the popish religion .
On her therefore ,
and the heirs of her body, being protestants , the remainder
of the crown , expectant on the death of king William and
queen Anne, without
issue , was settled by statute 12 & 13
Will.
3 ,
c.
2.
And at the
same
time it was enacted
that whosoever should hereafter come to the possession of
the crown should join in the communion of the church of
England as by law established .
This is the last limitation
of the crown that has been
made by parliament
; and these several actual limitations
,
from the time of Henry IV. to the present ,
do clearly
prove the
power
of the
king
and
parliament
to new
model
or alter
the
succession.
And
indeed it is now
made highly penal
to dispute it : for by the
statute

the
inheritance
thus
limited descended

the inheritance descended

Hence
it
is
easy
to
collect
,
that the title

is
at
present
hereditary
,
though
not
quite
so
absolutely
hereditary
as
formerly
;
and the common stock

ances-
tor
,
from
whom
the
descent
must
be derived
,
is
also
different
.
Formerly the common stock was king Egbert
;
then William

Conqueror
;
afterwards
in
James I.'s
time the two common stocks united
,
and
so
continued till
the vacancy
of
the throne
in
1688
:
now
it
is
the princess
Sophia
,
in
whom
the inheritance
was vested by the new
king and parliament
.
Formerly the descent was
abso-
lute
,
and the crown went
to
the next heir without
any
restriction
but now
,
upon the
new settlement
,
the inhe-
ritance
is
conditional
;
being limited
to
such heirs only

of
the
body
of
the
princess
Sophia
,
as
are protestant
members of the church

,
and
are married
to
none but protestants

consists , I apprehend , the
true constitutional
notion of
the right of succession to the imperial crown of these
kingdoms .
The
extremes
between which it
steers ,
are
equally
destructive of those
ends
for which societies were
formed
and
are kept
on foot .
Where the
magistrate ,
upon every succession , is
elected
by the people , and may
by the express provision
of the laws
be deposed
(if not
punished ) by his
subjects, this
may sound like the per-
fection of liberty , and look well
enough when delineated
on paper : but in practice will be ever productive of tumult ,
contention , and anarchy .
And , on the other hand , divine
indefeasible
hereditary right , when
coupled with the doc-
trine of unlimited
passive obedience
, is
surely of all con-
stitutions
the most thoroughly
slavish and dreadful .
But
when such an hereditary right , as our laws
have created
and vested in the royal
stock , is closely interwoven with
those liberties , which , we have
seen in a former chapter ,
are equally
the inheritance
of
the subject ; this union
will form a constitution , in theory the most beautiful
of
any, in
practice
the
most
approved , and, I trust, in
duration the most permanent .
It was the duty of an
expounder of our laws to lay this constitution
before the
student in its true and genuine
light : it is the duty of
every
good

THE
ROYAL
FAMILY .
We shall in this chapter speak of the members of the
royal
family in
the
order
which
seems
natural
and
proper .
The
queen of England is either
queen regent , queen
consort , or queen
dowager .
The
queen
regent , regnant ,
or sovereign ,
is
she who
holds
the
crown in her
own
right ; as the first (and perhaps the second ) queen Mary,
queen
Elizabeth ,
queen
Anne ,
and
our
present
most
gracious
sovereign
queen
Victoria ; and
such
a one
has
the
same
powers ,
prerogatives ,
rights ,
dignities ,
and
duties , as if she had been
a king .
This was observed
at
the commencement of the last
chapter , and is expressly
declared by statute
1 Mar.

But the queen
consort is the wife
of the
reigning
king ; and
she , by
virtue of her marriage , is participant
of divers prerogatives
above other women (a).
And , first , she is a public
person , exempt and distinct
and distinct from
the king : and not , like
other
married
women , so

closely
connected
as
to have lost all
legal
or
separate
existence
so long
as the
marriage
continues .
For
a
queen
consort is of ability to
purchase
lands , and to
convey them, to make
leases , to grant copyholds ,
and
do
other
acts
of ownership , without the
concurrence
of
her lord
which
no other married woman
can do (b) ; a
privilege
as old as the Saxon era (c) .
She is also capable

of taking
a grant from the king , and in this
particular
she agrees
with
the
Augusta , or piissima
regina conjux
divi imperatoris
of the Roman laws ; who , according
to
Justinian (d) , was
equally
capable of
making
a grant
to, and receiving
one from, the emperor .
The queen of
England
has separate
courts
and
officers
distinct
from
the king's, not only in matters of ceremony , but even of
law ; and her
attorney and
solicitor -general
are entitled
to a place within the bar of his majesty's courts , together
with the king's counsel (e) .
She may likewise
sue
and
be sued alone, without
joining
her husband .
She
may
also have a separate property in goods
as well
as lands ,
and has a right to dispose of them by will (ƒ) .
In short ,
she is in all legal proceedings looked upon as a feme
sole ,
and not as a feme covert ; as
a single , not as a married
woman (g) .
For which
the reason given by sir Edward
Coke is this : because
the wisdom
of the
common law
would not have the king (whose continual
care and study
is for the public , and circa ardua
regni )
to be troubled
and
disquieted
on
account of his wife's domestic affairs ;
and therefore it vests in the queen a power of transacting
her own concerns , without
the intervention
of the king,
as if she was an unmarried
woman .
tions.
The
queen
consort
has
also
many
exemptions ,
and Her exemp-
minute
prerogatives .
For instance :
she pays no toll (½) ;
nor is she liable to any amercement in any court (i) .
But
in general , unless where
the law has expressly declared
her exempted , she is upon
the
same footing with other
subjects ; being
to all
intents
and
purposes
the king's
subject, and not
his
equal ;

THE
ROYAL
FAMILY .
Her reve
nue.
The
queen
enjoys
also
some
pecuniary
advantages ,
which in early times formed
for her a distinct
revenue :
as , in the first place , she is
entitled
to an ancient per-
quisite
called
queen-gold ,
or
aurum
reginæ ;
which
is
a royal revenue , belonging
to every queen consort during
her marriage with the king , and
due from every person
who
has made a voluntary
offering
or fine to the king
amounting
to ten
marks
or upwards , for
and
in
con-
sideration
of any privileges , grants , licences , pardons , or
other matter of royal
favour
conferred upon him by the
king
it is due in the proportion
of one-tenth part more ,
over and
above the entire
offering
or fine made
to the
king ; and becomes
an actual debt of record to the queen's
majesty by the mere recording
of the
fine (7) .
As , if a
hundred marks of silver be given
to the king for liberty
to take in mortmain ,
or to have
a fair, market , park ,
chase , or free-warren : there the
queen is entitled
to ten
marks
in
silver ,
or
(what
was
formerly
an
equivalent
denomination )
to
one
mark in
gold , by the
name of
queen-gold , or aurum reginæ (m) .
But no such payment
is due for any aids or subsidies
granted
to the king in
parliament
or
convocation ;
nor
for
fines
imposed
by
courts
on offenders, against
their will ; nor for voluntary
presents to the king , without any consideration
moving
from
him
to the subject ; nor for any sale or
contract
whereby the present revenues
or possessions
of the crown
are granted away or diminished (n).
The original revenue of our ancient queens , before and
soon
after
the
Conquest ,
seems
to
have
consisted in
certain
reservations
or rents
out of
the
demesne
lands
of the
crown , which
were expressly
appropriated
to her
majesty ,
distinct
from
the king.
It is
frequent
in
domesday book ,
after
specifying
the
rent
due
to the
crown , to
add
likewise
the
quantity
of gold

These were frequently
appropriated
to particular
purposes : to buy wool for her
majesty's
use (p), to purchase oil for her lamps (9) ,
or
to furnish her
attire

to foot (r) ,
which
was
frequently very costly , as one single robe in the fifth year
of Henry II. stood

A practice
somewhat
similar to
that of the
eastern
countries ,
where whole
cities
and
provinces were specifically
assigned to purchase particular
parts
of the queen's
apparel (t).
And , for
a further
addition
to
her
income , this
duty
of
queen -gold
is
supposed to have been
originally granted ; those matters
of grace
and favour , out of which it
arose , being
fre-
quently obtained
from the crown by the powerful
inter-
cession of the queen .
There
are
traces of its payment ,
though obscure
ones , in the book of domesday and in the
great pipe -roll of Henry I. (u)
In the reign of Henry II.

appears to have been

to
Gervase
of Tilbury.

THE
ROYAL FAMILY .
enjoyed by all
the queen consorts of England till the
death of Henry VIII.; though
from the accession of the
Tudor family the collecting of it seems to have been much
neglected : and , there being no queen consorts afterwards
till the accession of James I. , its very nature and quantity
became then
a matter of doubt : and , being
referred by
the king to the chief justices and chief baron , their report
of it was so very unfavourable (y), that
his consort queen
Anne (though
she claimed it) yet never thought
proper
to exact it.
In
1635 ,
11 Car .

a
time
fertile
of ex-
pedients
for raising
money upon
dormant
precedents in
our old records (of which ship -money was a fatal instance ) ,
the king , at the petition
of his
queen , Henrietta
Maria ,
issued
out his writ (z) for levying
it :
but
afterwards
purchased it of his
consort
at the price of ten thousand
pounds ; finding it , perhaps , too trifling and troublesome
to levy.
And when
afterwards ,
at the
Restoration , by
the abolition
of the military tenures , and the fines that
were
consequent
upon them, the little that legally re-
mained of this revenue was reduced
to almost nothing at
all, in vain did Mr. Prynne, by a treatise which
does
honour
to
his
abilities
as
a painstaking
and judicious
writer ,
endeavour
to excite
queen
Catherine
to revive
this antiquated claim .
Another
ancient
perquisite
belonging
to the
queen
consort , mentioned by our old writers (a), and
on that
account only worth
notice , is this :
that
on the taking
of a whale
on the
coasts , which
is a royal
fish , it shall
be divided
between the king and
queen
; the head only
being the king's property , and the tail of it the queen's .

But further : though the
queen is in all
respects
a
subject ,
yet , in point of the
security of her
life
and
person , she
is put
on the same footing
with the king.
It
is
equally
treason (by the
statute
25
Edw .
3)
to
compass
or imagine
the
death of our
lady the king's
companion ,
as of
the
king himself : and
to violate , or
defile the queen
consort , amounts to the same high crime ;
as well in the person committing
the fact , as in the queen
herself, if consenting .
A law of Henry VIII . (c) made
it treason also for any woman , who was not a virgin , to
marry the king without informing him thereof : but this
law was
soon
after
repealed (d ), it
trespassing
too
strongly , as well on natural justice , as on female modesty .
If, however , the queen be accused
of any species of treason ,
she shall (whether
consort
or dowager ) be tried by the
peers of parliament ,
as

Ann

The husband of a queen regnant , as prince George of The husband
Denmark was

Anne ,
or
as
the
late
prince
consort (e) was
to her majesty
queen Victoria ,
is
her
subject ; and may be guilty of high treason against her
but, in the
instance
of
conjugal
infidelity,
he is
not
subjected to the same
penal
restrictions .
For which
the
reason seems to be , that if a queen
consort is unfaithful
to the royal
bed, this
may debase
or bastardize
the heirs.
to the crown ; but no such danger can be consequent on
the infidelity of the husband
to a queen regnant .

A queen dowager is the widow of the king , and as such Queen
enjoys most of the privileges
belonging
to her
as
queen
consort .
But it is not high treason to conspire her death,
or to violate
her
chastity , for
the
same reason

the succession to the crown is not
thereby
endangered .
Yet
still , pro
dignitate
regali , no
man can marry a queen dowager without
special licence
from the king , on pain of forfeiting
his lands and goods .
This sir Edward
Coke (f) tells
us was
enacted in par-
liament in 6 Hen. 6 , though the statute be not in print (9).
But she, though an alien born , shall
still
be entitled
to
dower
after the king's demise , as no

so, the

Navarre

with
Edmond

to
king Edward I. , maintained an action of dower (after the
death of her second husband ) by the name of queen

For , by statute

are as
much
high
treason
as to conspire

wife might taint the blood royal with bastardy ; and the
eldest daughter of the king is sole
heiress to the crown ,
on failure
of issue male , and
therefore more
respected
by the laws
than any of her younger
sisters ; insomuch
that upon
this, united
with other (feudal )
principles ,
while our military tenures were in force, the king might
levy an aid for marrying
his
eldest daughter , and her
only.
The heir apparent (k) to the crown is usually made
prince of Wales and earl of Chester , by special creation
and investiture ; and if born after his father's accession
to
the throne he is by inheritance , peculiar in

(

Lord Brougham
observes
as
follows
:
-The
duchy
of
Cornwall
was
created
by Edward
III
.
for the
Black
Prince
in the
eleventh
year
of
his
reign
,
by
a
charter
made
in
parliament
,
and
having the force
of
a
statute
,
as
was
solemnly
adjudged
in
the Prince's
case
,
8
Rep
.
1.
The species
of
suc-
cession
is
of
a
singular
nature
.
The
duchy vests
in
the king's eldest son
and heir apparent
of
the
crown
at
the instant of his birth
,
and with-
out gift
or
creation
;
it
vests in
him
,
too
,
according
to
the sounder
opinion
,
as
if
he were
of
full
age at
his birth
,
and
as
if
minority could
no more be predicated
of
him than
of
the
sovereign
himself
.
Lord
Coke
,
indeed
,
has
said
that
only
the
first
-
born
son takes the duchy
,
and that
on
his
decease without
issue the second or other son cannot
succeed
.
But this has been refuted
by Lord Hardwicke in Lomax
v.
Holmden
,
1
Ves
.
Sen. 295
,
referring
to
the fact
of
Henry VIII
.
being
duke of Cornwall
after the death of
his brother
prince Arthur
;
and
to
Charles
I.
(
then
prince
Charles
)
having
the
duchy
after
prince
Henry's death
.
Yet still the shift-
ing
of
the title
is
of
a
very peculiar
nature
.
For if the crown devolves
upon the duke
of
Cornwall
having
no
son
,
there
ceases
to
be
a
duke
,
and then the duchy
is
in
the crown
.
But
at
any moment
a
son may be
born
;
his birth divests the duchy
;
and the duke then holds
it
subject
to
the
double
contingency
of his
own
and his
father's
death
.

THE ROYAL FAMILY .
Younger
sons and
The rest of the royal family may be considered in two
different lights , according to the different
senses in which
the
term " royal
family " is
used.
The larger
sense
includes all those who
are by any possibility
inheritable
to the crown .
Such , before the Revolution , were all the
descendants of William the Conqueror
; who had branched
into
an
amazing
extent ,
by
intermarriages
with the
ancient nobility.
Since the
Revolution
and Act of Set-
tlement , it means the
protestant
issue of the princess
Sophia ;
which
in process of time
may possibly
be
as
largely diffused .
The more confined
sense
includes only
those , who are in
a certain
degree of propinquity
to the
reigning
prince , and to whom
therefore the law pays an
extraordinary
regard and
respect : but , after that degree
is past , the relations of the sovereign fall into the rank of
ordinary
subjects , and
are seldom considered any further ,
unless called to the succession upon failure of the nearer
lines .
For , though
collateral
consanguinity
is regarded
indefinitely
, with respect to inheritance
or succession
, yet
it is , and can only be regarded , within some certain limits ,
in any other respect , by the natural constitution
of things
and the dictates of positive law (m).
The younger
sons and daughters of the king, and other
branches of the royal
family , who are not in the imme-
diate line of
succession,
were
therefore
little
further
regarded by the
ancient law, than
to give them, to a
certain
degree ,
precedence
before
all
peers
and
public
officers, as well ecclesiastical as temporal .
This is done by
the statute
31
Hen . 8 , c. 10, which enacts , that no person ,
except the king's children , shall
presume to sit or have
" The
duchy
of Cornwall ," says
Lord Abinger
(Jewison
v.
Dyson ,
9 M.
& W. 588), " is indeed
a very
peculiar
tenure .
It
only
exists
when
there is the
eldest
son of a
king born after he becomes reigning
king.
He alone
can
enjoy it, and
the
moment
he
becomes king it
ceases
and
is
absorbed
in
the
crown ."

certain great
officers therein
named
shall
have precedence above
all dukes , except only such
as
shall
happen
to be
the king's
son ,
brother ,
uncle ,
nephew (which
sir Edward
Coke ( n) explains
to signify
grandson
or nepos ) , or brother's
or sister's son .
Therefore ,
after these degrees
are
past , peers
or others
of the blood
royal are entitled
to no place or precedence
except what
belongs to them by their personal rank or dignity.

second

of York , it might

their
grandsons
would have
precedence
of the grandsons of the duke of
York.
Indeed , under
the description
of the king's children , Grandsons.
his grandsons
are held
to be included ,
without
having
recourse to sir Edward
Coke's
interpretation
of nephew :
and
therefore
when
his
late
majesty king
George II.
created his grandson Edward , the second
son of Frederick
prince of Wales
deceased , duke of York , and referred it
to the house of lords to settle his place and
precedence
,
they certified (p) that he ought to have place next to the
then
duke of Cumberland , the king's youngest
son ; and
that he might have a seat on the left hand of the cloth of
estate .
But when , on the accession of king George III . ,
those
royal
personages
ceased
to take
place as children ,
and ranked only as the brother and uncle of the king , they
also left their
seats on the side of the cloth of estate :
so
that when the duke of Gloucester , his then majesty's second
brother , took his
seat in the house of peers
(q) , he was
placed on the upper end of the earls ' bench (on which the
dukes
usually
sit ) next to his royal highness the duke of
York .

judges by king George I. , it was resolved by the opinion of
ten against the other two (r), that the education and care
of all the king's grandchildren
while
minors , belonged of
right to his majesty
as king of this
realm , even
during
their father's life (s ) .
And they all agreed , that the care
and
approbation
of their
marriages , when
grown
up ,
belonged to the king their grandfather .
The judges also
have
more
recently
concurred
in
opinion (t) , that
this

approbation
extend to
the
presumptive
heir
of the crown ;

to what

royal family the same extended they did not find precisely

The most frequent
instances of the crown's
interposition
go no further
than nephews and nieces (u) ;

are not wanting
of its
reaching to more
distant
collaterals (x) .
And the statute 6 Hen . 6 , before
mentioned , which
prohibited
the
marriage of
a
queen
dowager without the
consent of the
king , assigns
this
reason for it
because
the " disparagement " of the queen

royal , more lightly to

without the previous consent of the king signified
under

such
consent is void .

contract

all
persons
solemnising , assisting , or being
present at any

peers.
2.
Secondly , the
peers of the realm
are by their birth 2. The
hereditary
counsellors of the crown , and may be called to-
gether by the
sovereign to
impart their
advice in all
matters of importance to the realm , either in time of par-
liament ,
or when
there is no parliament
in
being (6).
Accordingly, Bracton (c) , speaking of the nobility of his
time ,
says
they might probably
be called " consules , a
consulendo; reges
enim
tales
sibi associant ad consulen-
dum ."
And in our law books (d) , it is laid
down , that
peers
are created for two
reasons
:
1. Ad consulendum
, 2 .
Ad defendendum
regem : on which
account the law gives
them certain great and high privileges
: such as freedom
from arrest , &c. , even when no parliament
is sitting : be-
cause it intends , that they are always
assisting the sove-
reign with their counsel for the commonwealth , or keeping
the realm in safety by their prowess and valour .
Instances
of conventions
of the
peers , to
advise the
crown , were in former times frequent : though the practice

of convening
them
specially
for this
purpose
has fallen
into disuse , by reason ofthe more regular meetings of par-
liament .
Sir Edward
Coke (e) gives
us an extract of a
record , 5 Hen. 4 , concerning an exchange of lands between
the king
and the
earl of Northumberland
, wherein
the
value of each was agreed to be settled by advice of parlia-
ment (if any
should
be called
before the
feast of saint
Lucia),
or otherwise by advice of the grand
council
of
peers which the king promises to assemble before the said
feast, in case
no parliament
shall be called .
Other in-
stances
of this kind of meeting are to be found under our
ancient
kings : though this formal
method of convoking
the peers had been so long left off, that when king Charles
I. in 1640 , issued out writs
under the great seal
to call a
council of all the peers
of England to attend his majesty
at York , previous to the meeting of the long
parliament ,
the earl of Clarendon (f) mentions it as a new invention ,
not before heard of ; that
is , as he explains
himself, so
old , that it had not
been
practised in some hundreds of
years.
But though there had not
so long before been an
instance , nor
has there been
any
since ,
of assembling
them in so solemn a manner , yet in cases of emergency ,
our princes
have at several times thought
proper to call
for and consult
as many of the nobility as could easily be
got
together : as was
particularly
the
case
with king
James II. , after the landing of the prince of Orange ; and
with the prince of Orange himself, before he summoned
that convention parliament , which afterwards
called him
to the throne .
Besides this general
meeting , it has long
been looked
upon as the right of each particular
peer of the realm to
demand an
audience
of the sovereign , and , with decency
and respect , to make
an exposition
of such matters
as
may be judged
of importance to the public weal .
And
therefore , in the
reign
of Edward II. , it was made an
article
of impeachment
in parliament
against

large a number , that it was found inconvenient for secrecy
and
dispatch ; and
therefore
king
Charles II.
in
1679
limited it to thirty : whereof
fifteen were to be the prin-
cipal
officers of state , and counsellors
virtute officii ;
and
the
other
fifteen
were
composed of ten
lords
and five
commoners of the king's choosing (1) .
But since the time
of Charles II. the number of the privy council
has been
much augmented , and now continues indefinite .
Privy counsellors are made by the sovereign's nomina-
tion , without
either
patent or grant ; and , on taking
the
necessary oaths ,
they
become immediately
privy coun-
sellors during the life of the king who
chooses
them , but
subject to removal at his discretion .
Of these some few
only being
actually honoured with the
confidence of the
sovereign
are
summoned
to
attend
meetings
of the
council .
The " cabinet " (m) consists exclusively of mem-
bers of this high council ; to it the lord
president (n) of
the council invariably
belongs , and by it the government
of the country is conducted .
As to the qualifications of members to sit at this board ;
any natural -born subject of England is capable of being
a
member ofthe privy council on making
the declaration and
taking
the oath, respectively prescribed by 9 Geo. 4 , c . 17
and 21 & 22 Vict. c. 48.
However , in order to prevent
foreigners from insinuating
themselves into this important
trust , as happened in the reign of king William in many
instances , it was enacted by the act of settlement (o) , that no
person born out of the dominions of the crown of England ,

to the sovereign , by whom judgment
in the case
sub judice is finally given .
In regard to decisions of the ecclesiastical courts , except
such
as concern
testamentary
and matrimonial
causes ,
to decisions of the
admiralty
and vice-admiralty
courts ,
to orders of the Lord Chancellor in matters of lunacy or
idiocy (c) , being a special flower of the prerogative ; with
regard to these decisions
and
orders , although
they may
eventually involve questions of property , the privy council
has cognizance , being the court
of appeal in such cases
;
or rather , the appeal
lies to the sovereign in council .
Should
also a question arise between two
of our depen-
dencies concerning
the extent
of their charters
and the
like , the sovereign in
council
exercises
original jurisdic-
tion
therein ,
upon
the
principle
of feudal
sovereignty .
And so likewise
should
any person claim an island or a
province , in the nature of a feudal principality, by grant
from the crown , the determination
of that right belongs
to the sovereign in council : as in the
case of the earl of
Derby
with
regard to the Isle of Man in the
reign of
queen Elizabeth, and the earl of Cardigan
and others , as
representatives of the duke of Montague , with relation to
the island
of St.
Vincent in
1764.
Further , upon the
judicial committee of the privy council , has been imposed
by statutory
provisions
the
duty
of
adjudicating
upon
the lord chief
baron
of the Exche-
quer , the judges
of the
probate
court
and of the high court
of ad-
miralty, being members of the privy
council ; all members of the privy
council who
have held any of the
above offices ; and two other privy
counsellors
appointed
by the crown .
Of these
members
three (exclusive
of the lord president ) are required
to be present
at the
hearing of a
cause.
There
may also be two In-
dian assessors appointed
under

CHAPTER
VI.
THE
SOVEREIGN'S
DUTIES .
I PROCEED next to the duties incumbent on the sovereign
by our constitution
; in consideration of which
duties his
dignity and prerogative
are established by the laws of the
land : it being
a maxim in the law, that protection
and
subjection are reciprocal (a).
And these reciprocal duties
are what , I apprehend , were meant by the convention in
1688 , when
they declared king James had
broken
the
original
contract
between
king
and
people (b).
But
however , as the terms
of that
original contract were in
some measure disputed , being alleged to exist principally
in theory , and
to be only
deducible
by reason
and the
rules of natural
law ; in which deduction different under-
standings
might very
considerably
differ ; it
was ,
after
the
Revolution
, judged
proper
to
declare
these
duties
expressly , and to reduce that contract to a plain certainty .
So that whatever doubts might be formerly raised by en-
quiring and scrupulous minds
about the existence of such
an original contract , they must
now entirely
cease with
regard
to
every prince
who has reigned
since the year
1688 .
The principal duty of the sovereign is to govern his people
according to law.
Nec regibus infinita
aut libera potestas,
was the constitution
of
our
German
ancestors
on the
continent (c).
And this is
not
only consonant
to the
principles
of nature , of liberty , of reason , and of society ,

but has
always
been
esteemed
an
express
part
of the
common law of England,
even when
prerogative
was at
the highest. "The king ," says
Bracton (d) , who wrote
under Henry III. , " ought
not to be subject to man , but
to God , and to
the law ; for the law maketh
the king .
Let the king therefore render to
the law, what
the law
has invested in him with regard to others ; dominion
and
power : for he is not truly king , where will and pleasure
rules , and not the law."
And again (e), " the king also
hath a superior , namely God , and also the law, by which
he was
made a king ."
Thus
Bracton
:
and
Fortescue
also (f) ,
having
first
well
distinguished
between
a
monarchy
absolutely
and
despotically
regal ,
which
is
introduced
by conquest
and violence , and
a
political
or
civil
monarchy ,
which
arises
from
mutual consent
(of
which
last species
he asserts
the government
of England
to
be), immediately
lays it
down
as
a principle ,
that
" the king of England must
rule his people according
to
the
decrees
of the laws
thereof :
insomuch
that
he is
bound
by an oath
at his coronation
to the
observance
and
keeping
of his
own laws."
But , to
obviate
all
doubts
and
difficulties
concerning
this
matter ,
it was
expressly declared by statute
12
&
13 Wm . 3, c. 2 , that
" the
laws of England are the birthright of the
people
thereof ; and all
the kings
and
queens
who shall
ascend
the throne of this realm ought
to administer the govern-
ment of the same according
to the said
laws : and all
their officers and ministers
ought
to serve them respec-
tively according
to the same : and therefore all the laws
and
statutes of this
realm , for securing
the
established
religion , and the rights and liberties of the people thereof,
and all other laws and statutes of the same now in force ,
are ratified
and confirmed accordingly ."

terms of the the coronation oath , which by the statute 1 Wm. & M. st. 1 ,
c.
6, is to be administered
to every king and queen , who
shall
succeed
to the imperial
crown of these realms , by
one of the
archbishops
or bishops of the realm , in the
presence
of all the people ; who on their parts do recipro-
cally take the
oath
of allegiance
to the
crown .
This
coronation oath is conceived in the following
terms :
" The archbishop
or bishop shall say, Will you solemnly
promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of
England, and the dominions
thereto belonging , according
to the statutes in parliament
agreed on, and the laws and
customs
of the
same ?-The king or queen
shall
say, I
solemnly promise
so to do .—
Archbishop or bishop . Will
you to your power cause
law and justice , in mercy , to be
executed in all your judgments
?-King or queen . I wil .
--Archbishop
or
bishop .
Will
you to the
utmost
of
your
power
maintain
the laws of God , the true profes-
sion of the gospel , and the protestant
reformed
religion
established
by law?
And will
you
preserve unto
the
bishops
and
clergy of this realm , and to the
churches
committed
to their charge , all such rights
and privileges
as by law do
or
shall
appertain
unto
them ,
or
any of
them ?-King or
queen . All this I promise to do.-
After this the king or queen , laying his or her hand upon the
holy gospels, shall say, The things which I have here before
promised I will perform and keep : So help me God : and
then shall kiss the book."
This is the form of the coronation
oath , as it is now
prescribed by our laws ;
the
principal
articles of which
appear
to
be
at
least
as
ancient
as the
Mirror
of
Justices (g), and
even
as the time of Bracton (h) : but
the wording of it was changed at the Revolution
, because
(as the statute alleges) the
oath itself had
been
framed
in doubtful words and expressions , with relation
to ancient.
laws and constitutions

ever, in what form soever it be conceived , this
is most
indisputably
a fundamental
and original
express
contract ;
though
doubtless
the duty of protection
is impliedly as
much
incumbent
on the
sovereign
before coronation
as
after
in the
same
manner
as allegiance to the sovereign
becomes
the duty
of the
subject
immediately
on the
descent of the crown , before
he has taken
the
oath of
allegiance , or if he
should
never take it at all .
This
reciprocal
duty of the subject will be considered in its
proper place . At present we are only to observe , that in the
sovereign's part of this original
contract are expressed
all
the duties that a monarch can owe to his people : viz., to
govern
according to law ; to execute judgment
in mercy ;
and to maintain
the established
religion .
And with re-
spect to the latter of these three branches , we may further
remark :-

CHAPTER VII.
THE ROYAL PREROGATIVES
.
'It was observed in a former chapter (a), that one of the
principal bulwarks
of civil liberty ,
or
(in
other words )
of the
British
constitution , was
the limitation
of the
sovereign's
prerogative
by bounds
so
certain
and noto-
rious , that it is impossible
he should
ever exceed
them ,
without the consent of the
people ,
on the
one hand ; or
without, on the other , a violation of that original contract ,
which , in all states
impliedly , and in ours most expressly ,
subsists between the prince and the subject . It will now
be our business
to consider this prerogative minutely
; to
demonstrate its necessity in general ; and
to mark out in
the most
important
instances
its particular
extent and
restrictions
from
which considerations
this
conclusion
will evidently
follow, that the powers , which
are vested
in the crown by the laws of England ,
are
necessary
for
the support of society ; and do not trench any farther
on
our natural
than is expedient for the maintenance of our
civil liberties .
There cannot be a stronger proof of that genuine free-
dom , which is the boast of this age and country , than the
power
of discussing
and
examining
with
decency
and
respect , the limits of the sovereign's prerogative .
A topic ,
which in some former
ages was thought
too delicate and
sacred to be profaned
by the pen of a subject.
It was
ranked among the arcana imperii ; and, like the mysteries

THE
ROYAL
PREROGATIVES
.
Origin of the
royal prero-
gative.
of the bona dea , was not suffered
to be pried into by any but
such as were initiated
in its service : because
perhaps the
exertion
of the
one , like the
solemnities
of the other ,
would
not
bear
the inspection
of a rational
and
sober
inquiry.
The glorious
queen
Elizabeth herself
made no
scruple to direct her parliaments
to abstain from discours-
ing of matters
of state ( b) ;
and it was the
constant
language of this favourite princess and her ministers , that
even that august assembly " ought not to deal,
to judge ,
or to meddle with her majesty's
prerogative
royal ” (c ) .
And her successor, king James I. , who had imbibed high
notions of the divinity of regal sway, more than once laid
it down in his
speeches , that "as it is atheism and blas-
phemy in a creature to dispute what the Deity
may do, so
it is presumption
and sedition in a subject to dispute what
a king may do in the height of his power : good christians
(he adds) will be content with God's will , revealed in his
word ;
and
good
subjects will
rest in the king's will ,
revealed in his law" (d).
But, whatever might be the sentiments of some of our
princes , this was never the language of our ancient con-
stitution and laws .
The limitation of the regal authority
was
a first
and
essential
principle
in all the
Gothic
systems of government
established
in
Europe ; though
gradually
driven
out
and
overborne,
by violence
and
chicane , in most of the
kingdoms
on the continent (e).
We have seen , in the preceding
chapter , the sentiments
hereon of Bracton
and Fortescue , at the distance of two
centuries from
each
other .
And Sir Henry Finch , under
Charles I. , after the lapse of two centuries more , though
he lays down the law of prerogative
in very strong and
emphatical terms , yet qualifies it with
a general restric-
tion , in regard to the liberties of the people .
" The king
hath a prerogative in all things that
are not injurious to

the subject
for in them all it must be remembered , that
the king's prerogative stretcheth not to the doing
of any
wrong " (f).
Nihil
enim aliud potest
rex , nisi id solum
quod de jure potest (g).
And here we may remark , how
widely the civil law differs
from
our own , with regard to
the authority
of the laws over the prince , or (as a civilian
would
rather
have
expressed it) the
authority of the
prince over the laws .
It is a maxim of the English law ,
as we have seen from Bracton , that " rex debet esse sub lege,
quia lex facit
regem ; " the imperial law will tell us , that ,
"in omnibus imperatoris
excipitur fortuna ; cui ipsas leges
Deus subjecit " (h).
We shall not long hesitate to which
of them to give the preference , as most conducive to those
ends for which societies were framed , and
are kept toge-
ther ; especially
as the Roman
lawyers
themselves
seem
to be sensible of the unreasonableness of their own consti-
tution . " Decet tamen principem ," says Paulus, " servare
leges, quibus ipse solutus est " (i) .
This is at
once
laying
down the principle
of despotic
power ,
and at the
same
time acknowledging
its absurdity .
of preroga
By the word " prerogative "
we usually understand
Etymology
that special pre-eminence , which
the king has , over
and tive.
above all other persons, and out of the ordinary
course of
the common law , in right of his regal dignity.
It signi-
fies , in
its
etymology
(
from prae and rogo
)
something that
is
required
or
demanded before
,
or
in
preference
to
,
all
others
(
).
And hence
it
follows
,
that
it
must
be
in
its
nature
singular
and
eccentrical
:
that
it
can only be
applied
to
those
rights
and
capacities
which
the king
enjoys
alone
,
in
contradistinction
to
others
,
and
not
to
those which
he
enjoys
in
common with any
of
his

THE ROYAL PREROGATIVES
.
Prerogatives
are either
direct,
or inci-
dental.
Direct pre-
rogatives re-
late to the
royal cha-
racter, au
thority or
income,
jects ; for if once any one
prerogative of the crown could
be
held
in
common
with
the
subject , it would
cease
to
be prerogative
any
longer .
And
therefore
Finch (1)
lays it down
as a maxim , that the
prerogative
is that
law in case of the king , which is law in no
case of the
subject .
Prerogatives
are either direct or incidental .
The direct
are such positive
substantial
parts of the royal character
and authority , as are rooted in and spring from the sove-
reign's political
person , considered merely by itself, with-
out reference to any other extrinsic
circumstance : as , the
right of sending
ambassadors , of creating
peers , and of
making war or peace .
But such prerogatives
as are inci-
dental bear always a relation
to something
else , distinct
from the sovereign's person ; and
are
indeed only excep-
tions , in favour of the crown , to those general rules that are
established for the rest of the community : such as , that
an action will not lie against the king ; that the king can
never be a joint tenant ; that
his
debt shall
be preferred
before a debt owing to any of his subjects .
These and an
infinite
number of other
instances , will better be under-
stood , when
we
come
regularly
to
consider
the
rules
themselves , to which these
incidental
prerogatives
are
exceptions .
And therefore we will at present only dwell
upon the sovereign's substantive or direct prerogatives .
These substantive
or direct
prerogatives
may again be
divided into three kinds : being
such as regard , first , the
sovereign's royal character ; secondly , his royal authority ;
and , lastly , his royal income .
These are necessary
, to secure
reverence to his person , obedience to his
commands , and
an affluent
supply
for the ordinary
expenses
of govern-
ment , without
all of which it is impossible
to maintain
the executive power in due independence and vigour .
Yet
in every branch of this large and extensive dominion , our
free constitution
has interposed
such
reasonable
checks

liberties , which it was meant to secure and establish .
The
enormous
weight of prerogative , if left to itself
( as in
arbitrary
governments it is), threatens
every moment to
spread havoc and destruction among all the inferior move-
ments ; but when balanced and regulated (as with us) by
its proper counterpoise , timely and judiciously
applied , its
operations
are
equable
and certain ; it invigorates
the
whole machine , and enables
every part to answer the end
of its construction .
In the present chapter we shall only consider the two first
of these divisions , which relate to the sovereign's political
character
and authority
; or, in other words , his dignity
and regal power ; to which last the name of prerogative is
frequently
narrowed
and
confined .
The
other division ,
which
forms the
royal
revenue , will
require
a distinct
examination
; according to the known distribution
of the
feudal writers , who distinguish the royal prerogatives into
the
majora
and
minora
regalia , in
the latter of which
classes
the rights of the revenue are ranked .
For , to use
their own words , " majora regalia imperii præ- eminentiam
spectant; minora vero ad commodum pecuniarium immediate
attinent ;

hæc proprie fiscalia sunt, et ad jus fisci per-
tinent " (m).

to consider their prince
as a man of no greater

The
law therefore
ascribes to the sovereign , in his high poli-
tical
character , not only
large
powers and
emoluments ,
which form
his
prerogative
and
revenue, but
likewise
certain attributes of a great and transcendent
nature ; by
which the people
are
led to consider
him with
special
reverence, and to pay him that respect, which may
en-
able him with greater
ease to carry on the business of
government .
This is
what I
understand
by the royal
dignity , the several branches of which
we will now pro-
ceed to examine .
I. The law ascribes to the wearer of the crown the attri-
bute of sovereignty or pre-eminence.
" Rex est vicarius ,"
says Bracton (n) , " et minister Dei in terrâ : omnis
quidem
sub eo est, et ipse sub nullo , nisi tantum sub Deo " (o). He is
said to have imperial
dignity
; and in charters before the
Conquest is frequently
styled
basileus
and imperator , the
titles
respectively
assumed by the emperors of the east
and west ( p).
His
realm
is declared to be an empire ,
and his crown imperial , by many acts of parliament , par-
ticularly

both
civil
and
ecclesiastical ,
and of consequence inferior to
no
man
upon
earth,
dependent
on no
man , account-
able to no man .
Formerly there prevailed
a ridiculous
notion , propagated by the German
and Italian civilians ,
that an
emperor
could
do
some things
which
a king
could
not
(as
the creation of notaries
and
the like) ,
and that all kings were in some degree subordinate and

and
applies
them to the
realm
and crown of England , is only to assert that our
monarch is equally sovereign and independent within these
his dominions , as any emperor is in his
empire (r) , and
owes
no kind of subjection
to any other potentate upon
earth (s).
Hence it is , that no suit
or
action
can be
brought
against the sovereign , even
in civil matters , be-
cause no court can have jurisdiction over him.
For all
jurisdiction implies
superiority of power : authority
to try
would
be vain and idle , without
an authority
to redress
;
and the sentence
of a court will be contemptible , unless
that
court
has power to command
the execution
of it :
but
who ,
says
Finch (t),
shall
command
the
king?
Hence it is , likewise , that by law the person of the king
is sacred, even
though the measures
pursued
in his reign
be completely tyrannical
and arbitrary
:
for
no jurisdic-
tion upon earth has power to try him in a criminal
way ;
much less to condemn him to punishment .
If any fo-
reign jurisdiction had this power , as was formerly claimed
by the pope , the independence of the kingdom would be no
more
and if such a power were
vested
in any domestic
tribunal, there would
soon be an end of the constitution ,
by destroying
the free agency of one of the
constituent
parts of the sovereign legislative
power .

by punish-
ment of
matter of grace, though
not upon compulsion (u) ) will be
done.
And this is entirely
consonant to what is laid down
by writers
on natural
law.
" A subject ,"
says
Puffen-
dorf (x), " so long
as he continues a subject , hath no way
to oblige his prince to give him his due, when he refuses
it, though
no wise prince will
ever
refuse to stand to a
lawful
contract ."
If,
however , the
sovereign
gives his
subject leave to bring an action
against him, upon such
contract , in his own
court , the action itself
proceeds
in
accordance with the rules of our municipal
law, and has
by a recent statute (y) been very closely assimilated
to an
ordinary
suit.
Although the
end of such
action is in
theory not to compel the prince
to
observe
the contract ,
but to persuade him to do so.
As to personal wrongs ; it
is well observed by Mr. Locke (z)—" the harm which the
sovereign
can do in his own person
not being likely to
happen often , nor to extend itself far ; nor being able, by
his single strength , to subvert the laws , nor
oppress
the
body
of the people (should
any
prince
have
so
much
weakness
and
ill
-
nature
as
to

to
do
it
),
—
the
inconveniency
therefore
of
some particular
mischiefs
,
that
may happen sometimes
,
when
a
heady prince comes
to
the
throne
,
are well recompensed by the peace
of
the public
and security
of
the government
,
in
the person
of
the chief
magistrate being thus set out
of
the reach
of
danger
."
Next
,
in
cases
of
ordinary public
oppression
,
where the
oppression
vitals of the
constitution
are not
attacked
,
the law has
ministers

also assigned

For
as

without

counsellors
,
and the
assistance
of

,
these
men
may
be

in contradiction to the laws of the land.
But it is at the
same time a maxim in those laws , that the king himself
can do no wrong : since it would
be a great weakness and
absurdity
in any
system of positive
law to
define any
possible wrong , without any possible redress .
For , as to such public
oppressions
as tend to dissolve
the constitution , and subvert the fundamentals
of govern-
ment , they are cases which the law will not , out of decency ,
suppose
being
incapable of distrusting
those , whom
it
has invested with any part of the supreme power ; since
such
distrust
would
render
the
exercise of that power
precarious
and impracticable (a).
For wherever the law
expresses
its
distrust
of
abuse
of
power
,
it
always vests
a
superior
coercive authority
in
some other hand
to
correct
it
;
the very notion
of
which destroys the idea
of
sovereignty
.
If
therefore
(
for example
)
the two houses
of
parliament
,
or
either
of
them
,
had avowedly
a
right
to
animadvert
on the sovereign
,
or
each
other
,
or
if
the sovereign had
a
right
to
animadvert
on either
of
the houses
,
that branch
of the legislature
,
so
subject
to
animadversion
,
would soon
cease
to
be part
of
the supreme power
;
the balance
of
the
constitution
would
be
overturned
;
and the
branch
or
branches
,
in
which this jurisdiction resided
,
would become
completely paramount
.
The supposition
of
law therefore
is,
that
neither the sovereign nor either
house
of
parlia-
ment
is(
subject
to
some former observations
(b))
capable
of
doing any wrong
;
since
in
such
a
case the law might feel
itself incapable
of
furnishing
any adequate
and satisfactory
remedy
.
For which reason all oppressions
,
which
may
happen
to
spring from any branch
of
the sovereign power
,
must necessarily be out
of
the reach
of
any stated
rule
or
express
legal
provision
;
but
,
if
ever they unfortunately
happen
,
the
prudence of the
times
must
provide
new
remedies upon new emergencies
.

(II.) Abso-
lute
perfec-
tion.
Indeed , it is found , by experience , that
whenever un-
constitutional
oppressions , even of the
sovereign
power ,
advance with gigantic
strides , and threaten desolation to
a state, mankind
will not be reasoned out of the feelings
of humanity
; nor will sacrifice
their
liberty by a scrupu-
lous
adherence
to
those political
maxims , which
were
originally
established
to
preserve it.
And
therefore ,
though
the positive
laws
are silent
upon this
subject ,
experience will furnish us with
a very remarkable
case
pertinent
to it,
wherein
nature
and
reason
prevailed .
When king James II. invaded
the fundamental
consti-
tution of the realm , the convention declared an abdication ,
whereby the throne was rendered vacant , which induced
a
new
settlement of the
crown .
And irrespective of this
precedent ( c) , if any prince should
hereafter endeavour to
subvert the constitution
by breaking
the original
contract
between sovereign and people , and by violating
the funda-
mental
laws , we cannot doubt
that
future
generations ,
necessity , and the safety of the body politic thus requiring
it, will exert those inherent
(though latent ) powers of
society, which no climate , no time ,
no
constitution ,
no
contract can ever destroy or diminish .
II.
Besides the attribute
of sovereignty , the law also
ascribes to the sovereign , in his or her political capacity ,
absolute
perfection .
" The
king
can
do
no
wrong ."
Which ancient
and fundamental
maxim is not to be un-
derstood , as if everything
transacted by the government
was of course just and lawful , but means only two things .
First , that whatever
is
exceptionable
in the
conduct of
public affairs is not to be imputed
to the king , nor is he
answerable for it personally
to his people : for this doc-
trine would
totally destroy that
constitutional
independ-
ence of the crown , which is necessary for the balance of
power in our free and active , and therefore
compounded ,
constitution .
And ,
secondly , it means that the
prero-

THE

PERFECTION

gative of the crown extends not to do any injury ; it was
created for the benefit of the people , and therefore cannot
be exerted to their prejudice (d).
The sovereign , moreover , is not only incapable of doing
wrong , but even of thinking wrong ; he can never mean
to do an improper
thing : in him is no folly or weakness .
And therefore if the crown should be induced to grant any
franchise or privilege
to a subject
contrary
to reason , or
in any wise prejudicial
to the commonwealth , or to a pri-
vate person , the law will not suppose the sovereign to have
meant
either
an unwise or an
injurious
action , but
de-
clares that he was deceived in his grant ; and thereupon
such grant is rendered void , merely upon the foundation
of fraud and deception
either by or upon
those
agents
whom the crown has thought
proper
to employ .
For the
law will not cast an imputation
on that magistrate
whom
it intrusts with the executive power , as if he was capable
of intentionally disregarding
his trust : but attributes
to
mere imposition
(to which the most perfect of sublunary
beings
must
still
continue liable )
these little inadvert-
encies , which , if charged on the will of the prince , might
lessen him in the eyes of his subjects .

has
allowed
a latitude
of supposing
the
contrary , in
respect to both
houses
of parliament :
each of which , in
its turn, has exerted the right of remonstrating
and com-
plaining to the
sovereign even of those acts
of royalty ,
which are most properly and personally his own ; such as
messages
signed by himself, and speeches
delivered
from
the throne .
And yet , such is the reverence
which is paid
to the royal
person , that though
the two houses have an
undoubted right to consider
these
acts

any
light
whatever ,
and
accordingly

THE ROYAL PREROGATIVES

No laches

among themselves (to preserve the more perfect
decency,
and
for the
greater
freedom of
debate )
they
usually
suppose them to flow from the
advice of the
adminis-
tration .
But the privilege
of canvassing
thus
freely the
personal
acts of the
sovereign
(either
directly , or
even
through
the
medium
of his reputed advisers ) belongs to
no individual, but is confined
to those august assemblies ;
and there too the objections
must
be proposed with the
utmost
respect and deference.
One member was sent to
the tower (e) , for suggesting
that his majesty's answer to
the address of the commons
contained
" high words to
fright the members out of their duty ; " and another (ƒ) ,
for saying
that
a part
of the
king's speech " seemed
rather to be calculated for the meridian of Germany than
Great
Britain , and that the king was a stranger
to our
language and constitution ."
In further
pursuance
of this principle , the
law also
imputed to
determines that in the
sovereign can be no negligence , or
laches , and therefore no delay will bar his right.

has (with
certain
exceptions (g) )
been the
standing
maxim : for the law intends
that the
king is always busied for the public
good , and
therefore
has not leisure to assert his right within the times limited
to subjects (h).
In the king
also can be no stain
or
corruption
of blood : for if the
heir to the crown were
attainted
of treason or felony , and
afterwards
the crown
should
descend
to him , this would
purge
the
attainder
ipso facto (i) .
And
therefore when Henry VII. , who
as
earl of Richmond
stood attainted , came to the crown , it
was not thought
necessary to pass
an act of parliament
to
reverse this
attainder
;

informs us, it was agreed that the
assumption
of the
crown
had at once
purged
all
attainders .
Neither
can
the king in judgment
of law, as king, ever be a minor or
under age ; and therefore his royal
grants and assents to
acts of parliament
are good, though
he has
not in his
natural capacity attained the legal age of twenty -one ( 1) .
By a statute
indeed , 28 Hen. 8 , c. 17 , power
was
given
to future
kings
to rescind and revoke all acts of parlia-
ment made while they were under the age of twenty -four :
but this was repealed by the
statute
1 Edw. 6 , c.
11 , so
far
as
related
to
that
prince ;
and
both
statutes
are
declared
to be determined
by 24
Geo. 2 , c. 24.
It has
also been usually thought prudent when the heir apparent
has
been very young , to appoint
a protector , guardian , or
regent, for a limited
time : but the very necessity of such
extraordinary
provision
is
sufficient
to demonstrate
the
truth of the maxim of the common law, that in the king
is no minority : he has therefore no legal guardian
(m).
(7) Co. Litt. 43 ; 2 Inst . pref . 3.
(m) The
methods
of appointing
this
guardian
or regent have been
so various , and the
duration
of his
power so uncertain , that from hence
alone it may be collected
that
his
office is unknown
to the common
law ; and
therefore
(as sir Edward
Coke
says , 4 Inst . 58) the
surest
way is to have him made by autho-
rity of the great
council
in parlia
ment .
The
earl of Pembroke , by
his own authority , assumed in very
troublesome
times
the regency of
Henry III ., who was then only nine
years old ; but was declared of full
age by the pope
at seventeen , con-
firmed the great charter at eighteen ,
and took upon him the
administra-
tion of the government
at twenty .
A guardian
and council
of regency
were named for Edward III . by the
parliament ,
which
deposed
his
father ; the young king being then
fifteen ,
and
not
assuming
the
government
till
three
years
after .
When Richard II . succeeded at the
age of eleven , the duke of Lancas-
ter took upon him the management
of the kingdom , till the parliament
met , which
appointed
a nominal
council to assist
him.
Henry V.
on
his
death -bed
named
a regent
and
a guardian
for his
infant son
Henry VI., then nine months
old ;
but the parliament
altered
his
dis-
position , and
appointed
a protector
and
council , with a special
limited
authority .
Both these last -named
princes remained in a state of pupi-
lage till the
age of twenty -three .
Edward
V.
at the
age of thirteen
was
recommended
by his father to
the care of the duke of Gloucester ;

III . A third
attribute
of
regal majesty is perpetuity .
The law ascribes
to the sovereign , in his political
capacity ,
an
absolute immortality.
Rex nunquam moritur , " The
king never dies."
Henry, Edward, or George may die ;
but the king survives
them all.
For immediately
upon
the decease of the reigning
prince in his natural
capacity ,
his kingship or imperial
dignity by act of law, without
any interregnum or interval , is vested at
once in his heir;
who is, eo instante, king to all intents and purposes .
And
so tender is the law of supposing even a possibility
of his

the executive part of government .
This is wisely placed

sovereignis power , when I lay it down
as
a principle, that , in the
exercise of lawful
prerogative , the sovereign is and ought
to be absolute ; that
is, so far absolute , that
there is no
legal authority
which
can
either delay or resist him.
He
may reject what bills , may make what
treaties , may coin
what
money , may create what
peers , may pardon
what
offences
he
pleases , may in short discharge any functions
vested exclusively in him as sovereign ; unless where the
constitution
has expressly , or by evident consequence
, laid
down some exception
or boundary : declaring , that
thus
far the prerogative shall go, and no farther .
For other-
wise the power of the crown would
indeed
be but a name
and a shadow, insufficient
for the ends of government , if,
where its jurisdiction is clearly established
and allowed ,
any man or body of men were permitted
to disobey it , in
the ordinary course of law : I say, in the ordinary
course
of law ; for I do not now speak of those
extraordinary
recourses to first principles , which are necessary when the
contracts of society are in danger of dissolution , and the
law proves too weak
a defence against the violence of
fraud
or oppression .
And yet the want of attending
to
so obvious a distinction
has
occasioned
these doctrines , of
absolute power in the prince and of national
resistance by
the people, to be much
misunderstood
and perverted , by
the advocates for slavery on the one hand , and the dema-
gogues of faction on the other.
The former observing the
absolute
sovereignty
and
transcendent
dominion
of the
crown laid down
(as it certainly
is)
most
strongly
and
emphatically in some of our law books , as well
as in our
homilies , have denied that any case can be excepted
from
so general and positive
a rule , forgetting
how impossible
it is , in any practical
system of laws , to point out before-
hand those eccentrical
remedies , which
the sudden emer-
gence of national
distress
may dictate , and which
that
alone
can
justify .
On the
other
hand ,

republicans , feeling
the
absurdity
of unlimited
passive
obedience, have fancifully (or sometimes factiously ) gone
over to the
other
extreme :
and ,
because
resistance is
justifiable to the person of the prince when the being of
the
state is endangered , and the
public voice proclaims
such resistance
necessary, they have therefore allowed to
every individual the right of determining this expedience ,
and of employing
private
force
to
resist
even
private
oppression .
A doctrine
productive
of anarchy ,
and (in
consequence ) equally fatal to civil liberty as tyranny itself.
For civil liberty, rightly understood , can exist only where
the rights of individuals
are protected by the united force
of society : society cannot be maintained , and of course
can
exert no protection , without
obedience
to some
sovereign.
power
and
obedience
is an empty name , if every indi-
vidual
has a right to decide how far he himself
shall
obey .
In the exercise therefore of those
prerogatives , which
the law has given
him, the sovereign is irresistible
and
absolute , according to the forms of the constitution .
And
yet , if the consequence
of that
exertion
be manifestly
to
the grievance or dishonour of the kingdom , the parliament
will call
his advisers to a just and
severe
account .
For
prerogative
consisting (as Mr. Locke (g) has well
defined
it) in the
discretionary
power of acting
for
the
public
good , where the positive
laws
are
silent ; if that
dis-
cretionary
power be abused to the public detriment , such
prerogative
is
exerted
in
an
unconstitutional
manner .
Thus
the
sovereign
may make
a
treaty with a foreign
state , which
shall
irrevocably
bind
the nation
; and yet
when such treaties have been judged
pernicious , impeach-
ments have pursued
those ministers , by whose agency or
advice they were concluded .
The prerogatives of the crown (in the sense under which
we are now considering
them ) respect either this nation's

that the individuals
of a state , in their collective capacity ,
can transact
the affairs
of that
state with another com-
munity equally
numerous
as
themselves .
Unanimity

to their measures , and strength to the
execution of their

In the sovereign therefore ,
as in a centre , all the rays of his people are united , and

a consistency ,

What is done by the royal authority ,
with regard
to foreign
powers , is the
act of the whole
nation : what is done without the sovereign's concurrence ,
is the act only of private
men .
And so far is this point
carried by our law, that it has been held (r) , that should
all the
subjects
of England make
war with a king in
league with the king of England , without
the royal assent ,
such war is no breach of the league .
Also , by the statute
2 Hen. 5 , c. 6 , a subject committing
acts of hostility
upon
any nation in league with the king was declared to be
guilty of high treason : and though that act was repealed
by statute 20 Hen. 6, c. 11 , so far as relates to the making
this offence high treason , yet still it remains a very great
offence
against the law of nations , and punishable
by our
laws .

The rights , the powers , the
duties , and the privileges
Their privi-
of ambassadors
are determined
by the law of nature
and
nations , not by any municipal
constitutions .
For ,
as
ambassadors
represent
the
persons
of their
respective
masters , who can owe no subjection to any laws but those
of their own country , their actions are not subject to the
control of the private
law of that state wherein they are
appointed
to reside .
He who is subject to the coercion
of laws is necessarily dependent on that power by which
those laws were made : but an ambassador ought to be inde-
pendent of every power , except
that by which he is sent ;
and of consequence ought
not to be subject to the mere
municipal
laws of that nation wherein he is to exercise
his
functions . If he grossly
offends , or makes an
ill
use
of
his character
,
he may be sent home
and
accused
before
his master
(t),
who
is
bound
either
to
do
justice
upon
him
,
or
to
avow himself the accomplice
of
his crimes
(u).
But there
is
great dispute
among writers on the laws
of
nations
,
whether
this
exemption
of
ambassadors extends
to
all
crimes
,
as
well natural
as
positive
;
or
whether
it
only extends

as

that

reason and
nature ,
he
shall
lose his
privilege
( ≈) ; and
that
therefore , if an
ambassador
conspires
the
death of
the king in whose land
he is , he may be condemned and
executed for treason ; but if he commits any other species
of treason, it is otherwise , and he must be sent to his own
kingdom (a) .
And these propositions
might seem to be
built
upon good
appearance
of reason .
For
since
all
municipal
laws act in subordination
to the primary law of
nature , and, where they
annex a punishment
to natural
crimes ,
are
declaratory
of
and
auxiliary to that
law ;
therefore to this natural universal
rule of justice ambassa-
dors , as well
as other men , are subject in all countries
:
and
of
consequence
it might
appear
reasonable
that ,
wherever they transgress it, they should be liable to make
atonement (6).
But,
however
these
principles
might
formerly obtain , the general
practice
of this
country , as
well as of the rest of Europe ,
seems
now to pursue the
sentiments
of the
learned Grotius, that the
security
of
ambassadors is of more importance than the punishment
of a particular
crime (c).
And
therefore few, if any,
examples have happened within two centuries past , where
an ambassador has been punished for any offence , however
atrocious in its nature (d).
In respect
to civil suits , jurists
agree , that neither an
ambassador , nor any of his train
or
comites , can be pro-
secuted for a debt or contract in the courts of that king-
dom wherein
he is sent to reside.
Yet sir Edward Coke
maintains , that if an ambassador make a contract which
is good , jure gentium , he shall answer for it here (e) .
But
the truth is , so few
cases
(if any) had arisen , wherein

the privilege
was
either
claimed
or disputed ,
even with
regard
to civil suits , that our law-books are (in general )
quite silent upon it previous to the reign of queen Anne ;
when
an ambassador
from
Peter
the Great, czar of
Muscovy , was actually
arrested and taken out of his coach.
in London (f) , for a debt of fifty pounds which
he had
there
contracted .
Instead of applying
to be discharged
upon
his
privilege , he gave bail to the action , and the
next day complained
to the
queen .
The
persons who
were concerned in the
arrest
were examined
before the
privy council (of which the lord chief justice Holt was at
the same time sworn
a member (g) ) , and
seventeen
were
committed
to prison (h) ; most of whom
were prosecuted
by information
in the court
of queen's bench , at the suit
of the attorney general ( ) , and
at their trial before the
lord
chief justice
were
convicted
of the
facts by the
jury (k), the question
of law,
how far those facts were
criminal , being reserved , to be afterwards
argued before
the
judges ;
which question
was never formally deter-
mined ().
In the mean
time
the
czar
resented
this
affront
very highly,
and
demanded that the
sheriff
of
Middlesex
and all
others
concerned in the arrest should
be punished
with instant
death (m).
But the queen
(to
the amazement of that
despotic
sovereign ) directed
her
secretary
to
inform
him , " that she
could
inflict
no
punishment
upon
any ,
the
meanest ,
of her
subjects ,
unless warranted
by the law of the land
; and therefore

ties " (n).
To satisfy however the clamours of the foreign
ministers (who
made it a common
cause ) as well as to
appease
the
wrath
of
Peter ,
a bill
was
brought
into
parliament (o) , and
afterwards
passed
into a law (p) , to
prevent
and
punish
such
outrageous
insolence
for the
future .
And with a copy of this act, elegantly engrossed
and illuminated
, accompanied by a letter from the queen ,
an ambassador
extraordinary (9) was
commissioned
to
appear
at Moscow (r), who
declared, " that though
her
majesty
could
not
inflict
such
a punishment
as
was
required , because
of the defect in that particular
of the
former established constitutions
of her kingdom , yet with
the unanimous
consent of the parliament , she had caused
a new act to be passed , to serve
as a law for the future . "
This humiliating step was accepted
as
a full
satisfaction
by the czar
and the offenders , at his
request , were dis-
charged from all further prosecution .
The statute (8) passed on the above
occasion recites the
arrest which had
been
made , " in contempt
of the pro-
tection
granted
by her majesty ,
contrary
to the law of
nations , and in
prejudice
of the rights
and
privileges ,
which ambassadors and other public ministers , authorized
and received as such , have at all times been thereby pos-
sessed of, and ought
to be kept
sacred
and inviolable
: ”
wherefore it enacts, that for the future all process whereby
the
person of any ambassador , or of his " domestic
or
domestic
servant "
may be
arrested ,
or his goods dis-
trained or seized , shall be utterly null and void : and the
persons prosecuting , soliciting , or executing
such process ,
shall be deemed
violators of the law of nations , and dis-
turbers of the public
repose
; and shall suffer such penal-
ties and corporal
punishment
as the lord chancellor and
the chiefjustices , or any two of them , shall judge

THE
ROYAL
PREROGATIVES
.
(III.) In
making war
a league , that it be made by the sovereign power (z) : and
then it is binding upon the whole
community
: and
in
England the sovereign power , quoad hoc , is vested
in the
person of the monarch .
Whatever
contracts therefore he
engages
in , no other power in the kingdom can legally
delay , resist , or annul .
And yet , lest this plenitude
of
authority
should be abused
to the detriment of the public,
the constitution (as was hinted before) has here interposed
a check , by the means of parliamentary
impeachment , for
the punishment of such ministers
as from criminal
mo-
tives advise or conclude any treaty , which shall afterwards
be judged
to derogate from the honour and interest of the
nation .
III .
Upon the same principle
the sovereign has also
and peace.
the sole prerogative of making war and peace .
For it is
held by writers
on the law of nature and nations , that the
right of making
war , which by nature
subsisted in every
individual, is given up by all private
persons who enter
into society, and is vested in the sovereign power (a) : and
this right
is given
up , not only by individuals
, but even
by the entire body of people , who are under the dominion
of a sovereign .
It would
indeed be extremely improper ,
that
any number of subjects should
have
the
power of
binding
the supreme magistrate , and putting
him against
his will in a state of war .
Whatever
hostilities
therefore

made,
wherever they
happen to be
found .
And
indeed
this
custom of reprisal
seems
dictated by nature
herself ; for
which
reason
we find in the most
ancient
times
very
notable
instances of it (e).
But
here the
necessity is
obvious of calling
in the sovereign
power , to determine
when reprisals may be made (ƒ) ;
else
every
private
suf-
ferer would
be a judge in his own cause .
In pursuance
of which
principle , it was declared by statute 4 Hen . 5 ,
c. 7, that if subjects of the
realm
are
oppressed
in
the
time of truce by foreigners , the king will grant marque in
due form , to all who feel themselves aggrieved .
Which
form is thus directed
to be observed : the sufferer must
first apply to the lord privy-seal : and he shall make out
letters of request under the privy - seal
: and if, after
such
request of satisfaction
made, the
party
required
do
not
within a convenient time make due satisfaction
or restitu-
tion to the party grieved , the lord chancellor
shall
make
him
out letters of marque
under
the great
seal
; and by
virtue of these he may attack
and seize the property of
the aggressor nation , without
hazard of being condemned
as a robber or pirate .
The granting
of letters of marque , however , under
the
above statute of Henry V. was limited
to persons actually
aggrieved , and has long been discontinued .

as a satisfaction
for
a prize won at
the Elian games by his father Neleus ,
and for debts due to many private

enemy's ship , the prize
belongs not to the captor but to the sovereign (g) ; where-
fore, with a view to encourage merchants and others to fit
out armed ships in time of war , the admiralty
has been
empowered (h) to grant commissions
to private
persons ,
fitting out such ships called privateers , entitling
them to
special
advantages .
Under
these
commissions
all the
prizes captured are to be divided according to the contract
entered
into between the
owners and the master and the
crew of the privateer .
But the owners , before such com-
missions are granted , are required to give security to the
admiralty
to make compensation for injuries
committed
against
those
powers
with
whom
the

ships shall not be employed in smuggling

or compassion .
Great
tenderness
is shown by our laws ,
not only to foreigners in distress (as will appear when
we
come to speak of shipwrecks ) , but with regard also to the
admission
into
the realm of strangers
who
come hither
spontaneously .
For so long
as their nation
continues
at
peace with ours , and they themselves
behave
peaceably ,
they are
under the sovereign's
protection
; though liable
to be sent home if occasion for thus exerting the preroga-
tive should arise .
But no subject of a nation at war with
us can, by the law of nations , come
into the realm , nor
travel
upon the high seas , nor
send his goods and mer-
chandize
from
one
place to another , without
danger
of
being seized by our subjects , unless he has letters of safe-
conduct ; which under
divers
ancient
statutes (n) were
granted by the king's seal and enrolled in chancery , or else
were of no effect : the king being supposed
the best judge
of such emergencies , as may
deserve
exemption from the
general law of arms.
But passports under the sovereign's
sign -manual , or licences from his ambassadors abroad , are
now more usually
obtained , and are allowed to be of equal
validity.
The
residence of aliens
in this country is re-
gulated by the statute law (o).
The law of England, as a commercial
country , pays a
very particular
regard
to foreign
merchants , in innumer-
able
instances , of which
one
especially
deserves
notice .
By
magna carta (p) it is provided
that all merchants.
(unless publicly
prohibited
beforehand ) shall
have safe-
conduct to depart from , to come into , to tarry in , and to go
through England , for the
exercise of merchandize , with-
out any unreasonable imposts , except in time of war : and
if a war breaks
out between us and their country , they
shall be attached (if in England) without harm of body or
goods, till the king or his chief justiciary be informed how
our merchants
are treated in the land with which we are

at war; and, if ours be secure in that land , they shall be
secure in ours.
This
seems
to have been a common rule
of equity among the northern
nations ; for we learn from
Stiernhook (q), that it was a maxim
among the Goths
and Swedes , quam legem exteri nobis posuere,
eandem illis
ponemus.
But it is somewhat extraordinary
that this rule
should have found a place in magna carta , a mere
interior
treaty
between
the king and
his natural -born
subjects :
which occasions the learned
Montesquieu
to remark with
a degree of admiration , " that the English have made the
protection
of foreign merchants one of the articles of their
national liberty " (r).
It well justifies
indeed
another
observation
which he has made (s) , " that the English
know better
than
any
other people
upon
earth , how to
value at the same time these three great advantages , reli-
gion , liberty,
and
commerce."
Very
different from the
genius of the Roman people ; who in their manners , their
constitution , and even in their laws , treated commerce as
a dishonourable
employment , and
prohibited
the exercise
thereof to persons of birth,
or rank , or fortune (t) : and
equally
different
from the bigotry of the canonists , who
looked
on trade
as inconsistent with christianity
( u) , and
determined at the council of Melfi , under
pope Urban II.

1090, that it was impossible
with a safe conscience
to exercise any traffic , or to follow the profession of the

THE

(I.) The
sovereignisa
part of the
sentative of his people .
As regards domestic affairs he is
also considered in a great variety of characters , and hence
there arises an abundant number of other prerogatives .
I. The
sovereign is a constituent
part of the supreme
constituent legislative
power ; and ,
as such, has the prerogative of
legislature. rejecting
such
provisions
in
parliament ,
as
he judges
improper
to be
passed .
The
expediency
of this
con-
stitution
has
already
been
evinced at large (y), and in
connection with it I shall only further
remark , that the
sovereign
is
not bound by any act of parliament , unless
he be named
therein
by special
and
particular
words .
The most
general
words
that
can be
devised (" any
person
or
persons ,
bodies
politic
or
corporate ,
&c.")
affect not him in the least , if they may tend to restrain
or diminish
any of his rights or interests (z).
For it
would
be of most mischievous
consequence
to the public,
if the strength of the executive power were liable
to be
curtailed
without its own
express consent , by construc-
tions and implications
of the subject .
Yet , where an act
of parliament
is expressly
made for the preservation of
public rights
and the suppression of public
wrongs , and
does
not
interfere
with
the
established
rights
of the
crown , it is said to be binding as well upon the sovereign
as upon the subject (a) : and , likewise , the sovereign may
take the
benefit
of
any
particular
act,
although
not
especially named therein (b) .

,I
shall
speak more
,
when treating
of the military state
.
We are now only
to
consider the
prerogative
of
enlisting
and governing
our military and
naval
forces
;
this
prerogative
,
indeed
,
was disputed
and
contrary
to
all precedent claimed by the long
parliament
of king
Charles
I.;
but
,
upon the restoration
of
his son
,
was solemnly declared by statute
13

the king alone

of
England

ever was the undoubted right
of
his majesty

of
England
;
and that both

of
the houses

:
This statute
of
Charles
II
.
obviously extends not only build forts
;
to
fleets and armies
,
but
also
to
forts and other places
of
strength
,
within the realm
:
the sole prerogative
as

of

as
of
manning

,
which belongs
to
the sovereign

his capacity

appoint
ports and
havens;
they were called upon so often , that , as sir Edward Coke
citing M. Paris assures us (e) , there were in the time of
Henry II.
1115
castles
subsisting
in England .
The
inconveniences
of which,
when
granted
out to private
subjects , the lordly barons of those times , were severely
felt by the whole kingdom
; for , as William of Newburgh
remarks
in the reign of king
Stephen , " erant in Anglia
quodammodo
tot reges vel potius tyranni , quot domini castel-
lorum ."
These inconveniences
were felt by none more
sensibly than by two succeeding princes , king John
and
king Henry III . , and , the greatest part of these
castles
being
demolished
in the barons ' wars , the sovereigns of
after times were very cautious about suffering
them to be
rebuilt in a fortified
manner :
sir Edward
Coke
indeed
lays it down (ƒ) , that
no subject
can build
a castle , or
house of strength , imbattled , or other fortress defensible ,
without the licence of the crown ; by reason of the danger
which would
ensue , if every man
at his pleasure
might
do it.
Measures
for defence of the realm , which necessarily
involve
a large
expenditure of the public money are now
exclusively
undertaken by the legislature (g) .
Partly upon the theory of our
constitution
that the
sovereign is general of the kingdom , and partly upon
a
fiscal
foundation , to secure
his marine
revenue, is based
the royal
prerogative
of appointing
ports and havens , or
such places only at which persons and merchandize may
pass into and out of the realm , as the
sovereign
in his
wisdom
sees
proper .

law all

rivers
and havens were computed among the regalia (1) ,
and were
subject to the sovereign of the state.
And in
England
it has always
been held , that the sovereign is
lord
of the
whole
shore ( ),
and
particularly
is
the
guardian of the ports
and havens, which
are the
inlets
and gates of the realm (k) : and therefore , so early as the
reign of king John , we find
ships
seized
by the
king's
officers
for putting in at places
which were not
legal
ports ( ).
These
legal
ports (m) were undoubtedly
at
first
assigned
by the crown ;
since to
each of them
a
court of port -mote
was
incident (n) , the jurisdiction of
which
must have
flowed
from
the royal
authority : the
great ports of the sea are also referred to , as well known.
and
established , by statute
4 Hen. 4, c.

pro-
hibits
the landing elsewhere under pain of confiscation ;
and the statute
1 Eliz . c.
11 , recites , that the franchise of
lading
and
discharging
had been frequently
granted by
the crown .
wharves
But though the
sovereign had a power of granting the assign
franchise of havens and ports , yet he had not the power of and quays;
resumption , or of narrowing
and
confining
their limits
when
once
established ;
but any person
had
a right to
load
or
discharge
his
merchandize
in any part of
the
haven ; whereby
the revenue of the customs was
much
impaired
and
diminished ,
by fraudulent
landings
in
obscure and private corners .
This occasioned the statutes
1 Eliz . c.

13
&

Car . 2,
c.

s.
14 , which
enabled the crown by commission
to ascertain the limits
of all ports , and to assign
proper wharves and
quays in
each port, for the exclusive landing
and
loading of mer-
chandize .
These statutes indeed were repealed by the 6 Geo . 4 , c.

obtaining
the sovereign's
leave ; provided
he is under
no injunction
of staying
at
home (which liberty was expressly declared in king John's
great charter ( b) , though left out in that of Henry III. ) ;
but, because
every man ought of right to defend the sove-
reign
and his realm , therefore the sovereign at his plea-
sure may , by writ , command
him that he go not beyond
the seas , or out of the realm , without
licence ; and , if he
do the contrary , he shall be punished
for disobeying the
royal mandate .

THE
ROYAL
PREROGATIVES
.
In this ca-
pacity
judges ;
mine
complaints
;
and in
England
this
authority
has
immemorially
been
exercised , according
to the theory of
our constitution , by the sovereign or his substitutes .
He
has the right of erecting courts of judicature
: for , though
the constitution
of the kingdom has intrusted
him with
the whole executive power of the laws , it is impossible , as
it would be improper , that he should personally
carry into
execution this
great
and
extensive
trust : it
is
conse-
quently necessary
, that courts should
be
erected , to assist
him in executing this power : and equally necessary
, that ,
if erected , they should be erected
by his authority (k) ,
or
by the supreme authority of parliament .
Hence it is , that
the jurisdiction of courts
is either
mediately
or
imme-
diately
derived
from
the
crown ,
their
proceedings
run
generally in the
sovereign's
name,
pass
under
his
seal ,
and are executed by his officers .
It is possible , that in very early times , before our
con-
point
the
stitution arrived at its full perfection , our kings in person
sometimes
heard
and
determined
causes
between party
and party (1).
But at present , by the long and uniform
usage of ages , our
sovereigns have delegated their whole
judicial power to the judges of their several courts ; who
are the grand depositaries of the fundamental
laws of the
kingdom , and have gained a known
and stated jurisdic-
tion , regulated by certain and established rules , which the
crown itself cannot now alter but by act of parliament ( m ) .
Moreover ,
in
order
to
maintain
both the dignity
and
independence of the judges
in the
superior
courts , it is
enacted by the statute 13 Will . 3 , c. 2 , that their commis-
sions shall be made (not , as formerly , durante beneplacito ,
but) quamdiu
bene
se
gesserint , and their
salaries
ascer-
tained
and
established ; but
that it
may
be lawful
to
remove them on the address of both houses of parliament .
And by the statute
1 Geo . 3 , c. 23, the judges
are conti-
nued in their offices
during
their good
behaviour ,

In criminal proceedings , or prosecutions for offences , it is

be
a
still higher
absurdity
,
if
the sovereign per- matters

offences are either
against
the king's
peace
,
or
against
his crown and dignity
:
and are
so
laid
in
an indictment
.
For though
in
their
consequences
they
generally
seem
(
except
in
the case
of
treason
,
and
a
few other
cases
)
to
be rather offences
against
the kingdom
than the king
;
yet
,
as
the
public
,
which
is
an
invisible
body
,
has
delegated all
its
power
and
rights
,
with regard
to
the
execution
of
the
laws
,
to
one
visible
magistrate
,
all
affronts
to
that power
,
and breaches
of
those rights
,
are
immediately
offences
against him
,
to
whom
they are
so
delegated by the public
.
The sovereign therefore
is
the
proper person
to
prosecute for public offences
and breaches
of
the peace
,
being the person injured
in
the
eye
of
the
law
.
And this notion was carried so far in the old Gothic
constitution
(
wherein the king was bound by his corona-
tion oath
to
conserve
the
peace
),
that
in
case
of
any
forcible
injury offered
to
the person
of
a
fellow
-
subject
,
the offender was accused
of
a
kind
of
perjury

Closely
connected with the above

is
that
of

;
it
is
reasonable that
he only who
is
injured should have the power
of

and
to

to

THE
ROYAL PREROGATIVES
.
in law is al-
ways pre-
sent in
court;
of dispensing
grace
and
mercy .
Of prosecutions
and
pardons I
shall treat more at large hereafter ; and only
mention them here, in this cursory manner , to show the
constitutional
grounds of this power of the crown , and how
regularly
connected
all the links are in this vast chain of
prerogative .
In the distinct
and separate
existence of judicial func-
tions in a peculiar
body of men , nominated
indeed , but
not removeable
at pleasure , by the
crown , consists
one
main
preservative
of the public liberty ;
which
cannot
subsist
long in
any state , unless
the
administration
of
common justice
be in some degree
separated as well from
the legislative
as from the executive power .
Were such
functions joined with the legislative , the life , liberty , and
property of the subject would be in the hands of arbitrary
judges , whose decisions might be regulated
only by their
own opinions , not by any fundamental
principles
of law ;
which , though legislators
may depart from , yet judges are
bound to observe .
Were it joined with the executive , this
union
might
soon
be
an overbalance
for the
legisla-
tive.
For which
reason , by the statute
16 Car. 1. c. 10 ,
which abolished the court of star -chamber , effectual care
is taken to remove all judicial power out of the hands of
the king's privy council ; who , as
then was evident
from
recent instances , might soon be inclined to pronounce that
for law, which was most
agreeable
to the
prince
or his
officers.
Nothing is more to be avoided , in a free consti-
tution , than uniting the province of a judge with that of a
minister of state .
A consequence
of the prerogative
latterly
adverted to
is the legal ubiquity
of the sovereign , who , in the
eye of
the law, is always
present in all his
courts , though
he
cannot personally distribute
justice (p).
His judges
are
the mirror by which his own image is reflected.
It is the
regal office , not the royal person , that is always
present

THE
SOVEREIGN

323
in court ,
always
ready
to undertake
prosecutions , or to
pronounce judgment
, for the benefit and protection of the
subject .
And from this ubiquity it technically
follows ,
that the
sovereign
cannot be nonsuit
(q) ; for a nonsuit
is the
desertion
of
the
suit or
action by the non -ap-
pearance of the
plaintiff in
court (r) .
For the
same
reason
also , in the forms of legal proceedings , the sove-
reign is not said to appear by his
attorney , as other men
do ; for in contemplation of law he is always present in
court (8).
issue procla-
enforcing
From the same origin-the sovereign being the fountain
and can
of justice-we may also deduce
the prerogative of issuing
mations
for
proclamations
,
which
is
vested
in
him
alone
.
These laws
.
proclamations
have then
a
binding force
,
when
(
as
sir
Edward Coke observes
(t)
)
they are grounded
upon
and
enforce the laws
of
the realm
.
For though
the making
of
laws
is
entirely the work
of
a
distinct part
,
the legisla-
tive
branch
,
of
the
sovereign
power
,
yet the
manner
,
time
,
and circumstances
of
putting those laws
in
exe-
cution
must
frequently
be left
to
the
discretion
of
the
executive
magistrate
.
And therefore
his
constitutions
or
edicts concerning
these points
,
which
we
call
pro-
clamations
,
are binding upon
the subject
,
where they
do
not
either
contradict
the old laws
or tend to
establish
new ones
but only enforce the execution
of
such laws
as
are already
in
being
,
in
such
manner
as
the
sovereign
shall judge necessary
.
Thus the established law
is
,
that
the king may prohibit any
of
his
subjects
from
leaving
the realm
:
a
proclamation
,
therefore
,
forbidding
this
in
general
for three weeks
,
by laying
an embargo upon all
shipping
in
time
of
war
(
u),
will
be
equally binding
as
an
act
of
parliament

all vessels laden with wheat (though
in a time of public
scarcity ) being contrary to law, and particularly
to statute
22 Car . 2 , c.
13 , the advisers of such a proclamation , and
all persons
acting
under it,
found it
necessary to be
indemnified
by a special act of parliament ,
7 Geo . 3 , c. 7.
It was indeed enacted by the
statute
31
Hen .
8 ,
c.
8 ,
that the king's proclamations
should
have the
force of
acts
of parliament
(x) ;
a
statute ,
which
was
calcu-
lated to introduce the most despotic tyranny
; and which
might have
proved fatal to
the
liberties of this king-
dom ,
had it
not
been luckily
repealed (y) , in the mi-
nority of his
successor
, about five years after it had
been
passed .
IV. The sovereign
is likewise
the fountain of honour ,
of office, and of privilege : and this
in a different
sense
from that wherein
he is styled
the fountain
of justice .
A due subordination
of rank is essential for the mainte-
nance of government ; the
people must know and distin-
guish such
as are set over them , in order to yield them
a due respect and obedience ; the
officials themselves , if
encouraged by emulation
and the hopes of preferment will
the better discharge their functions , and the law supposes
that no one can be so good a judge of their several merits
and services , as the sovereign who employs them .
It has
therefore entrusted him with the sole power of conferring
dignities
and honours , in confidence that
he will bestow
them upon none but
such as
deserve
them .
And there-
fore all
degrees
of nobility, of
knighthood , and
other
titles , are received by immediate grant from the crown :
either expressed in writing , by writ
or letters patent , or
by corporeal investiture .
From the same principle
also arises the prerogative of
(x) But with a proviso , that such
proclamations
should not be preju-
dicial to any
person's
inheritance ,
offices,

goods,

laws .

mention
them
incidentally
, in
order to remark
the royal
prerogative of making
them ; which is grounded upon this
foundation , that
the sovereign
having
the
sole adminis-
tration of the government in his hands , is the supreme and
only judge , in what capacities , with what
privileges , and
under what
distinctions , his people are best qualified
to

him.

was

the
nature of foreign
trade , its privileges ,
regulations
and

; and would
also be quite beside the purpose
of these Commentaries , which
are confined to the laws of
England
whereas
no municipal
laws can be sufficient to
order and determine the very extensive
and complicated
affairs of traffic
and merchandize
; neither can they have
a proper
authority
for this
purpose .

exclusively
regarded by another , although
a certain
de-
ference will be paid to them in virtue of the comity of
nations .
And hence the
affairs of commerce are in part
regulated by a law of their
own , called the law
merchant
or lex
mercatoria , the
leading
principles
of which
all
nations
agree in and take notice of.
And in particular
it is held to be
part of the law of England , which
in
deciding the
causes of merchants will take notice of the
rules which
obtain
in
other
commercial
countries ; and
that often
even in
matters
relating
to domestic trade ,
as for instance
with regard
to the
usance of a bill
of
exchange.
With us in England , the royal prerogative , so far
as it
relates to
mere
domestic
commerce, will fall principally
under the following heads :-

THE
ROYAL
PREROGATIVES
.
prerogative of fixing this standard our ancient law vested
in the crown , as in Normandy it belonged to the
duke ( ¿).
This standard was originally kept at Winchester
: and we
find in the laws of king Edgar (j) , near a century before
the Conquest , an
injunction
that
the one measure , which
was kept
at Winchester
, should
be observed throughout
the realm .
Most nations
have regulated
the standard of
measures
of length
by comparison with the parts of the
human body ; as the palm , the hand , the span , the foot ,
the cubit ,
the
ell,
(ulna ,
or
arm ) ,
the
pace , and
the
fathom .
But as these
are of different dimensions in men
of different proportions , our ancient historians (k) inform
us, that
a new
standard
of longitudinal measure was
ascertained
by king Henry I. , who
commanded
that
the
ulna or
ancient
ell , which
answers to the
modern
yard ,
should
be made
of the exact length
of his
own
arm .
And , one
standard of measures of length being
gained ,
all others were thence easily derivable
;
those
of greater
length
by multiplying , those of less by subdividing , that
original standard .
Thus , by the
statute called compositio
ulnarum et perticarum (1), five yards
and
a half make a
perch ; and the
yard
is
subdivided
into
three
feet , and
each foot into twelve inches : an inch being of the length
of three grains of barley .
Superficial
measures
were
derived by squaring
those of length
;
and
measures of
capacity by cubing
them .
The
standard of weights
was
originally taken from
corns of wheat , whence the lowest
denomination of weights was called
a grain
; twenty - two
of which
are directed , by the statute
called
compositio
mensurarum ( m) ,
to
compose
a pennyweight , of penny-
weights , twenty make
an
ounce , twelve ounces
a pound ,
and
so
upwards .
And

principles

standards
were
made ; which ,
being
originally
so fixed
by the crown , were subsequently regulated by the sovereign
in parliament
.
Thus , under king Richard I. , in his par-
liament held at Westminster
, A.D.
1197 , it was ordained
that there
should
be only one weight
and
one
measure
throughout
the
kingdom , and that the custody
of the
assize
or
standard of weights
and
measures
should
be
committed to certain persons in every city and borough ( ~) ;
and hence the ancient office of the king's aulnager
seems
to have been derived , whose duty it was, for a certain fee ,
to measure all cloth made for sale , till the aulnage duties
were
abolished by the statute 11 & 12 Will . 3 , c. 20.
In
king
John's
time
this
ordinance
of king
Richard
was
frequently
dispensed
with
for
money (0) ,
which
occa-
sioned
a
provision
to be made for enforcing
it, in the
great charters
of king John
and his son (p).
These
original
standards were called pondus
regis (q) , and men-
sura
domini
regis (r) ;
and
were
directed
by
various
subsequent statutes to be kept in the exchequer , and all
weights and measures
to be made conformable thereto (s).
But ,
as sir Edward
Coke
observes (t), though
this
had
often
by authority
of
parliament
been
enacted , yet it
could never be
effected
; so forcible
is custom
with
the
multitude .
The regulation
of weights
and measures
has , indeed ,
from
Magna
Carta
downwards , frequently
occupied
the
attention
of parliament ,
and
cannot
now
be
referred
simply to the prerogative .

Accordingly
the construction of contracts of sale is to

agreement

such

it

merce , to 'give it authority , or make it current .
Money
is a common
standard , by comparison with which the
value
of all
merchandise
may
be ascertained :
it is a
sign , which represents
the respective values
or prices of
commodities .
Metals
are well calculated
for this
sign ,
because they are durable , and
are capable of subdivision
;
and
gold , silver , and copper are especially calculated
for
this
purpose ,
because
they
are very portable
and
com-
paratively
scarce .
A metal moreover is primâ facie most
proper for a common
measure , because
it can easily be
reduced
to the same unit of value in all nations : and
every particular
nation fixes on it its own
impression , so
that the weight and purity (wherein consists the intrinsic
value) of coin may be known by mere inspection .
As the quantity
of precious
metals
increases
, that
is ,
the
more of them there is extracted from the mine , this
universal
medium
or common sign would obviously sink
in value , and
grow
less
precious if
its
tendency
to
do
so
were
not by other circumstances
more
or
less materially
counteracted
.
Above
a
thousand
millions
of bullion

have been

less than three centuries after the discovery
of
this
latter
continent
and

,

.
the sovereign power (~).
And with respect to coinage in
general , there
are
three things to be considered therein ;
the materials , the impression , and the denomination .
:
With regard to its materials , sir Edward
Coke lays it
down (a), that the money of England
must
either
be of
gold or silver (b)
and none other was ever issued by the
royal authority till 1672 , when copper farthings
and half-
pence were coined by king
Charles II. , and ordered by
proclamation
to be current
in all payments , under the
value of sixpence , and not otherwise .
But this copper coin
is not quite upon the same footing with the other , par-
ticularly
as
regards the
offence
of counterfeiting
it ( c) .
And in regard
to the silver coin , it is enacted by statute
56 Geo . 3, c . 68 , s . 12 , that
no
tender of silver
money ,
exceeding forty shillings at one time , shall be a sufficient
tender in law .
As to the impressing
or stamping
of coin-this is the
unquestionable
prerogative
of the
crown :
for though
divers bishops and monasteries had formerly the privilege
of coining money , yet , as sir Matthew Hale observes
(d) ,
this was usually
done by special grant from the crown or
by prescription
which
supposes
one :
and therefore
was
derived from , and not in derogation of, the royal preroga-
tive (e) .
And , besides, such grantees had only the profit
of the coinage , and
not the power of instituting
either
(2) In the stat . 24 &
25 Vict . c.
99, the royal
prerogative
of regu-
lating the
coinage
is
thus
recog-
nised ;
sect . 1 sets forth that the
expression " the
queen's
current
gold
or silver
coin ," shall
include
any gold or silver coined in
any of
her , majesty's
mints , or
lawfully
current by virtue
of any proclama-
tion or otherwise .

(b)
The
comparative
values of
gold
and
silver
have
during
the
last few centuries
(preceding
1855)
not
varied
in
any
very
material
degree, because the
proportion
be-
tween
the demand
and supply of
the two
metals has not
materially
varied .

the
impression
or
denomination
;
having
usually
had
the
stamp
for
impressing
coin
sent
them from
the
exchequer .
The denomination
, or value for which the coin is to pass
current , is likewise in the breast of the sovereign ; and , if
any unusual
pieces
are coined, their value must be ascer-
tained by proclamation
or by act of parliament (ƒ) .
In
order to fix the value , the weight
and the fineness of the
metal are to be taken into consideration together .
When
a given weight of gold or silver is of a given fineness , it is
then of the true
standard (g), and called " esterling " or
" sterling"
metal ;
a name for which
various
reasons
have been
given ( ).
And of this
sterling
or esterling
metal all the coin of the kingdom
must be made, by the
statute
25 Edw . 3 , c. 13.
So that the royal
prerogative
seems
not to extend
to the debasing
or enhancing the
value of the coin
below
or
above the sterling value (¿) :
though
sir
Matthew
Hale (j) appears to be of another
opinion .
The
sovereign
may also , by proclamation
legi-
timate
foreign
coin ,
and
make
it
current
here (k) ;
declaring at what value it shall
be taken in payments ( 7) .

THE
SOVEREIGN
IS THE
HEAD
OF THE
CHURCH .
335
In virtue of this authority the sovereign convenes
, pro-
rogues , restrains , regulates , and dissolves all ecclesiastical
synods or convocations .
This was an inherent prerogative
of the crown , long before the time of HenryVIII . , as appears
cur the statute 8 Hen. 6 , c.
1 , and the many authors , both
anywyers and historians , vouched by
sir
Edward
Coke

restrains
the
ord'nvocation from making

in
execution
any

to
the royal prerogative
,
or
to
the laws
,
ag stoms
,
and statutes
of
the realm
,
was declaratory
of
the
the
common law
(p
):
that part
of
it
only being
new
,
which makes the
assent
of
the sovereign actually neces-
sary
to
the validity
of
every
canon
.
The
convocation
or
ecclesiastical synod
in
England
,
differs considerably
in
its
constitution
from the synods
of
other christian kingdoms
:
those
consisting wholly
of
bishops
;
whereas with us the
convocation
,
whether for the province
of
Canterbury
or
for
that
of
York
(q),
is
in
some sort the miniature
of
a
par-
liament
,
over which the archbishop
presides
in
the upper
house
of
bishops representing the house
of
lords
;
and the
lower
house
,
composed
of
representatives
of
the
several
dioceses
at
large
,
and
of
each
particular
chapter
therein
,
resembling
the house
of
commons with its knights
of
the
shire and burgesses
.
This constitution
is
said
to
be
owing
to
the policy
of
Edward
I.:
who thereby
at
one and the
same time let
in
the inferior
clergy
to
the privileges of
framing ecclesiastical canons
(
which before they had not

From this prerogative of being the head of the church ,
arises the sovereign's right of nomination
to vacant bishop-
rics , and
certain other ecclesiastical preferments
;
which
will more properly be considered hereafter ( s) .

CHAPTER VIII .
THE ROYAL REVENUE .
HAVING , in the preceding
Chapter , considered at large
those branches of the prerogative , which contribute
to the
royal dignity, and constitute
the
executive power of the
government , we proceed now to examine the fiscal
pre-
rogatives
of the
sovereign ,
or such
as regard the royal
revenue ;
which
the
British
constitution
has vested in
the crown , in order to support
its
dignity
and maintain
its power : being a portion which
each subject contributes
of
his
property ,
in
order
to
render
more
secure
the
remainder .
The hereditary
revenue of the
crown
was
anciently
derivable
from
various
sources , which
will
be specified
in the ensuing
pages .
To prevent
misconception , how-
ever,
upon
this
subject , two
preliminary
remarks
are
needed.
In the first place, much of the ancient hereditary
revenue of the crown long since passed
to , and is at this
day vested in , the
hands
of subjects , to whom it was
granted
out from time to time by the kings of England,
which rendered the crown in some measure dependent on
the people for its ordinary support and subsistence .
So
that we shall
be obliged
to recount , as part of the royal
revenue , what lords of manors and others frequently look
upon as their own absolute inherent rights ; because
they
are and have been vested in them and their ancestors
for
ages , though in reality originally derived from the grants
of our ancient princes .
Secondly , since the revolution of
1688 , the royal
revenue
has in this country
been
from

separate
pecuniary items which in the aggregate formerly
constituted
this revenue, except only the income derivable
from the private
estates of the sovereign (a) ,
and the
proceeds of property
vested
in
or
appurtenant
to the
crown , being
now
paid
over directly
or indirectly
to the
nation , and made applicable to public purposes (b) .
And ,
in consideration
of the
hereditary
rights
and
revenues
thus
relinquished
by the
sovereign ,
a yearly
sum
is
directed
to be paid
out of the consolidated
fund , which
is available for the support of the royal
household , and
for upholding
the honour and dignity of the crown (c).
Subject
to the
preceding
remarks
the royal
revenue
may
be
described
as
either
ordinary
or extraordinary .
The sovereign's
ordinary revenue having
either subsisted
time
out of mind in the
crown ;
or
else
having
been
granted by parliament , by way of purchase or exchange
for such of its inherent hereditary revenues as were found
inconvenient
to the subject ; this ordinary revenue we will
in the first place consider .
I.
The first of the sovereign's ordinary revenues to be
temporali-
noticed is of an ecclesiastical
kind (as are also the three
succeeding ones ) ; viz . the custody of the temporalities of
bishops
by which
are meant all the lay revenues , lands ,
and tenements (in which
is included
his barony) which
belong
to
an archbishop's
or bishop's
see .
And
these
upon the vacancy of the see are immediately
vested in the
sovereign
as a consequence
of his prerogative in church.
matters ; for the sovereign being considered as the founder
of all archbishoprics and bishoprics , to him during vacancy
(a) 25 & 26 Vict. c. 37.
(b) The receipt , custody , and issue
of the public monies is now mainly
regulated by the stat . 29 & 30 Vict .
c. 39.
(c) Post.

OF BISHOPS '
TEMPORALITIES
.

they revert .
And for the same reason , before the disso-
lution of abbeys , the sovereign
had the
custody of the
temporalities
of all such
abbeys
and priories
as
were of
royal
foundation
(but not of those founded by subjects)
on the death of the abbot or prior (d).
Another reason
may also
be given , why
the
policy
of the law
vested
this
custody
in
the
crown ;
because
the
lands
and
possessions of a
see , as the
successor
is
not
known ,
would be liable to spoil
and devastation , if no one
had a
property
therein .
Therefore
the law has given
to the
crown , not the
temporalities
themselves , but the custody
of the temporalities , till such time
as a successor
is ap-
pointed , with power of taking to itself all the intermediate
profits , without any account of the
successor
; and with
the right of presenting
to such
benefices
and other pre-
ferments
as fall within the time of vacancy (e) .
This
revenue
is of so
high a nature ,
that
it could
not
be
granted
out to a subject , before, or even after it accrued :
but now by the
statute 15 Edw . 3, st. 4 , c. 4 & c. 5 , the
crown
may , after
the vacancy , lease the temporalities
to
the
dean and chapter ;
saving
to itself
all advowsons ,
escheats, and the like.
Our ancient
kings , and parti-
cularly William
Rufus , were
not
only
remarkable
for
keeping
the bishoprics
a long
time vacant , for the sake
of enjoying the temporalities , but also committed horrible
waste on the woods and other parts of the estate ; and ,
to crown all,
would
never , when
a see
was
filled
up ,
restore
to the bishop
his
temporalities
again , unless he
purchased them at an exorbitant price .
To remedy which ,
king Henry I. (ƒ) granted
a charter at the beginning of
his reign , promising
neither
to
sell , nor let to farm , nor
take any thing from the domains of the church , till the
successor was installed .
And it
was
made one of the
articles of the great charter (g) , that
no waste should
be

committed in the
temporalities of
bishoprics ,
neither
should
the
custody of them
be
sold .
The
same
is or-
dained
by the
statute of Westminster
I. (h) ;
and
the
statute
14
Edw .
3, st. 4 , c. 4 , is still
more
explicit
in
prohibiting the other
exactions .
Formerly also it was
a frequent abuse , that
the crown would , for trifling or no
causes ,
seize the temporalities
of bishops ,
even
during
their lives , into its own hands : but this
was guarded
against by statute
1 Edw . 3 , st. 2 , c. 2 (i) .
This branch of the royal revenue, once very considerable ,
is now by a customary indulgence reduced to nothing
for
at present ,
as
soon as a new
bishop is consecrated and
confirmed , he receives
the restitution
of his temporalities
quite entire , and untouched , from the crown : and at the
same time does
homage to his sovereign : and then , but
not sooner, he has a fee simple in his bishopric , and may
maintain
an action for the profits (k) .
II. The
sovereign
is entitled
to a corody , as the law
calls it, out of every bishopric , that is, to send one of his
chaplains
to be maintained
by the bishop , or to have a
pension
allowed him till the bishop
promotes
him to a
benefice (1) .
This was in the nature of an acknowledg-
ment to the sovereign , as founder of the see , since he had
formerly the same corody or pension from every abbey or
priory
of royal
foundation .
The
prerogative
right
now
mentioned
is fallen into total disuse : though sir Matthew
Hale says (m) , that no prescription will discharge it.

(i) Both before and
after the Re-
formation
the
episcopal
revenues
were
much
impoverished
by the
bishops
themselves .
(See Hallam,
Const . Hist . i. 303-305 .)
The
statutes
restraining
these
aliena-
tions by the bishops
(1 Eliz . c. 19,
s. 5 ; 13 Eliz . c. 10) ; came too late
to prevent
many
valuable
posses-
sions
being
granted
away by
the
bishops
; more
especially
since the
exception
contained
in the first-
mentioned
statute
in

of
alienation

These were originally

the papal usurpations over

,
during the reigns
of
king John and Henry III
.
in
the sce
of

;
and afterwards
attempted
to
be
made uni-
versal by popes
Clement
V.
and John XXII
.
about the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
.
The first fruits
,
primate
or
annates
,
were the first year's whole profits
of
the spiritual
preferment
,
according
to
a
rate
or
valor made
in
this
wise
:
A.D.
1253
,
pope
Innocent IV
.
granted
all
the first fruits and tenths
to
Henry III
.
for three years
,
which occasioned
a
taxation
in
the following year
,
some-
times called the Norwich taxation
,
and sometimes Inno-
cent's valuation
.
In
1288
,
Nicholas IV
.
granted the tenths
to
Edward
I.
for six years
,
and
a
new valuation was com-
menced
in
the
same year by the king's
precept
,
which
valuation
was
,
so
far
as
it
extended over the province
of
Canterbury
,
finished
in
1291
,
and
as
to
York also
in
the
following year
.
By this
assessment the amounts
of
all
taxes
,
as
well those paid
to
the king
as
to
the pope
,
were
regulated until the
26

It
became ne-

chiefly
in
consequence
of
the Scottish
invasion

,
which rendered
the clergy
of
those
districts
unable
to

also claimed by the holy see , under
no better
pretence
than a strange misapplication
of that precept of the Levi-
tical law,
which
directed (r) , that
the
Levites
" should
offer the tenth part of their
tithes
as a heave -offering to
the Lord , and give it to Aaron the high priest ."
This
claim of the pope met however with a vigorous
resistance
from
the
English
parliament
;
and
various
acts
were
passed
to prevent
and restrain it, particularly
the statute
6 Hen.
4 ,
c .
1 , which
calls it a horrible
mischief , and
damnable custom .
But the popish clergy , blindly devoted
to the will of a foreign
master , still kept it on foot ;
sometimes
more
secretly ,
sometimes
more
openly
and
avowedly
so that
in the
reign
of Henry VIII . , it was
computed , that in the
compass of
fifty years
800,000
ducats had been sent to Rome for first fruits only .
And ,
as the clergy expressed this willingness
to contribute
so
much of their income to the
head of the church , it was
thought proper (when in the
same reign the papal
power
was abolished , and the king was declared the head of the
church of England ) to annex
this
revenue to the crown ;
which was done by statute 26 Hen. 8 , c . 3 ,
( confirmed by
statute
1 Eliz . c . 4 , ) and a new valor beneficiorum
was then
made, by which the clergy are at present rated (s).
By these last -mentioned
statutes
all vicarages
under
ten pounds a year , and all rectories under ten marks , are
discharged
from
the payment of first fruits :
and if, in
such livings
as
continue
chargeable with this
payment ,
the incumbent
lives but half a year , he shall pay only one
quarter of his
first -fruits ; if but
one
whole year , then
half of them ; if a year and a half, three quarters ; and if
two years , then the whole ; and not otherwise (t).
Like-

valor

is
commonly
called
the
" King's

wise by the statute 27 Hen .
8 , c. 8 , no tenths
are to be
paid for the first year , for then the first fruits
are
due :
and by other
statutes of queen
Anne, in the
fifth and
sixth years of her reign , if a benefice
be under fifty pounds
per annum clear yearly value , it shall
be discharged
from
the payment of first fruits and tenths .
Thus the richer clergy , having been subjected at first to
a foreign
exaction , were afterwards , when that
yoke was
shaken off, liable
to a like misapplication
of their
reve-
nues , through
the rapacious disposition
of the then reign-
ing
monarch :
till at length the
piety
of queen
Anne
restored to the church what had been thus indirectly.taken
from it.
This she did , not by remitting the tenths and
first fruits entirely : but by applying
these superfluities
of the larger benefices to make up the deficiencies of the
smaller .
And to this end she granted her royal charter ,
which was confirmed by the statute 2 Anne , c. 11 , whereby
the revenue of first fruits and tenths is vested in trustees
for ever, to form a perpetual fund for the augmentation of
poor livings.
This is usually
called queen
Anne's bounty ;
which
has been
further
regulated by statute (u) , and the
general object for which it was instituted
has by nume-

distribution
of
landed property , or such as came
to it afterwards by for-
feitures or other means , were formerly
much
more exten-
sive than at present , having
been in great part granted
away to private persons . This caused parliament frequently
to interpose ;
and
particularly , after king William III .
had greatly impoverished
the crown , an act passed (y) to
place restrictions
upon further
alienation
by the crown
of its possessions .
The revenue under
our notice is now
derivable
in England from the
ancient manors
and de-
mesnes of the crown (z) , from lands which have from time
to time been purchased for the crown , with the produce of
the
sales of other portions of its
property , and from the
fee farm rents reserved in ancient grants by the crown .
The crown also derives a revenue (a) from the minerals
within its properties , or within lands wherein the minerals
have been reserved to it, as also from minerals underneath
the fore shore and bed of the sea .
The royal forests have, with the exceptions below men-
tioned (6), been disafforested , and the crown now possesses

to 148,0007.

the
crown
possesses the soil and
free-
hold
of
the
unenclosed
wastes
subject
to the rights
of common
exercisable
over them .
It also has
forestal
rights not only over
the
wastes, but over
the private
lands
within the boundaries of the forest
where
those rights have not been
granted
away .
Under the 9 & 10
Will, 3,
c. 36, the
crown
acquired
the right to
enclose
6000 acres of
the
wastes
as
a
nursery
for the
growth
of navy
timber , and
from
time
to time
as the trees became

the
browsing
of
deer and cattle
to throw open the
enclosures ,
and
to
enclose
a like
quantity
in lieu thereof .
By the
14 & 15 Vict . c. 76, the
crown re-
linquished
the right to keep deer in
the forest , and as a compensation for
so doing
was
authorised
to enclose
and keep
enclosed
10,000
acres of
the

The branch of revenue now treated of is in Wales de-
rived from the seignorial
possessions which came into the
hands of the crown on the
conquest of the principality.
These possessions consist of lordships and manors contain-
ing tracts of unenclosed wastes , and of wastes
which have
been from time to time enclosed under acts of parliament ,
with a reservation
to the crown of the
mines , minerals ,
and
quarries
therein .
Of such
unenclosed
wastes, the
soil and freehold
subject to the exercise of commonable
rights are vested in the crown .
The items of this portion.
of revenue consist of chief or quit rents , payable by the ten-
ants of the lordships
and manors , of the rents of encroach-
ments made upon the waste , of the rents of shootings and
fisheries ,

charters , which
are renewable
on change of ownership , granted
by the crown .
Such
charters
are
granted , subject
to the
payment of annual
duties
either in money or kind , sometimes only nominal
in amount (c) , but
more frequently of substantial
value .
These are called feu duties , and from them a considerable
revenue is derived .
Composition
duties are also payable
on the renewal of charters .
On the abolition
of episcopacy in Scotland , A.D.
1690 ,
the revenues of the bishoprics fell to the crown , and such
of them as were not sold now form part of its revenue .
They consist of the landed
property and duties belonging
to the bishoprics , and the
tithes , or teinds , which
were
enjoyed by the bishops .
These teinds have in many cases
been valued and are payable in money or kind , according
to the valuations .
In some cases , however , they are still
unvalued ,
and
then
are
estimated
at
one- fifth
of the
stock
and
crop .
The
stipends
of parish
ministers
are ,
however, a first charge upon the teinds , the ministers ,
moreover , being
entitled
to augmentations
of their sti-
pends at stated intervals .
The
amount of the augmen-
tations , and the manner in
which
they
are apportioned

by the

derived by the
crown from its surplus teinds .

The
crown
revenue in Ireland
is
derived principally
from the ancient
rents
reserved in grants
made by the
crown of demesne lands
and
ecclesiastical
property for-
merly belonging
to the monasteries , as also from the quit
rents arising from estates
forfeited to the crown by persons
implicated
in the rebellions of 1641 and 1688.
The es-
tates thus forfeited in 1641 were by the Act of Settlement
and Explanation
, 14 & 15 Car . 2 , c. 2 , and 17 & 18 Car . 2 ,
c . 2 , vested in the
crown , and directed to be disposed of
for the
satisfaction of the claims of the
adventurers and
soldiers who
had
advanced money
during
the
rebellion .
In a few years they were thus nearly all distributed
, with
reservation
to the crown of an acreable
quit rent .
The
estates
forfeited
in
1688 , were also mostly
sold by the
trustees in whom
they
were
vested , and at the present
time the crown possesses
little , if any , landed property in
Ireland (e).
The Isle of Man, as formerly
stated (f), is a manor or
lordship
of itself, the sovereignty of which was granted in
the
15th
century to the Stanley family, but resumed by
the crown in 1765.
The manorial
possessions
included in
the original grant of the
island
were, in the year 1826 ,
likewise
purchased by the crown from the duke of Atholl ,
in whom they had
become
vested , and the land revenues
of the crown , derivable from this portion of its dominions ,
now consist of rents
and services in the
nature of quit
rents , alienation
fines , payable
on descent of property ,
rents
of
unappropriated
lands
and
foreshore ,
and
the
profits of mines and quarries (g).
land
revenues
in
Scotland
were
placed
under
the
commissioners
of woods , &c., post.
(e) The land
revenue
in Ireland
was
locally administered
till the
year
1827,
when
by stat .
7 & 8
Geo . 4, c. 68, it was
placed
under
the management
of the then
com-
missioners

of unenclosed
mountain
land (about 25,000 acres),
known as the
Lord's
Forest , was by
an act of the local legislature
passed
in the year
1860 disafforested , an
allotment
of about 8000 acres being
set out to the crown in satisfaction
of its rights.
This allotment

THE
ROYAL REVENUE
.
The
crown
revenues in the island
of
Alderney
were
granted on lease in the year 1683 for
a term of 99 years ,
and in 1763
a fresh lease of them
for a like
term was
granted .
In the year 1824 , however , the lessee's
interest
was purchased , and the revenues
have since been
admi-
nistered on behalf of the crown .
They consist of harbour
dues ,
tithes , alienation
fines , and the rents of
certain
land and premises belonging to the crown .
The
management
of the lands including the
woods ,
forests (h), parks (i) , and
chases
belonging
to the crown ,
has by various statutes passed
during the present century
been
readjusted (k).
The above-mentioned
sources of
about
5700 acres of land
purchased
by the crown from the disafforesting
commissioners
is now in process of
being disposed of as sheep farms .
(h) Royal forests
have
been de-
fined to be waste grounds belonging
to the
crown
replenished
with
beasts
of chase or venery ; which
are under
the king's protection , for
his
royal recreation
and
delight .
(Manwood , For. L. ch. 1.)
Lord Coke
says that the number
of royal forests in England in his
time
was sixty -nine
(4 Inst . 319,
293).
Such
as
still
exist
are
managed by the commissioners
of
crown
lands , but
are governed
by
peculiar laws .
(i ) The royal
parks
(except that
of Windsor) are under the manage-
ment of the commissioners
of works
and
public buildings,
who
have
also
charge
of
the
other
crown
properties
mentioned in the
14 &
15 Vict . c. 42, s. 22.
(k) The changes above alluded to
may be thus epitomised :-
By stat .
50
Geo. 3,
c.
65, the
office of
surveyor -general
of the
land revenue
was united
with that
of the office of surveyor -general
of
woods , forests ,
parks ,
and
chases.
By the 7 &
8
Geo. 4,
c. 68, the
office of surveyor -general
was abo-
lished , and the
woods , forests , and
land revenues
were
placed
under
the management
of commissioners .
In
1832 the
department
of works
and public buildings was united to
that of the woods , forests , and land
revenues , but
the
results
of this
union not having
been satisfactory
the
two
departments
were by the
14 & 15 Vict . c. 42
again
divided .
The general principle upon
which
the crown
lands were by this latter
statute respectively
allotted
to the
management
of the
commissioners
of woods ,
forests ,
and land
reve-
nues ,
and
the
commissioners
of
works
and
public
buildings
was
this-all the estates and lands
pro-
ducing
or
capable
of
producing
revenue
and
not
dedicated
(as are
the
London
parks ) to the enjoy
ment
of the
public ,
were
placed
under
the
charge
of the commis-
sioners
of woods ,
& c., whilst all
lands
so
dedicated
were
placed
under
the
charge
of the commis-
sioners of works .

previously
been
managed by surveyors-
general , have
at length
been placed under the control of
two commissioners , who
are
appointed
by letters
patent
of the crown , and , subject to statutory provisions (1) , act
under
the directions of the treasury .
Of these commis-
sioners , one has, under the
14
&
15 Vict. c . 42 , s . 5 , the
management of the land revenues in England , excepting
the fee farm
rents , the forests , and
some of the allot-
ments
awarded
to the
crown
on the
disafforestation
of
royal forests , the matters
thus
excepted being under the
management of the other commissioner , together with the
land revenues in Scotland , Ireland , and the Isles of Man
and Alderney .
The commissioners
have power subject to the authority
of the board of treasury to grant
leases of crown property
for terms not exceeding
31 years , and
leases of building
land for terms not exceeding 99 years .
In the latter case
fines , subject to certain conditions , may be taken .
The commissioners
are also empowered to sell
or ex-
change the possessions and land revenues of the crown ,
to purchase lands , tenements , and hereditaments , and to
redeem the land tax on crown
property .
No sale or pur-
chase where the
consideration
exceeds
1007. , and no ex-
change or lease is to be made without
a warrant from the
commissioners
of the
treasury , nor until the report of a
surveyor
has been
obtained
certifying
the value of the
premises .
The
surveyor's
declaration
may , however , be
dispensed with in cases where the value of the property is
inconsiderable .
Grants
to
a limited extent may be made by the sove-
reign as sites for churches , schools , parsonages , &c.

cate of the deed .
The land revenues of the crown in England , Scotland ,
Ireland, and the
Isles of Man and Alderney
are
super-
intended
and collected by receivers who in England and
Wales are required to be surveyors .
In Ireland
the land
revenue
is
collected by the collectors of excise under the
superintendence of a branch
office of the
department of
woods , &c. , called
the quit rent office .
The
forests
and
plantations are locally
superintended by deputy surveyors ,
and the mines in Dean Forest by a deputy gaveller .
The
receivers
are
required
to
give
security
for
the
faithful
discharge
of their duties ,
and they
are bound
to account to the commissioners
of woods , &c. , and to
transmit
all
monies from time
to time received by them
to the commissioners , being
chargeable with
interest

any
sum
retained
by them exceeding

The commissioners
of woods ,
&c. , are
empowered
to
authorise
entries for breaches of covenant , but
subject
to the
approval
of the
commissioners
of the
treasury ,
they may release covenants , and grant waivers of breaches.
They may also compound for arrears of rent, and , subject
to the same authority , they may settle disputed boundaries
and compromise disputed
claims .
The general powers of
leasing
and sale
do
not extend to the
royal
forests , but
the commissioners
may sell
small
parcels of the wastes
of the forests when intermixed
with other lands
or
not
fitted for the growth of timber (m).
The
monies
arising from sales in the royal
forests
are
directed to be applied first of all in the purchase of com-
mon , fuel , and other rights , and of land and hereditaments
(m) They are also
empowered to
grant
licences
to
shoot

The
monies
arising
from all other
sales of the
land
revenues are applied in the purchase of other property , in
payments
for
equality of exchange of land , &c. , in the
redemption of the land tax on crown property , and in the
payment
of the

relating
to
such

and
until
so
applied
the
capital of the land revenues
is invested in the three per
cent . consols-the dividends
being
applied
as part of the
income of the land revenue .
The income of the land
revenue is applied in payment
of the expenses
of management , and of any charges upon
the land revenues-the surplus
being paid into the ex-
chequer and carried to the consolidated fund .
The commissioners of woods are required
to report to
parliament
every year , giving full particulars
of all leases ,
sales , exchanges , and grants
made during the preceding
year , and an account of the income and expenditure
re-
lating to the property under their management .
The accounts of the commissioners
of woods , &c . , are
audited by the
exchequer and audit department , and the
business of the land revenue record office
is conducted by a
keeper , whose duties are specified by stat . 2 Will . 4 , c. 1 (n) .
By the 29 & 30 Vict . c. 62 , entitled " The Crown Lands
Act ,

and it was
directed
that
compensation
should
be made
to the land revenue of the
crown for the
transfer , such
compensation to be settled by arbitration .
By the same act the cost of permanent improvemer
upon the crown possessions was authorised
to be charge
to the
capital of the
land
revenue
and
to be
repaid
out of the income
thereof within
a period
not exceeding
thirty years.
The same act directs that one moiety of the net
ann¬¬
income from crown mines and quarries shall be carried
the capital account of the land revenue , and authorises th
commissioners
of woods to
take
fines
on the grant of
leases of mines and quarries or on the grant of licences to
assign such leases

In as much as the land revenues
of the crown were sur-
rendered by the
reigning
sovereign
to the
public
in
consideration
of the civil list , and on the demise of the
reigning
sovereign will revert to the crown (o) , it is rightly
esteemed
the
duty of the commissioners
of woods , &c.
who represent both the crown and the public
to preserve
those revenues
intact .
The capital of the land revenue is
the reversion of the crown ; the income
belongs for the
time
to the
public .
The
commissioners
of woods are
therefore bound to take care that the one is not
sacrificed
to the other .
On behalf of the public it is their duty to
obtain
as large
an annual
income as possible from the
crown property .
On behalf of the crown it is their duty
to see that no part of the capital
is sacrificed , in order
to
increase the immediate income (p).

(VII.) Pro-
fits of
military
tenures.
By reason
however
of the
difficulties
attendant
on
effectually asserting
a right to the gold and silver found
in mines worked by private
owners
and adventurers , the
revenue thence derived to the crown is inconsiderable
(t).
VII. To the
general
head
under
our
consideration
might formerly
have been referred
the advantages which
arose
to the sovereign from the profits
of his military
tenures , to which most lands in the kingdom
were subject
until
the
statute
12
Car . 2,
c.
24 , in
great
measure
abolished them
:
the
explication
of the nature of these
tenures must be postponed
to the second Book of these
Commentaries .
Hither also might have been referred the
profitable
prerogative
of
purveyance
and
pre-emption
:
which was
a right enjoyed by the crown of buying up
provisions
and
other
necessaries , by the intervention
of
the king's purveyors , for the use of his royal
household ,
at an appraised valuation , in preference to all others , and
even without
consent of the owner : and also of forcibly
impressing
the carriages and horses of the subject , to do
the king's business on the public roads , in the conveyance
of timber , baggage , and the like , however inconvenient
to
the proprietor ,
upon
paying
him a settled
price (u).
A
prerogative
which
prevailed
pretty
generally
throughout
Europe , during
the scarcity of gold
and silver , and the
high valuation of money consequent thereupon .
In early
times the king's
household
was
supported
by
specific
renders of corn, and other victuals , from the tenants of
the respective
demesnes
; and there was also a continual
market
kept at the palace gate to furnish viands for the
royal
use (x) .
And this answered all purposes , in those
ages of simplicity, so long as the king's court

But when it removed from one part
of the kingdom
to another (as frequently happened ) , it
was found
necessary to send purveyors beforehand
to get
together
a
sufficient
quantity
of provisions
and
other
necessaries
for
the
king's
household
;
and ,
lest
such
unusual
demand
should
raise
them
to
an exorbitant
price , the powers before mentioned were vested
in these
purveyors ; who , in process
of time , very greatly abused
their
authority ,
and
became
oppressive
to the subject ,
though of little
advantage to the
crown ;
ready money
in open market (when the royal
residence was more per-
manent ,
and
specie
began to be plentiful) being found
upon experience to be the best proveditor of any .
Where-
fore by degrees
the
powers of purveyance declined , and
having
fallen
into
disuse
during
the
suspension
of
monarchy , king
Charles II. at his restoration
consented ,
by the statute
above
cited ,
to
resign
entirely
these
branches
of his revenue and power (y) : and the parlia-
ment , in part of recompense ,
settled
on him
and
his
successors
the excise
on beer and other liquors , the nature
of which will be explained
in a subsequent
part of this
chapter .
VIII. The profits arising from courts of justice may be
specified as constituting
an eighth branch of the ordinary
revenue of the
crown , and consist in fines imposed upon
offenders , forfeitures
of recognizances ,
and
certain
fees
due to the crown in respect of various
legal matters .
Of
these , in process
of time , some were granted out to private
persons , or appropriated
to particular
uses , and the residue
are now
available
for public purposes.
Moreover , by the
stat. 3 & 4 Will . 4 ,

(a) Any

being
the immediate
cause of the death of
a reasonable
creature , was called a
deodand ,
and was
forfeited
to the
crown , to be applied
to pious
uses,
and distributed
in alms by the high
almoner
(1 Hale, P.
C. 419 ; Fleta,
1. 1, c. 25) ; though it seems to have
been originally designed , in Catho-
lic times , as an expiation
,for the
souls of such as were snatched away
by
sudden
death ;
and
for that
purpose
ought
properly
to
have
been given

(Fitzh .

same
manner as the apparel of astranger ,
found
dead,
was
applied
to
pur-
chase masses
for
the good
of his
soul . If a horse , an
ox , or
other
animal , of his own
motion , killed
as well an infant as an adult , or if
a cart
ran
over him, it would
in
either case have been forfeited
as a
deodand , in
accordance with
the
maxim , Omnia quæ movent ad mor-
tem sunt Deo danda
(Bracton , 1. 3,
c. 5), which was grounded upon this
additional
reason , that such a mis-
fortune is in part ascribable
to the
negligence of the
owner , and there-
fore
he
was
deemed to have been
properly
punished
by
such
for-
feiture .
A like punishment
was in
like
cases inflicted
by
the
Mosaic
law : "if an ox gore a man that he
die , the ox shall be stoned ,
and
his flesh shall not be eaten " (Exod .
xxi. 28).
Where
a thing not in motion
was
the
cause of a man's
death , that
part only which was the immediate
cause
of death
was
forfeited
;
as
if a man climbing up the wheel of
a cart , was killed by falling from
it, the wheel alone was a deodand ,
but, wherever
the thing
was in
motion , not only that part which
immediately
gave
the
wound
(as
the wheel , which ran over his body ),
but
all things which moved
with
it, and helped to make the wound
more
dangerous
(as the
cart
and
loading , which increased
the pres-
sure of the
wheel ), were forfeited .
It mattered
not whether
the owner
was concerned in the killing or not :
for, if a man killed
another
with
my sword , the sword
was forfeited
as an
accursed
thing .

sure-trove.
X. The
next
item of revenue
to be
noticed is that (X. ) Trea-
derivable
from
treasure -trove (deduced
from
the French
word trouver, to find ) , called in Latin
thesaurus
inventus ,
which is where
any money , coin , gold , silver , plate , or
bullion is found hidden in the earth , or other private place ,
the
owner thereof
being
unknown
; in which
case the
treasure belongs to the crown or rather to the public ( c) ;
but if he that hid it
be known ,
or
afterwards
found
out , the owner , not the crown , is entitled to it (d).
Also
if it be found in the sea , or upon the earth , it belongs not
to the queen , but
to the finder , if no owner appears (e) .
So
that it seems
it is the hiding , not the abandoning of
the chattel , that gives the crown a property in it : Brac-
ton (f),
defining
treasure -trove in the
words
of
the
civilians , to be " vetus depositio
pecuniae ."
This difference
clearly arises from the
different
intentions
which the law
implies in the owner .
A man , who hides his treasure in
a secret place, evidently
does
not mean to relinquish
his
property in it ; but reserves
a right of claiming it again ,
when
he
sees
occasion ; and if he
dies , and the
secret.
also
dies with him , the law gives
such
treasure
to the
sovereign
as part of the royal
revenue
.
But a man who
casts his
treasure
into
the
sea ,
or scatters it upon the
public surface of the earth , is construed to have absolutely
abandoned his property , and returned it into the common
stock , without any intention of reclaiming
it : and there-
fore
it
belongs ,
as in
a
state of nature , to
the
first
occupant
or finder ; unless
the owner appear and assert

licitor to the treasury .

his
right,
thus
proving
that the
loss was by accident
merely .
Formerly all treasure -trove belonged to the finder (g) ;
as was also the rule of the civil law ( ).
Afterwards
it
was judged
expedient for the purposes of the state, and
particularly
for the coinage , to allow part of what was so
found to the crown : which
part was assigned to be all
hidden treasure ; such
as is casually lost and unclaimed ,
and also such as is designedly abandoned , still remaining
the right of the fortunate finder .
And
that the
prince
shall be entitled
to this hidden treasure is now grown to
be , according to Grotius (i), "jus commune
et quasi gen-
tium."
The finding of deposited treasure was much more
frequent ,
and
the treasures themselves
were more con-
siderable , in the infancy of our constitution , than at present .
When the Romans , and other inhabitants of the countries
which composed
their
empire , were driven
out by the
northern tribes , they concealed their money under ground ;
with a view of resorting
to it again when the heat of the
irruption should be over, and the invaders driven back to
their deserts .
But, as this never happened , the treasures
were never claimed ; and on the
death of the
owner of
treasure
thus
concealed the
secret
also died with him.
The
conquering
generals ,
being
aware of the value of
these hidden mines , made it highly penal to secrete
them
from the public
service .
In England therefore , as among
the feudists (k), the punishment
of such as kept
secret
the finding
of hidden
treasure was formerly
no less
than
death ; but now it is only fine and imprisonment
(1).

These
are
given to the crown by
the law, as
a punishment
upon the owner , for not him-
self pursuing
the felon , and taking
away the goods from
him (m).
And
therefore if the
party
robbed
do
his
diligence
immediately
to follow
and apprehend
the thief
(which is
called
making
fresh
suit ) ,
or
convict
him
afterwards , or procure evidence to convict him, he shall

Waived
goods moreover do not
belong
to the sovereign , till
seized
by somebody for his
use ; for if the party robbed can seize them first, though
at the
distance
of twenty years, the
crown
shall
never
have them (o) .
If the goods are hid by the thief,
or left
any where by him, so that he had not them
about him ,
when
he fled, and therefore did
not throw them away in
his flight, these are not bona wariata , but the owner may
have them again when he
pleases (p) .
The
goods of a
foreign
merchant ,
though
stolen
and
thrown
away in
flight , shall
never be waifs (q) ; the reason whereof may
be, not
only
for
the
encouragement of trade , but also
because
there is no wilful default in the foreign merchant's
not pursuing

or his grantees , the
animals
thus
found
straying
must
be
proclaimed
in
the
church
and
two
market
towns next
adjoining to the place where they are
found ; and then , if no man claims them , after proclama-
tion and
a year
and
a day passed, they belong to the
crown
or its
substitute
without
redemption (s) ;
even
though
the owner were a minor , or were under any legal
incapacity (t) .
If the
owner
claims
an
estray within
the year and day, he must
pay the charges of finding ,
keeping , and proclaiming it (u) .
The king or lord has no
property in it till the year and day passed
: for if a lord
keepeth an estray three quarters of a year , and within the
year it strayeth
again ,
and another
lord
getteth it , the
other lord cannot
take it again (x).
Any beasts may be
estrays , that are by nature
tame or reclaimable , and in
which
there is a valuable
property as sheep , oxen , swine ,
and
horses, which we
in
general
call
cattle ;
and
so
Fleta (y) defines them , pecus vagans, quod nullus petit,
sequitur vel advocat .
For animals upon which the law sets
no value , as a dog or
cat , and animals feræ naturæ ,
as
a
bear or wolf, cannot be considered
as
estrays .
So swans
may be estrays, but not any other fowl (~) ; whence swans
are said to be royal fowl .
The reason of which distinction
seems
to be, that cattle and swans being of a reclaimed
nature , the
owner's
property in them is not lost merely
by their
temporary
escape ;
and they
also , from
their
intrinsic value , are a sufficient
pledge for the expense
of
the lord of the franchise
in keeping
them the year and
day .
For he who takes an estray is bound , so long as he
keeps it, to find it in provisions , and preserve it from
damage (a) ; and may not use it by way of labour , but is
liable
to an action for so doing (6) .

XIII . A thirteenth branch of the ordinary revenue of the (XIII ) Roy-
sovereign , said to be grounded
on the consideration of his
guarding
and protecting the seas from pirates and robbers ,
is the right to royal
fish , which
are whale
and sturgeon :
and these , when
either thrown
ashore , or caught near the
coast , belong to the crown in virtue of their superior excel-
lence (d).
Indeed , our ancestors seem to have entertained
a very high notion
of the
importance
of this right ; it
being
a prerogative
of the kings of Denmark
and the
dukes
of Normandy
(e) ;
and from one
of these it was
probably derived to our princes .
It is expressly claimed
and allowed in the statute de prærogativâ
regis (ƒ) ; and
the most ancient treatises of law make mention of it (g) .
Wreck.
XIV . Another
maritime
revenue , founded partly upon (XIV.)
the
same reason,
is derivable
from
wrecks , which
are
declared to belong to the
crown by the same prerogative
statute 17 Edw . 2 , c.
11 , and were so , long before , at the
common law.
It is worthy
of observation , how greatly
the law concerning
wrecks
has
been
altered ,
and the
rigour of it gradually
softened in favour of the distressed
proprietors .
Wreck , by the
ancient
common law, was
where any
ship was lost
at
sea , and the goods or cargo
were thrown upon the land ; in which
case these goods , so
wrecked , were
adjudged
to
belong to the crown : for it
was held that , by the
loss of the ship , all property was
gone out of the original owner ( ).
But this
was un-
doubtedly
adding
sorrow to sorrow , and
was consonant
neither to reason
nor to humanity .

THE
ROYAL
REVENUE .
first ordained by king Henry I. that if any person escaped
alive out of the ship it should be no wreck ( ) ; and after-
wards king
Henry II. , by his
charter (k) , declared , that
if on the coasts of either England ,
Poictou ,
Oleron ,
or
Gascony , any ship
should
be distressed, and
either man
or beast should escape or be found therein alive , the goods
should
remain to the
owners , if claimed by them within.
three months ;
but otherwise should be
esteemed
wreck ,
and should belong to the king , or other lord of the fran-
chise.
This was again
confirmed with improvements by
king Richard I. , who , in the second
year of his reign (1) ,
not only established
these
concessions
, by ordaining
that
the
owner , if he was shipwrecked
and
escaped , " omnes
res suas liberas
et quietas haberet ," but
also , that , if he
perished , his children , or in
default of them his brethren
and sisters , should retain the property ; and , in default of
brother
or sister , then the
goods
should
remain
to the
king (m ).
And the law, as laid down by Bracton in the
reign
of Henry III. , seems
still to have improved in
its
equity
.
For then
,
if
a
dog
(
for
instance
)
escaped
,
by
which the owner might
be discovered
,
or
if
any mark were
set on the goods
,
by which they might
be
known
again
,
it
was
held
to
be no wreck
(n).
And this
is
certainly
most agrecable
to
reason
;
the rational
claim of the crown
.
being
only founded upon this
,
that the true owner cannot
be
ascertained
.

the time

that if a man , a dog , or a cat, escape
alive , the vessel
shall not
be adjudged
a wreck .
These animals ,
as in
Bracton , are only put for examples (9) , for it was held (r) ,
that not only if any live thing
escaped , but if proof
could
be made of the property
in any of the
goods
or
lading
which came to
shore, they
should
not
be forfeited
as
wreck .
The
statute
further
ordains
that
the
sheriff of
the county shall
be bound to keep the goods a year and
a day, so that if any man
can
prove a property in them ,
either
in his own right or by right of representation (s) ,
they may be restored to him without delay ; but if no
such property be proved within that time , they then shall
belong to the crown . If the goods
are
of a perishable
nature , the sheriff
may sell them , and the money shall be
liable in their
stead (t) .
This
revenue from wrecks was
frequently
granted
out to lords of manors ,
as
a royal
franchise .
It is to be observed
that , in order to constitute a legal
wreck , the
goods
must
come to land .
If they continue
at sea , the law distinguishes
them by the barbarous and
uncouth appellations ofjetsam , flotsam , and ligan , or lagan .
Jetsam is where goods
are
cast into
the
sea
to lighten
the
ship (u),
and there sink and
remain
under
water ;
flotsam is where they continue swimming
on the surface
of the waves
;
ligan or lagan
is where they are
sunk in
the sea but
tied
to a cork
or buoy , in order to be found
again (x) .
These also belong to the
crown , if no owner
appears to claim them ;
but if any owner
appears, he is
entitled
to recover the possession.
For even if goods be
cast overboard , without
any mark
or buoy , in order to
lighten the ship , the owner is not by this act of necessity
construed
to have renounced
his
property in them (y) ;

much less can things ligan be supposed to be abandoned ,
since the owner has done
all in his power to
assert and
retain his property .
These three are therefore accounted
so far distinct from the former , that by a grant from the
crown of wrecks , things jetsam , flotsam , and ligan will
not pass (z).
Wrecks, in their strict
legal acceptation , even formerly
were not frequent , for if any goods came to land , it rarely
happened that the owner was not able to assert his right
to them within the year and day limited by law.
And in
order to preserve this property entire for him, and if pos-
sible to prevent wrecks at all, our legislature
made many
humane regulations
(a) ; in a spirit quite opposite to those
savage
customs which
formerly prevailed in the northern
regions of Europe , permitting
the inhabitants
to seize on
whatever they could get as lawful prize : or as an author
of their
own
expresses
it , " in
naufragorum
miseria
et
calamitate tanquam vultures ad prædam currere " (b) .
The
statute
now
operative
upon
this
subject- which
has been amended by subsequent
enactments (c)-is the
17 & 18 Vict. c. 104 , by which wreck is defined to include
"jetsam , flotsam , ligan , and derelict (d) , found in or on
the shores of the sea , or any tidal water " (e) .

matters
relating
to wreck
are under the general superin-
tendence
of the board of trade , who appoint district
officers
denominated
receivers of wreck , to
perform
the various
duties
assigned
to them by the
legislature .
Amongst
such duties may be specified the rendering of assistance to
a vessel stranded
or in distress , the taking
possession of
her cargo , and protecting it from
plunder (g), the receiv-
ing of wreck
or seizure of it if concealed
( ) , the giving
notice of wreck to any lord of the manor , or other person
who may be entitled
to it if unclaimed by the owner (i) ,
and
effecting the sale of goods which are perishable or of
small value (k).
The proceeds
of the sale of wreck which
has become
vested in the crown by reason of non-claim are ,
during the life of her majesty , to be carried to and form
part of the consolidated fund , unless where they belong to
the queen in right of her
duchy of Lancaster , in which
case
they are to be paid to the receiver-general of such
duchy , and to be dealt with as part of the revenue thereof ,
or
unless where they belong to the duke of Cornwall , in
which
case they are to be dealt with
as part of the re-
venues of his duchy (1).
Above have been
set forth reasons why the crown
be-
came entitled to the several revenues
derivable from royal
fish , shipwrecks , treasure-trove, waifs , and estrays. Origi-
nally these things were treated
as bona vacantia , or goods
in which
no
one
else
could
claim
a property , wherefore
by the law of nature they belonged
to the first occupant
or finder (m) ; and so continued
under
the imperial law.
But in settling the modern
constitutions of most of the
governments of Europe , it was thought
fit
(
to
prevent
that strife
and contention
,
which
the mere title of occu-
pancy
is
apt
to
create

continue

THE ROYAL REVENUE .

the support
of public authority
in a manner the least
burthensome to individuals ) that
these rights
should be
annexed to the supreme power by the positive laws ofthe
state.
And so it came to pass that, as Bracton
expresses
it (n), hæc quæ nullius in bonis sunt, et olim fuerunt
inven-
toris
de jure naturali, jam
efficiuntur principis
de jure
gentium.
The
above various items of revenue were how-
ever formerly often granted by the crown as a royal fran-
chise to particular
subjects , ex. gr. , the lords of manors or
other liberties , to the perversion of their original design .
This may suffice for a short view of the
ordinary re-
nue of
the
venue
,
or
proper
patrimony
of
the crown
;
which was
very large
formerly
,
and capable
of
being
increased
to
a
magnitude truly formidable
:
for there are few estates
in
the kingdom
,
which
have
not
,
at
some
period
or
other
since the Norman
conquest
,
been vested
in
the hands
of
the
sovereign by forfeiture
,
escheat
,
or
otherwise
.
But
fortunately for the liberty
of
the subject
in
former
times
,
this hereditary landed revenue
,
by
a
series
of
improvident
management
,
sank almost
to
nothing
;
and the casual
profits
,
arising
from the
other
branches
of
the
census
regalis
,
became likewise almost all
of
them alienated from
the
crown
.
In
order
to
supply
the
deficiencies
thus
caused
,
we
are
now
obliged
to
have recourse
to
new
methods
of
raising
money
,
unknown
to
our
early ances-
tors
;
which methods constitute the extraordinary
revenue
of
the crown
.
For
,
the public
patrimony
having got into
the hands
of
private
subjects
,
it
was but reasonable that
private contributions
should supply the public
service
.
The thing
to
be
aimed
at
in
this land
of
liberty
is
by no
means the total abolition
of
taxes
,
which could
not be
effected
,
and the bare supposition
of
which might justly
be deemed
absurd
.
Our legislators
should
rather strive
to
keep
in
mind
the
soundest
principles
of
taxation
.
For the true
idea
of
government
and
magistracy
will

be found to consist in this , that , as some few men are
deputed by many
others to
preside
over
public
affairs ,
so that individuals
may the better
be enabled to attend
to
their
private
concerns , it is
necessary that
those
individuals
should
be bound
to
contribute
a portion of
their private gains , in order to support that government ,
and reward that
magistracy which
protects them in the
enjoyment of their
respective properties .
But the things
to be aimed at
are wisdom
and moderation , not
only in
granting , but also in the method of raising the necessary
supplies ; by contriving
to do both in such a manner as
may be most conducive to the national welfare , and at the
same time most consistent with economy
and the liberty of
the
subject ; who , when properly
taxed , contributes
only
some part of his property , in order to enjoy the rest.

These extraordinary
grants (which were formerly
called of aids, sub.
by the synonymous names of aids , subsidies , and supplies )
are made, as we have seen (0) , by the commons of Great commons.
Britain
in parliament
assembled : who when they have
voted a supply to her majesty , and settled the quantum of
that supply , usually resolve themselves into what is called
a committee of ways and means, to consider the ways and
means of raising the supply
so voted .
And in this com-
mittee
every member (though it is looked upon
as the
peculiar province of the chancellor of the exchequer ) may
propose such scheme of
taxation
as he thinks will be
least detrimental
to the public .
The resolutions of this
committee , when approved by a vote of the house, are in
general
esteemed
to be (as it were) final
and conclusive .
For , though the supply cannot be actually raised upon the
subject till directed by an act of parliament , yet the chan-
cellor of the exchequer is practically
authorised
to obtain
an advance of money for the use of the government , on
the credit of a bare vote of the house of commons , though
no law be yet passed
to establish it.

THE
ROYAL
REVENUE .
(I.) Land-
t.ix.
The taxes raised upon the subject are either perpetual
or for a term certain , but disregarding
this distinction ,
which
for the purposes of the present
chapter is imma-
terial , we shall proceed to consider
seriatim the principal
imposts now levied on the public.
I.
The land -tax , in its modern
shape, has
superseded
all
the former
methods
of
rating
either
property , or
persons in respect of their property , whether by tenths
or
fifteenths ,
subsidies
on
land ,
hydages ,
scutages
,
or tallages ; a short explication
of which
will , however ,
greatly assist us in understanding
our ancient laws and
history .
Tenths and fifteenths (p) were temporary aids issuing
out of personal
property , and granted
to the
crown by
parliament .
They
were formerly
the
actual
tenth
or
fifteenth
part of all
moveables
belonging
to the sub-
ject ;
when
such moveables ,
or
personal
estates ,
were
much less considerable than they are at this day.
Tenths
are said to have been first granted under Henry II. , who
took
advantage of the
fashionable
zeal
for crusades
to
introduce this new taxation , in order to defray the expense
of an expedition to Palestine , which he really or seemingly
had
projected against
Saladin , emperor of the Saracens ;
whence it was denominated
the
Saladin tenth (9) .
But
afterwards fifteenths were more often granted than tenths .
Originally the amount of these taxes was uncertain , being
levied by assessments newly made at every fresh grant of
the
commons , a commission
for which
is preserved by
Matthew Paris (r) : but it was at length
reduced to a
certainty in the
eighth
year of Edward III . , when , by
virtue of the king's commission , new taxations were made
of every township , borough , and city in the kingdom , and
recorded in the
exchequer : which
rate was, at the time ,

the fifteenth
part of the
value
of every township , the
whole amounting
to about 29,000 /. , and therefore it still
kept up the name of a fifteenth , when , by the alteration
of the value of money and the increase of personal property ,
things came to be in a very different
situation .
So that
when , of later years , the
commons granted
the king a
fifteenth , every parish
in England immediately
knew the
proportion
of it which its inhabitants
would have to pay,
viz. the identical
sum that was assessed by the same
aid
in the eighth year of Edward III.; and then raised it by
a local rate, and returned it into the royal exchequer.
The other ancient levies were in the nature of a modern
land-tax
for we may trace up the origin of that charge
to the introduction
of our military tenures ( s) ; when every
tenant
of
a knight's fee was bound , if called upon , to
attend
the king in his army for forty days in every year .
But this personal attendance growing troublesome in many
respects , the tenants found means of compounding for it ,
by first sending
others in their stead , and in
process
of
time by making
a pecuniary satisfaction
to the crown in
lieu of it.
This pecuniary
satisfaction
at last came to be
levied by assessment, at so much for every knight's fee ,
under the name of scutage ; which
appears
to have been
levied for the first time in the fifth year of Henry II. , on
account of his
expedition
to Toulouse , and was
then
a
mere arbitrary
composition ,
such
as the king
and the
subject
could
agree
upon .
But
this precedent
being
afterwards
abused into a means of oppression (in levying
scutages on the landholders
by the royal authority
only ,
whenever our kings went to war , in order to hire merce-
nary troops , and pay their contingent expenses ) , it became
thereupon a matter of national complaint
; and king John
was obliged
to promise in his
magna carta ( t) , that
no
scutage should
be imposed without the consent of the
common council of the
realm .

omitted in the charter of Henry III. (u) , where we only find
it stipulated , that scutages
should
be taken
as they were
used to be in the time of Henry II.
Yet afterwards , by a
variety of statutes under Edward I. , and his grandson (x),
it was provided that the king should not take any aids or
tasks , any tallage or tax , but by the common assent of the
great men and commons in parliament .
Of the same nature with scutages upon knights ' fees
were the assessments of hydage upon all other lands , and
of tallage
upon
cities and boroughs (y) .
But they all
gradually fell into disuse upon the introduction
of subsi-
dies, about the time of Richard II. and Henry IV .
These
were in effect
taxes, not immediately
imposed upon
pro-
perty , but upon persons in respect of their reputed estates ,
after
the nominal
rate of 4s. in the pound for lands , and
2s. 8d. for goods ; and for those of aliens in a double pro-
portion .
But this assessment
was also made according
to
an ancient
valuation
; wherein
the
computation
was
so
very moderate , and the rental of the kingdom was sup-
posed to be so exceedingly low, that
one
subsidy of this
sort did not , according to sir Edward
Coke (2) , amount to
more than
70,000l .
It was anciently
the rule never
to
grant more than one subsidy and two fifteenths at a time :
but this
rule was broken
through for the first time on a
very
pressing
occasion, the
Spanish
invasion
in
1588 ;
when the parliament
gave queen Elizabeth two subsidies
and four fifteenths .
Afterwards
, as money sunk in value ,
more subsidies were given ; and we have an instance in
the first parliament of 1640 , of the king's desiring
twelve
subsidies of the
commons , to be levied in three years ;
which was looked
upon
as a startling
proposal : though
lord Clarendon
says (a ) , that the speaker , serjeant Glan-
ville, made it manifest to the house , how inconsiderable

sum
twelve
subsidies
amounted
to , by telling them he
had computed what he was to pay for them himself ; and
when he named the sum , he being known to be possessed
of a great
estate, it seemed
not worth
any further deli-
beration .
The grant of scutages ,
tallages ,
or
subsidies by the
commons did not extend to spiritual preferments
; those
being usually taxed at the same time by the clergy them-
selves
in convocation : which
grants of the clergy , how-
ever, unless
confirmed in parliament , were not binding :
as the same noble writer
observes of the subsidies granted
by the convocation ,
which
continued
sitting
after
the
dissolution
of the first parliament
in
1640.
A subsidy
granted
by the clergy
was after the rate
of 4s. in the
pound
according
to the valuation
of their livings in the
king's books
and amounted ,
as sir Edward
Coke tells
us ( ) , to about 20,0007.
While
this
custom continued ,
convocations
were wont
to sit
as
frequently
as
parlia-
ments : but
the last
subsidies , thus given by the clergy ,
were those confirmed by statute
15
Car .
2 , c. 10 , since
which another method of taxation , taking in the clergy as
well as the laity , has generally prevailed .
The lay subsidy
was usually
raised by commissioners
appointed by the crown , or the great officers of state : and
therefore in the
beginning
of the
civil
wars
between
Charles I. and his parliament , the latter
having no other
sufficient
revenue to support
themselves and their mea-
sures ,
introduced
the
practice
of
laying
weekly
and
monthly assessments (c) of a specific
sum upon
the se-
veral counties of the kingdom
; to be levied by a pound-
rate on lands and personal estates ; which were occasionally
continued
during
the conflict , sometimes at the rate of
120,000l . a month , sometimes at inferior
rates (d).

instead of such monthly
assessments , was once , and once
only ,
renewed ; viz . in
1663 , when
four
subsidies
were
granted by the temporality , and four by the clergy .
The
statute
22 &
23 Car .
2 , c. 3, was indeed entitled
" An act for granting
a subsidy to his majesty for supply
of his extraordinary
occasions " (e), and by this act, inter
alia, a tax of 1s. in the
pound was imposed on land , but
the mode of levying it was not similar
to that of levying
the true subsidy .
Yet
a popular
opinion
has prevailed ,
that
the land-tax
was first introduced
in the
reign
of
William III. (f) ; because
in the year 1692 a new assess-
ment
or valuation
of
estates
was made throughout
the
kingdom
which, though by no means perfect , had this
effect, that a supply of 500,000l . was
equal
to
18. in the
pound of the value of the estates
given in. And according
to this
enhanced valuation , from
the year
1693
to the
present time , the land -tax has continued
a charge upon
the subject ; varied in amount
at different
periods , but
without any total intermission .
The method of raising it
is by charging
a particular
sum upon each county , accord-
ing to the valuation
given
A.D.
1692
: and this
sum is
assessed
and raised upon individuals
(g) , by commissioners
appointed in the act, being the principal landholders
of
the county , and their
officers .
This tax which
for up-
wards of a century
was annual , is now made perpetual ,
and subject to redemption ( ).

The
last
annual
act
for
granting
a land-tax ,
was
the
38
Geo. 3, c. 5.
This act was amended
and
extended by 38 Geo. 3, c. 48,
and the tax was made perpetual
and
subject to redemption
by 38 Geo. 3,
c. 60 ; which last mentioned
act was
amended by 42 Geo. 3, c. 116. The
consideration
for redemption
of the
land-tax , is, with some exceptions ,
so much
capital
stock of the
three
per cent . consolidated
annuities , or
reduced
annuities ,
as will yield a
dividend

the
amount of
the land -tax redeemed by one-tenth

keep up the ports
and havens , and to protect
the mer-
chant from pirates .
Some have said that the duties in
question were called customs , as being the inheritance of
the crown by immemorial
usage and the
common law,
and not granted to it by any statute (m) ; but sir Edward
Coke
has shown (2) , that
the king's
first
claim to them
was by grant of parliament , 3 Edw . I. , though the record
thereof
is not now extant .
And indeed this is in express
words
confessed by statute
25 Edw .
1 (o) , c. 7, wherein
the king
promises
to take
no
customs from merchants
without the common assent of the
realm , " saving to us
and
our
heirs , the customs
on
wool , skins , and leather ,
formerly
granted
to us by the
commonalty
aforesaid .”
These were
called
the
hereditary
customs of the crown ;
and were due on the
exportation
only of the said three
commodities , and of none
other ;
which were styled
the
staple
commodities
of the
kingdom ,
because
they were
obliged
to be brought
to
those ports where the king's
staple was established , in order to be there first rated , and
then exported (p ) . They were denominated in the barbarous
Latin of our ancient
records , custumæ (q) ;
not consuetu-
dines, which is the language of our law whenever it means
merely usages .
The duties on wool , sheep - skins , or wool-
fels , and leather , exported , were called
custuma
antiqua
sive magna, and were payable by every merchant , as well
native
as stranger ;
with this difference , that merchant-
strangers
were required
to pay an additional
toll ,
viz . ,
half as much again as was paid by natives .
The custuma

But
these ancient hereditary customs , especially those on wool
and woolfels , were of little account , when the nation
had
become sensible of the advantages of home manufacture ,
and had prohibited
the exportation
of wool by statute
11
Edw . 3, c.
1 ( s). This prohibition
modified and enforced by
many succeeding statutes , continued till a comparatively
recent period ; and in the
earlier
part of this century ,
heavy duties were laid on the
importation
of wool , but
now all these duties
are
repealed , and the trade

fectly free both for exports and imports (s).

There was also
another
very
ancient
hereditary
duty Prisage or
belonging to the crown , called the prisage , or butlerage of
wines ;
which
is considerably
older
than
the
customs ,
being taken notice of in the great roll of the exchequer , 8
Richard
1 , still extant
(t).
Prisage was
a right of taking
two tons of wine
from every
ship
(English
or foreign )
importing into England twenty tons or
more , one before
and one behind the mast ; which by charter of Edward I.
was
exchanged
into a duty of 2s. for every ton imported
by merchant - strangers , and called butlerage , because
paid
to the king's butler (u).
Other customs payable upon
exports and imports
were
distinguished
into
subsidies ,
tonnage ,
poundage ,
&c.
Subsidies were such as were imposed by parliament
upon
any of the staple commodities
before
mentioned , over and
above the custuma antiqua et magna :
tonnage was a duty
upon all wines imported , over and above the prisage and

poundage
was a duty
imposed
ad
valorem , at the rate of 12d. in the pound , on all other
merchandise whatsoever ; and the other imposts were such
as were
occasionally
laid
on by parliament ,
as circum-
stances and times
required (x) .
These distinctions
are
now almost forgotten , the produce of all
duties
on im-
ports
being
blended together , under the
one
denomina-
tion of the customs .
By these we understand , at present , a duty or subsidy
paid by the merchant , at the quay, upon all imported
as
well as exported commodities , by the authority of parlia-
ment ;
unless
where ,
for
particular
national
reasons ,
certain
rewards , bounties , or drawbacks
are allowed
in
respect of
certain
exports
and
imports .
The dues of
tonnage and poundage , in particular , were at first granted ,
as the old statutes (and especially
1 Eliz . c. 20 ) , express
it, for the defence of the realm , and the keeping
and safe-
guard of the seas , and for " the intercourse of merchandise "
safely to come into and pass out of the same.
They were
at first usually granted only for a stated term of years , as
for two years in 5 Ric . II. ( y ) ; but in Henry VI.'s time ,
they were granted him for life by a statute in the thirty-
first year of his reign ( ) , and again to Edward IV. , for the
term of his life
also (a) ;
since which time they
were
regularly granted to all his successors
for life, sometimes
at the first , sometimes
at a subsequent parliament , until
the
reign of Charles I.;
when
as Lord
Clarendon
ex-
presses it (b) , his ministers were not sufficiently
solicitous
for a renewal of this
legal
grant .
And
yet
these
im-
posts were imprudently
and unconstitutionally
levied and
taken , without
consent of parliament ,
for fifteen
years
together , which was one of the
causes of those unhappy
discontents , justifiable
in
too many instances , but which

at last caused civil war (c) , though in this particular
case
the king (previous to the commencement
of hostilities )
gave the nation
satisfaction for the errors of his
former
conduct , by passing an
act (d) , whereby he renounced all
power in the crown of levying
the
duty of tonnage
and
poundage , without the express
consent of parliament
;
and also all power of imposition
upon any merchandises
whatever .
Upon the Restoration
this duty
was granted
to king Charles II. for life , and so it was to
his two im-
mediate
successors
;
but
afterwards
by three
several
statutes , 9 Ann . c. 6,
1 Geo.
1 , c. 12 , and 3 Geo. 1 , c. 7,
it was made perpetual , and mortgaged for the debt of the
public .
The
customs thus
imposed
by parliament
were
chiefly contained in two books of rates, set forth by par-
liamentary
authority (e) ;
one
signed by sir
Harbottle
Grimston , speaker of the house of commons in Charles
II.'s time , and the
other an additional
one signed by sir
Spencer Compton , speaker in the reign
of George I. , to
which also subsequent additions were made.
Until the year 1787 , great confusion and perplexity
pre-
vailed in the law relating
to the customs .
Besides
the
duties enumerated in the above two books of rates , various
others had been imposed from
time
to time , and the ac-
cumulation
of these
duties
became
at length
a great
embarrassment to commerce , as the merchant
found con-
siderable difficulty
in
ascertaining
the
amount
to which
he was liable.
Under the first
Customs
Consolidation
Act (f) the
collection
of
the
customs
was in
some
degree
improved
by abolishing
all the duties
then sub-
sisting ,
and
declaring
the
above -mentioned
two
books
of rates to be of no authority , and substituting in their
stead one single duty on each article , amounting
as nearly
as possible to the aggregate of all the various duties then

payable thereupon ; when
any duty
consisted of
a frac-
tional
sum, the
nearest integral
number being
charged .
A systematic
and uniform
simplicity was, at the
same
time ,
introduced
into
the
custom -house
accounts , by
which
a more distinct
view has
been
obtained
both of
the
total
amount
of this
important
branch
of
the
revenue and of the various
sources
from
which it is de-
rived .
The
act referred to
regulated
the customs until
1826 , when all prior enactments
were repealed , and the
customs
acts
consolidated .
This operation was repeated
in the reign of William IV. , and again
by various
acts
in the present
reign .
The
effect
of the present legisla-
tion has been to repeal the majority
of the
duties for-
merly
charged
and to
confine the customs to compa-
ratively
few articles , the principal of which
are wines ,
spirits , tea , coffee , sugar , and tobacco .
Aliens were for-
merly
compelled
to pay heavier duties than natural
born
subjects , to be exempted from which was one of the prin-
cipal causes of the frequent applications to parliament
for
acts of naturalization
; but by 24 Geo . 3 , sess . 2 , c . 16 , all
previously
existing
duties
on the
goods of aliens
above
those paid by natural
born
subjects were repealed (with
the exception
of the duties of package and
scavage (g)
payable in the City of
London ) ,
the
preamble
of
the
act reciting
that such duties
had " become
an unneces-
sary burden
upon
commerce without
producing
any real
advantage to the public revenue."
In 1833 the duties of
package
and
scavage
were purchased from the civic
cor-
poration by the government , and , the duties themselves
being ,
at the
same
time , abolished ( ) , aliens
are now
called upon to pay no more than other persons .
These customs are then , we see , a tax immediately
paid
by the
merchant , although
ultimately
by the consumer .
And yet these
are the duties felt least
by the people ;

and , if prudently
managed , the people hardly
consider
that they pay them at all.
For the
merchant
is
easy ,
being
sensible he
does
not pay them for himself ;
and
the consumer , who
really
pays
them , confounds
them
with the price of the commodity ; in the same manner ,
as Tacitus
observes , that the
emperor Nero
gained
the
reputation
of abolishing
the tax on the sale of
slaves ,
though
he
only
transferred it from
the
buyer
to the
seller ;
so that it was,
as
he
expresses
it, " remissum
magis specie , quam vi ; quia cum venditor penderejuberetur ,
in partem pretii
emptoribus
accrescebat " (i).
But this in-
convenience
attends
on the imposing
of custom duties ,
that the imposts
levied , if too
heavy, are a check and
cramp upon trade : and especially when the value of the
commodity
bears little or no proportion
to the quantity of
the duty imposed .
This gives
rise
also to smuggling
,
which
then
becomes
a very lucrative
employment :
and
its natural
and most reasonable punishment , viz . , confis-
cation of the commodity , is in such cases quite ineffectual ;
the intrinsic value of the
goods , which
is all that the
smuggler
has paid , and therefore all
that
he
can
lose ,
being very inconsiderable
when
compared with his pro-
spect
of advantage
in
evading
the
duty .
Recourse
must therefore
be had to extraordinary
punishments
to
prevent it (k) ,
which ,
besides
other
objections
to them
are apt to confound men's notions of right and wrong by
visiting breaches of mere fiscal regulations , with penalties
as severe
as those inflicted
for crimes of violence .
There
is
also another
ill
consequence
attending
high
imposts
on merchandise
,
not
frequently
considered
,
but
indisputably
certain
;
that the earlier
any tax
is
laid
on
a
commodity
the heavier
it
falls upon the consumer
in
the
end
;
for every trader through whose hands
it
passes must
have
a
profit
,
not only upon the
raw material
,
and his
own labour and
time
in
preparing
it
,
but also upon the

very tax itself, which
he
advances
to the government
;
otherwise he loses the use and interest of the money which
he so advances. For instance , when there was an impost on
foreign paper, the merchant paid
a
duty upon
importa-
tion , which he did not receive again till he sold the com-
modity , perhaps at the end of three months . He was there-
fore equally entitled to a profit upon that
duty which he
paid at the custom house, as to a profit upon the original
price
which
he paid to the manufacturer
abroad :
and
considered it accordingly in the price he demanded of the
stationer .
When the stationer
sold it again , he required
a profit
from the printer
or bookseller
upon
the
whole
sum
advanced by him to the
merchant
; and the book-
seller did not forget to charge the full proportion to the
student
or
ultimate
consumer , who therefore
not
only
paid the original duty , but
the
profits
of these
three
intermediate
traders , who
had
successively
advanced
it
for him.
This, which might be carried
much
farther in
any mechanical or more complicated branch of trade , was
a very
serious
inconvenience ,
but it
has
been
much
diminished by the introduction
of the warehousing system ,
a great
and important
improvement
in
our
commercial
law.
Previously
to 1803 , the duties
on most goods im-
ported were either paid at the
moment of their importa-
tion , or
a bond , with sufficient
security
for their future
payment , was given to the revenue
officers .
The hard-
ships and inconveniences of such a system are numerous
and obvious ( ).
Sir
Robert
Walpole
seems
to have been one of the
first who had a clear perception of its injurious
influence ,
and one object of that
minister's
famous
excise
scheme ,
proposed in 1733 , was to oblige the importers
of tobacco
and wine to deposit their importations
in public
ware-
houses ,
relieving
them , however, from the necessity of
paying the duties chargeable on the importations till they

for home consumption (m).
Sir Robert's
proposed
scheme ,
however , was met by violent
popular
clamour , and was therefore unavoidably dropped . However ,
fifty years afterwards , by 43 Geo . 3 , c. 132 , the provisions
of which were improved , and extended by subsequent sta-
tutes (n), the commissioners of customs were empowered,
under
the
authority
and direction
of the lords
of the
treasury , to nominate the ports
at which
goods
may be
warehoused without
payment of duty , and the warehouses
in which particular
descriptions of goods may be deposited .
There are various regulations
respecting the
time
during
which goods
are
allowed
to
remain in the warehouse ;
their removal from port to port , their
sale and stowage in
the warehouses , the remission of the duties in case of loss
by accident , the allowances
for
waste , &c.
If imported
goods

being

a strict
watch is kept , make it necessary
, wherever it is established ,
to give the officers a power of entering and searching the
houses of such as deal
in
or
manufacture excisable com-
modities , at any hour of the
day , and , in some cases , of
the night likewise .
And the proceedings in case of trans-
gressions
are
often
summary ,
and
in
some
instances
held
before the
commissioners
of

themselves ,
instead of a legal tribunal
(0).
For which reason , though
lord Clarendon tells us (p) , that to his knowledge the earl
of Bedford (who was made lord treasurer by king Charles
I. , to
oblige
his
parliament ) intended to have set up the
excise in England , yet it never made a part of that unfor-
tunate
prince's
revenue ;
being first
introduced
on
the
model of the Dutch prototype , by the parliament
itself
after
its rupture
with the
crown .
Yet
such
was
the
opinion
of its
general unpopularity
, that when
in
1642
aspersions
were
cast by
malignant
persons
upon
the
house of commons , that they intended to introduce excises ,
the house for its vindication
therein did declare , that these
rumours
were
false

However ,
its
original
(r)
establish-
ment
was in
1643
(s),
and its
progress
was
gradual ;
being
at first laid upon those persons and commodities
where it was
supposed the hardship
would
be
the least
perceivable , viz ., the
makers
and vendors of beer,
ale ,
cider , and
perry (t) ; and the royalists
at
Oxford
soon
followed
the
example
of their brethren
at
Westmin-
ster by imposing
a similar
duty ;
both
sides protesting
that it should
be continued
no longer
than
to the end
of the war , and
then
be utterly abolished (u) .
But the
parliament
at Westminster
soon after imposed it on flesh ,
wine , tobacco , sugar , and such a multitude
of other com-
modities , that it might fairly
be
denominated
general :
in pursuance
of the plan laid
down
by Mr. Pym
(who
seems to have been the father of the excise), in
his letter
to sir John Hotham
(x) , signifying , " that they had pro-
ceeded in the excise to many particulars , and intended to
go on further ; but that it would be necessary to use the
people to it by little and little."
And
afterwards , when
the nation
had
been
accustomed to it for
a
series
of
years , the
succeeding
champions of liberty boldly and
openly
declared " the
impost
of
excise to be the
most
easy and
indifferent
levy that
could
be laid

The

(Lond.

informs
us, that it was first moved
for, 28 Mar.
1643, by Mr.
Prynne .
And it
appears
from the journals
of the commons , that on that day
the
house
resolved
itself into
a
committee
to
consider
of raising

people " (y);
and
accordingly
continued
it
during the
whole usurpation .
Upon king Charles's
return , it having
then been long established , and its produce well -known ,
some part of it was given to the crown in 12 Car . II . , by
way of purchase (as was before observed) for the feudal te-
nures and other oppressive parts of the hereditary revenue.
But , from
its origin to a comparatively
recent
period , it
has
been
extremely
unpopular .
It was ,
nevertheless ,
imposed
on many
commodities
other than those
before
mentioned in the reigns of king William III. and suc-
ceeding princes , to support the enormous
expenses
occa-
sioned by our wars on the continent .
Thus
excise
duties were levied
on spirits , hops , malt ,
beer, soap , glass , salt ,
paper , &c. , indeed
on nearly every
article in daily use.
Now, however , many of the
most
objectionable of these duties have
been
repealed , and
the
excise is levied in much
fewer instances , the principal
part of the revenue arising
therefrom
being derived from
malt and spirits .
V.
Another
considerable
portion
of
the
revenue is
contributed
with
greater
cheerfulness ,
as ,
instead
of
being
a burden , it is for the manifest
advantage of the
public . I mean the duty for the carriage of letters .
It does
not appear at what precise date the crown un-
dertook to be the regular carrier of letters for
its
subjects
.
The
crown
,
doubtless
,
at
a
very
early period
,
found
it
necessary
to
the functions
of
sovereignty
,
to
be
able
to
convey
,
with speed
and security
,
its own despatches
from
one part
of
the realm
to
another
,
and from and
to
parts
beyond the seas
;
and for that purpose
it
appointed certain
messengers
or
runners
called
the
posts
.
These posts
were also employed for the personal
convenience
of
the
sovereign
and the individuals
composing the royal court
.
In

of
time
a

of
the posts was

POST-OFFICE .
385
and the first of these on record was sir Brian Tuke , who
held that office
in
1516.
His joint
successors
were sir
William
Paget
and John
Mason (~),
and
there
were
successive
patents granting
the
same
office to other per-
sons
temp .
Elizabeth, James I.
and
Charles
I.
The
practice
probably
began at an
early
period ,
and
after-
wards
grew into
a regular
custom
of allowing
private
persons to avail themselves of the royal
posts for trans-
mitting their correspondence, and
this
practice ,
besides
yielding perquisites to the
postmaster , gave to
ministers
of state
the power
of narrowly
inspecting
the written
correspondence of the public .
In
The officer hitherto mentioned as the king's postmaster ,
was the master of the posts within the
dominions
of the
crown at home or beyond the
seas , and to him belonged
the transmission of letters both at home and abroad .
1619 , however , a new patent office was established , called
that of the postmaster of England for foreign parts out of
the dominions of the crown , which gave rise to a protracted
legal contest between rival claimants (a) . During the reign
of Charles
I. the postmaster , Thomas Witherings ,
sug-
gested
improvements
in the
management of the post-
office ,
which ,
at
that
time ,
instead
of producing
any
revenue to the state, caused an
annual
burden
to it of
34007.
His plan consisted essentially of three parts- the
establishment
of fixed rates of postage ; the substitution
of horse for
foot -posts , and a concession to the public
generally
of the
use of the
post -office .
The
plan
was
adopted ,
and
Witherings
was

In

a bill
for the settling of the postage
of
England,
Scotland ,
and Ireland,
was laid by order of
the Protector , before his parliament , and passed with some
amendments (b).
After the
Restoration ,
an
office
similar to that of
postmaster
was
established
by the
12 Car . 2 , c. 35 , but
the
rates
of
letters
were
altered ,
further
regulations
were
added
by
various
statutes ,
and
penalties
were
enacted , in order to confine , except in some few
cases ,
the carriage of letters to the public office only .
In the year 1837 , the laws
relating
to the post-office
were amended .
By 7 Will . 4 & 1 Vict. c. 33 , the exclusive
privilege
of conveying letters was, with some exceptions ,

on letters were reduced to one uniform
rate of
one penny
charged
on

not
exceeding half an ounce in

increase for greater weights

VI. Stamp duties constitute another
important
branch (VI.) Stamp
of the revenue
of the
crown , being
imposed
upon
many
legal (e) and mercantile documents .
They
were
first in-
stituted by 5 & 6 W.
& M. c. 21 , and have been added
to
and altered by other statutes
too numerous
to
mention .
This is a tax , which , though in some
instances it may be
heavily felt by increasing
the expense of mercantile
as
well
as legal
transactions , yet , if moderately imposed , is
of service
by authenticating
instruments , and rendering it
much more
difficult
than formerly to forge
deeds
of any
standing ;
since ,
as the
officers of this branch
of the
revenue vary their
stamps
frequently , a man that would
forge a deed of any particular
time must know and be able
to
counterfeit the
stamp of that date also .
Two
other
taxes may be mentioned which
also
come under our pre-
sent head,
viz ., the legacy duty (ƒ) and the
succession
warrant
was
constantly
issued
to
the
postmaster -general
directing
the allowance
thereof to the
extent
of two
ounces in weight
; till
at
length it
was
expressly
confirmed
by statute 4 Geo. 3.
c. 24 ; which
added
many new
regulations ,
ren-
dered necessary by the great abuses
which had
crept
into the practice
of franking : see

are duties assessed
on individuals
annually , in respect of articles used by them , the principal
duties
leviable under this head
being those on inhabited
houses (g), servants , horses, carriages , and armorial

Dogs were formerly
charged for under this

licence imposed in lieu thereof on such as keep them (h) .

permis-
sion
obtained
on payment
of money ,
without
which
a
person is not allowed
to do a certain act or, may be , to
carry on a certain trade.
Licences falling under this head
are very numerous , comprising
inter alia those required by
auctioneers , pawnbrokers ,
brewers , horse -dealers , publi-
cans, and persons who shoot and deal in game , or keep
dogs. Analogous
to these duties are the certificates , which
must be taken out by special pleaders , conveyancers , and
attornies , before they are allowed
to practise .
Most
of
these duties are under the management
of and collected
by the commissioners of the excise (i).

NATIONAL
DEBT .

of taxes.
debt.
Much of the revenue derivable
from the sources
above
Application
enumerated is applicable
to the payment of the national
debt , the origin and nature whereof we will next consider .
In order to take
a clear
and
comprehensive
view
of National
the nature of the national debt , it must first be premised ,
that after the Revolution , when our new connections
with
Europe
introduced
a new system
of foreign
politics , the
expenses of the nation , not only in settling
the new esta-
blishment , but in maintaining
long wars , as principals , on
the
continent
for the security
of the
Dutch
barrier ,
reducing
the
French
monarchy ,
settling
the
Spanish
succession , supporting
the house of Austria , maintaining
the liberties of the
Germanic
body , and other purposes ,
increased to an unusual
degree ; insomuch that it was not
thought advisable to raise all the expenses
of any one year
by taxes to be levied within that year , lest the unaccus-
tomed weight of them should create murmurs
among the
people .
It
was therefore
the policy
of the
times to
anticipate
the revenues of their posterity , by borrowing
large
sums for the current service of the state , and to lay
no
more
taxes
upon
the
subject
than
would
suffice
to pay the
annual interest of the sums so borrowed , by
this
means
converting
the
principal
debt
into
a new
species
of property , transferable from one man to another ,
at
any time , and in any quantity .
An early instance of
this
system

ment of that state then
owing
about
60,000l . sterling ,
and being unable
to pay it, formed the principal

aggregate sum , called ,
metaphorically
, a mount or bank ,
the shares
whereof were transferable like our stocks , with
interest at 5 per cent. , the prices varying according to the

exigencies of the
state (k).
This policy
of the English
parliament
laid
the
foundation
of what
is
called
the
national
debt :
for
a few long
annuities
created
in the
reign of Charles II. will hardly
deserve
that name.
And
the example then set has been so closely followed during the
long wars in the reign of queen Anne, and since , that the
capital
of the
national
debt
(funded
and
unfunded )
amounted in
1867
to
about seven hundred and seventy-
seven millions , to pay the
interest of which the
country
has to bear an annual burden of over twenty -six millions .
The system
above
mentioned , though
recourse to it may
be sometimes
needed ,
is open to the
objection
that it
weakens the internal strength of a
state, by anticipating
those resources
which
should
be
reserved
to defend it in
case of necessity .
The interest we now pay for our debts
might be
nearly
sufficient
to
maintain
any
war ,
that
national motives could require .
The products
of the
several
taxes imposed
upon
the
nation were originally
separate and
distinct
funds , being
securities for the sums advanced on
each several tax , and
for them only .
But at last it became
necessary
, in order
to avoid
confusion , as they
multiplied
yearly , to reduce
the number of these separate
funds , by uniting
and blend-
ing them
together , superadding
the
faith
of parliament
for the general security of the whole .
They were accord-
ingly first reduced into three capital funds : the aggregate
fund , and the general fund , so called from such union and
addition ;
and the
South
Sea fund , being the produce of
the taxes appropriated to pay the interest of such part of
the national
debt as was advanced by that
company and
its annuitants .
These separate funds were made mutual
securities for
each
other , and the whole produce of them
thus
aggregated
became
liable
to
pay such
interest
or
annuities
as
had been formerly
charged upon
each
dis-
tinct
fund , the faith of the legislature
being
pledged
to

CONSOLIDATED
FUND .

supply
any
casual
deficiencies .
Afterwards ,
by
stat .
27 Geo . 3, c. 13 , ss. 47, et seq. , these three funds
were
united
together
into
the " consolidated
fund ; " and by
56 Geo. 3, c. 98 , the consolidated
fund of Great Britain
was combined with that of Ireland , forming
the consoli-
dated fund of the United
Kingdom, which is pledged for
the payment of the interest of the national debt, besides
being liable to the
payment of the
allowances
to the
royal family
and
the
expenses
of the civil government
charged thereupon , as subsequently explained ( 7).
The
customs ,
excise ,
and
other
taxes, which
are to
support
these funds ,
depending
on
contingencies , must
necessarily be of a very uncertain
amount ;
but though
some of them
have
proved
unproductive ,
and
others
deficient , the sum total
has
sometimes been considerably
more than was sufficient to answer the charge upon them .
The surplusses therefore of the three great national funds ,
the
aggregate , general , and
South
Sea
funds , over and
above the interest
and
annuities
charged
upon
them ,
were directed by stat. 3 Geo . 1 , c. 7 , to be carried together ,
and to attend the disposition
of parliament
;
and were
usually
denominated
the sinking fund , because
destined
to
sink
and
lower
the
national
debt.
To this
fund
were added many other duties , subsequently granted .
Further , by
26 Geo . 3 , c . 31 , the
sum of one million
annually
was set apart and ordered to be laid out in the
purchase
of stock
by
commissioners
appointed
by the
same
act ; it being
also provided , that when this annual
million
should
be increased to four millions by the divi-
dends of the
stock
so
purchased ,
then
the
dividends
should
no longer
be paid upon the redeemed
stock ,
and
that the sinking fund
should
no longer accumulate .
By
32
Geo 3,
c. 55 , it was
enacted , that
when
these
divi-
dends should
amount to three millions , exclusive of the
said annual grant, there should
be no further accumula-
tion ; it being also provided , that upon every future loan

THE

REVENUE .
which was not to be paid
off within forty -five years , one
per
cent .
should
be
annually
appropriated
to form
a
sinking fund for the redemption
of the
loan ; and by 33
Geo . 3, c. 22, an additional grant of 200,000l . was made
for the same purpose .
At last the nation became
alive to the folly of contract-
ing debt for the purpose of paying it off (n) , and aware of
the fact that the only rational mode of forming
a sinking
fund was by applying
to that purpose the excess of revenue
over expenditure .
An attempt was made in 1819 to form
a sinking fund of five millions by maintaining
a surplus
revenue of this amount .
As it was soon
found that this
could
not be done , the whole
system was ended in 1829
by 10
Geo . 4 , c. 27, which
enacted
that the sum appli-
cable in future
to the
diminution
of the national
debt
should be a certain
portion of the
excess , if any , of the
annual revenue.
This sum is accordingly
annually trans-
ferred
to the
commissioners
for the
reduction
of the
national
debt ,
together
with
unclaimed
dividends
( 0),
and such
sums as are from time to time bequeathed to
them
for that
purpose ( p) .
But before any part of the
aggregate fund can be applied to diminish
the principal
of the public
debt , it stands
mortgaged by parliament
to
raise
an annual
sum for the maintenance
of the royal
household and the civil list.
Before the
Revolution , the sovereign
had the uncon-
trolled disposal of the revenues
of the crown (q), including

com-

at least ) that it did not amount to so
much (Ib . 4 June , 1663, Lord Clar .

But it
must
be

that under

both the hereditary
revenues
and the taxes, and whatever
remained
after
defraying
the
necessary
expenses
of the
government , was at his absolute disposal , for the main-
tenance of his dignity and for private
purposes .
Irre-
spective of this
provision , Charles II. appropriated
to his
private
use immense
sums voted by parliament
for other
purposes (r).
To prevent
such
conduct
being
possible
thereafter , a separate
provision was made for the civil list
at the accession of William
and Mary ( s) , though
this
list was not
only burdened with the royal
expenses , but
with pensions
and the
salaries of various
officers.
This
system
continued
in succeeding reigns (t) , the civil list
being
derived
from the hereditary
revenues
and part of
the excise , and being burdened with many of the expenses
of the state.
Queen Anne (u) and George I. (x) not only
spent the whole of this civil list , but contracted consider-
able
debts , which
had to be defrayed by the
country .
On the accession of George II. , it was arranged
that he
should
receive
the hereditary
revenues
, parliament
under-
taking to make up the amount to 800,000l . per annum
if such revenues
fell short of that
sum , while
he should
be entitled
to any surplus (y).
When George III. came
to the throne , he agreed
to surrender the hereditary reve-
nues in
exchange
for
800,000l . (z) ,
which
was settled
upon him .
This sum was increased several times in the
course of his reign , yet numerous debts
were incurred ( a) .

THE
ROYAL REVENUE .
On the accession of George IV. , the hereditary revenues
of the crown were (b) placed at the disposal of the house
of commons , and carried to the consolidated
fund for his
life, and by the same statute
a revenue of 850,000 %. in
England, and
207,000l . in
Ireland
was granted
to his
majesty for life.
On the
accession of William IV. , the
royal revenues were again
surrendered
to the nation (c),
and the clear yearly sum of 510,000l . was directed to be
paid out of the consolidated
fund
for the support of the
royal household and the honour and dignity of the crown .
In the next
session , an act (d) was passed to relieve the
civil list from many
charges which had only a theoretical
connection
with
the
royal
dignity and person , viz . the
salaries of the judges and diplomatic salaries and pensions ,
all of which , together with the allowances to the numerous
members of the royal
family, as also the secret service
money , are now charged by parliament
upon the conso-
lidated fund .
On the accession
of her present majesty , it
was provided (e) that the hereditary revenues of the crown
should , as before, be carried over to the consolidated fund
during the life of her majesty ; and that the consolidated
fund
should
be charged with the
payment of the yearly
sum of 385,000l . for the support of her majesty's house-
hold , and the honour and dignity of the crown ;
(60,000l .
of this amount
being appropriated to her privy purse ;) it
was
also enacted (f) , that whenever the total charge on
the
civil
list
should
in
any
year
exceed
the
sum of
400,000 %. , the particulars
and cause of such excess should
be laid before parliament .
The arrangement
heretofore explained by which
a civil
list is granted
to the sovereign ,
has proved eminently
beneficial .
Hereby
the
revenues
themselves , being put
under
the
same
care
and
management
as the
other
branches of the public
patrimony , produce more and are

better collected than they had been ; and the public is thus
a gainer .
And upon the whole it is doubtless much better
for the crown , and also for the people , to have the revenue
settled
upon the modern
rather
than
upon the
ancient
footing.
For
the
crown ,
because
it is
more
certain ,
and collected with greater
ease ;
for the people , because
they are now
delivered from feudal
hardships
and other
odious
branches
of the prerogative .
Lastly , though it
may not be probable
that a future
sovereign will elect to
take
the
hereditary
revenues
instead of a civil list , the
maintenance of those revenues
forms a substantial security
for the granting of a civil list , and if any complaint
should
hereafter be made as to the amount of the latter , the fact
that the public will receive in exchange for it the income
from the hereditary revenues would furnish a minister of
the crown with a sound and intelligible answer to such a
complaint .

king Henry IV. to the

duchy of Lancaster
as
an inheritance
separate from the crown , and the revenue from the duchy
is now received by her majesty , not having
been

:-:-
Edmund
Plantagenet , a younger
son of king Heury III.,
was created
the first earl of Lancaster
by char-
ter , dated June 30, 1267, and the
honor , county ,

and

Henry, third
earl of Lancaster ,
by a reversal
of the forfeiture

Thomas ,
was
restored
thereto .
He
had

to parliament
as baron
of

Feb.

1299,
and
died
on
Sept. 22, 1345, being
suc-
ceeded by his
son Henry,
fourth
earl of Lancaster ,who , in considera-
tion of his distinguished
services as
a soldier , was, on March
6th , 1351,
created duke of Lancaster by a royal
charter
granted with the
assent of
parliament .
By
another
charter
of the
same
date,
the
court
of
chancery
in the
county
of Lan-
caster,
and all
liberties
and jura
regalia ,
appertaining
to
a county
palatine , were granted
to the duke
for his life.
Henry, first
duke
of Lancaster ,
died , without
male
issue ,
March
24, 1361, and the
dukedom
there-
by
became
extinct .
But
the
barony
of Lancaster ,
created
in
1299, which
was
a barony in fee,
came into abeyance
between
the
two
daughters
(Blanche
and
Ma-
tilda) of Henry,
the
first
duke .
The
Lady
Blanche
Plantagenet
became
eventually , upon the death
of her
sister Matilda in
1362, the
sole heir to her
father .
She mar-
ried John
of Gaunt , earl
of Rich-
mond , fourth son of king Edward
III.,
who , in
right
of his
wife ,
succeeded to the estates of the late
duke , and
who
on May
12, 1362,
was
created
duke
of
Lancaster .
By
charter , dated
Feb.
28,
1377,
the county of Lancaster
was
again
erected into a Palatinate , but only
for the life of the
then
duke .
In
1390,
however , the
grant of the
Palatinate
was
extended
to
the
heirs male of his body .
John , second duke of Lancaster ,
died
Feb.
3,
1399, leaving
Henry
Bolingbroke
(who in 1397 had been
created duke of Hereford ), his only
son and heir.
Henry Bolingbroke
, third
duke
of
Lancaster ,
afterwards
became
king
Henry IV .
By a charter
sanctioned
by par-
liament , and
dated
Oct.
14, 1399,
the king granted
and decreed , that
the duchy of Lancaster
should
re-
main to him, and his heirs for ever,
and be managed as if the king had
never assumed the royal dignity .
By an
act
passed on
Nov.
10,
1 Henry 4, it was enacted that the
king's
eldest
son ,
Henry , should
bear the title of duke
of Lancaster ,
and that the
liberties
and
fran-
chises,
granted
to
the
earls
and
dukes of Lancaster , should
remain
with the king's eldest
son and his
heirs , dukes of Lancaster ,wholly and
entirely
dissevered from the crown .
The
duchy
of
Lancaster
de-
scended
successively
to
Henry V.
and Henry VI.,
upon
whose
at-
tainder
1 Edw. 4, the duchy
was
forfeited
to the
crown , but
an act
was passed to vest the duchy in the
king
and his heirs
kings
of Eng-
land, for
ever,
under
a
separate
management
from the other estates
of the crown , and in the 1 Henry 7,
an act was
passed to
resume such

These estates
are managed under
the direction of the

By the

sovereign
is
restrained
from
alienating
lands , parcel of the
possessions
of the

leases
of land , parcel of the duchy of Lancaster , for building
purposes for terms
not exceeding
ninety -nine years, and
by
various
statutes
the
chancellor
and
council of the
duchy have been authorized to sell land in order to raise
funds for the redemption of the land tax or other property
belonging

X. And here, to prevent
misapprehension
and
render
more complete the view presented in this
chapter of the
royal income , may be noticed the possessions
and revenues
of the duchy of Cornwall , which
have never been surren-
dered to the public . They now consist ,-of the undisposed
of portion of those granted by king
Edward III. to the
Black
Prince ,
upon , or after , his
creation
as
duke
of
Cornwall ; of those annexed to the duchy by subsequent
sovereigns , and not since alienated ; of lands and revenues
acquired by purchase and exchange , and of an annuity (n) ,
charged upon the consolidated fund , under the stat.
1 & 2
Vict .
c.
120 , in
lieu of certain
tin coinage
duties , and
other rights .
The ancient possessions
of the duchy comprise minerals
in the " conventionary tenements " (o) in various
manors
in Cornwall , called the " assessionable manors ," the right
to which minerals
is defined
and
regulated , under
the
provisions of the
stats . 7 & 8 Vict . c. 105
and
11 & 12
Vict . c. 83 , and also minerals in various manors , formerly
parcel of the duchy , which
have been sold , subject to a
reservation of minerals (p).
(m) The
gross
income
of the
duchy
of
Lancaster
in
the
year
1867
amounted
to
upwards
of
40,0007., including
30,1017. from
rents
and
profits
of courts , 77277.
from

under other
places
(below high water mark ) , even
below
low water mark , being in and part of the county of Corn-
wall , are, as between her majesty , and his royal highness
the prince of Wales and duke of Cornwall , declared to be
vested in his
royal
highness , as part
of the territorial
possessions of the duchy ;
and by

mines
and

adjacent to , but not being part of, the county of Cornwall ,
are , as between her majesty and the prince , declared to be
vested in her
majesty , as part of the soil and territorial
possessions of the crown (r).
The estates
and
revenues
( s) of the duchy of Cornwall
are managed by the prince of Wales and duke of Cornwall ,
with the advice of his council , the members of which
are
appointed by letters patent under the prince's
seal .
By the Duchy of Cornwall
Management
Act , 1863
(26
& 27 Vict. c. 49), the duke of Cornwall , or the personage
for the time being
entitled to the revenues of the duchy ,
is now empowered (subject in certain cases to the approval
of the board of treasury ) to sell any part of the possessions
of the duchy , to purchase other lands , to
settle disputed
claims , to refer disputes
to arbitration , to grant
leases ,

Prince's Case, 8 Rep . 1.
(s) The net income
of the duchy
in the year 1838 (the year after the
accession
of her
majesty
to the
throne , ) was 11,5367. ; in 1861, the
net
income
of
the
duchy

to
the
use of his
royal highness
the prince of Wales
and duke of Cornwall , amounted
to

THE
ROYAL
REVENUE
.
The general
tendency of
in the con-
stitution
since Car. 1.
has been
against pre-
rogative.
and to exercise
other powers in relation
to the manage-
ment of the estates of the duchy .
By the 23 & 24 Vict.
c. 53 , the
provisions
of the
9
Geo .
3 , c. 16
(commonly
known
as the Nullum Tempus
Act) were made applicable to the duchy of Cornwall
, and
by the 24 & 25 Vict . c. 62 , those provisions
were extended .
This finishes our inquiries
into
the fiscal
prerogatives
the
changes
of
the crown
;
or
the royal
revenue
,
both
ordinary
and
extraordinary
.
We have now chalked
out all the prin-
cipal
outlines
of
this
vast title
of
the law
,
the supreme
executive magistrate
,
considered
in
his several capacities
and points of view
.
But
,
before we entirely
dismiss this
subject
,
it
may not
be
improper
to
take
a
short compara-
tive
review
of
the
power
,
or
prerogative
of
the crown
,
as
it
stood
in
former days
,
and
as
it
stands
at
present
.
And
we cannot but observe
,
that most of the laws for ascer-
taining
,
limiting
,
and
restraining
this
prerogative
have
been
made within the compass
of
little
more
than
a
century
;
from
the petition
of
right
in
3
Car
.
I.
to
the
accession
of
George III
.
So that the powers
of
the crown
are now
to
all appearance greatly curtailed and diminished
since the
reign
of
king James
I.:
particularly by the
abolition of the star
-
chamber and high commission courts
in
the
reign
of
Charles
I.
,
and by the
disclaiming
of
martial law and the power
of
levying taxes on the subject
by the same prince
:
by the disuse
of
forest laws
;
and by
the
many
excellent
provisions
enacted
in
the
time
of
Charles
II.;
especially the
abolition
of
military tenures
,
purveyance
,
and
pre
-
emption
;
the
habeas
corpus
act
;
and the act
to
prevent the discontinuance
of
parliaments
for above
three years
;
and
,
since the Revolution
,
by the
strong
and
emphatic
words
in
which
our
liberties
are
asserted
in
the bill
of
rights
,
and act
of
settlement
;
by
the
act for triennial
,
since turned
into
septennial
,
elec-
tions
;
by the exclusion
of
certain officials from the house
of
commons
;
by rendering
the seats
of
the judges

manent , and their
salaries liberal
and independent ; and
by restraining
the royal
pardon from obstructing
parlia-
mentary impeachments .
Besides all this , if we consider
how the crown is impoverished and stripped of
its
ancient
revenues
,
so
that
it
must
greatly rely on the liberality
of
parliament
for
its
necessary
support and maintenance
,
we
might perhaps
at
first
be
led
to
think
,
that the balance
is
sufficiently
inclined
to
the
popular
scale
,
and that the
executive magistrate
has not power enough
left
to
check
the united will of the lords and commons
.
But
,
on the
other
hand
,
it
is
to
be
considered
,
that
every sovereign
in
the first
parliament
after his accession
,
has by long
usage
a
truly royal
revenue settled upon him
for his life
;
and should
never have occasion
to
apply
to
parliament
for supplies
,
but upon some public
necessity
of the whole
realm
.
This
restores to the
crown all the
constitutional
independence
which
it
can legitimately
need
,
and frees the sovereign from
being liable
to
coer-
cion by
a
threat
of
reducing
or
withdrawing
his
annual
allowance
.
In addition
to
constitutional
checks on the royal prero-
gative
,
the latest
of
which were imposed upwards
of
a
cen-
tury ago
,
we must remember that
the personal
authority
of the crown has been
considerably diminished within the
last fifty years
,
not by
express
enactments
,
but by the
natural
course
of
events
.
The
sovereign
,
indeed
,
has
now
,
as
formerly
,
the power of appointing
his own min-
isters
,
but
as
these cannot
hold
office
in
the
face
of
a
hostile
majority
of
the
legislature
,
the royal
choice
is
practically
limited
to
the man who
for the
time
being
can command
the votes of the house of commons
.
This
has led
to
the practice
of
the monarch not appointing all
the ministers
of
state
himself
,
but
merely
selecting
one
who
possesses
the
above qualification
.
This
one
(
popu-
larly called the premier
)
is
usually appointed first lord
of
the treasury
,
and allowed
to
select his
own colleagues
,

crown
appointing
the
objects
of
his
choice

offices
for which
they
have
been
thus designated .
The
ministry , once
appointed , hold office during the will of
the lower house, and though
the royal pleasure may turn
the balance when the scales of party are nearly even , and
may occasionally
influence
some appointment , yet prac-
tically England is governed
by the premier and his
col-
leagues , supported by a majority of the legislative body .
Let it not be inferred from anything
above
propounded
that it can to any loyal subject be a matter of indifference
what individual occupies
the throne .
The personal influ-
ence
of the reigning
monarch ,
which
now principally
depends on private
character , is
very great , it operates
both socially and politically ; and the respect with which
the conduct of our present most
gracious
sovereign
has
inspired
her attached people , is perhaps the strongest , as
it
is decidedly the
most glorious
bulwark of the British
throne .
CHAPTER IX.
SUBORDINATE
MAGISTRATES .
IN a former chapter of these Commentaries (a) we dis-
tinguished
magistrates into two kinds
; supreme, or those
in whom the sovereign
power of the state resides ; and
subordinate , or those who act in
an inferior
secondary
sphere .
We
have hitherto
considered the
former
kind
only ; namely , the supreme legislative
power , or parlia-
ment ;
and
the
supreme
executive
power ,
which
is
the sovereign ;
and are now to proceed
to inquire
into
the rights
and duties of the principal
subordinate
ma-
gistrates .
And
herein we are not
to
investigate the powers and
duties of the great
officers of state, the principal
secre-
taries , or the like ; because
they do not appear to
be in
that capacity in any considerable
degree
the object of our
laws , nor have they any very important
share of magiste-
rial power conferred upon them ;
except that
the
secre-
taries of state
have in
some
instances been
allowed the
power
of
commitment
in
order
to
bring
offenders
to
trial (6).
Neither
shall I here treat of the
office
and
authority of the lord chancellor , or the other judges of the
superior courts
of justice
;
because
they will find a more
proper place in the third volume
of these Commentaries .
Nor
shall I
enter into
any minute
disquisitions ,

and
dignities
of mayors
and alder-
men,
or
other
magistrates
of
particular
corporations
;
because
these
are mere private
and
strictly
municipal
rights , depending
entirely upon the domestic constitution
of their respective franchises .
But the
magistrates
and
officers, whose rights
and duties it will be proper in this
chapter to consider , are such as have a jurisdiction and
authority
dispersedly
throughout
the
kingdom
;
who
are principally sheriffs ,
coroners , justices
of the
peace ,
constables,
surveyors of highways , and
overseers
of the
poor ; in treating of whom I shall inquire into , first , their
antiquity
and origin ; next , the manner in which they are
appointed and may be removed ;
and lastly , their
rights
and duties .

The sheriff

antiquity
in this
and origin
kingdom, his name being
derived from two Saxon words ,
reipe

reeve , bailiff, or officer of the
shire .
is
called
in Latin
vice-comes,
as
being
the
deputy
of
the earl or comes, to whom the custody of the shire is said
to have been committed at the first division of this king-
dom into counties .
But the earls in process of time , by
reason of their high employments , and attendance on the
king's person , not being able to transact the business of
the county , were delivered of that burden (c) , reserving to
themselves the honour , whilst the labour was laid on the
sheriff .
So
that
now the
sheriff
does
all the
queen's
business in the county ;
and
though
he be still
called
vice -comes, yet he is entirely independent of, and not sub-
ject to, any local authority
;
the crown , by letters patent ,
having long committed custodiam
comitatus
to the sheriff ,
and him alone , and the appointment of the sheriff (which ,
since the 3 & 4 Will . 4 , c. 99 , has been by warrant in the
form set forth in the schedule
to that
act, made out and
signed by the clerk of the privy council , instead of by letters

made to

This office was
so
honorable
in
ancient times that we
hear of its being
filled by barons , earls , dukes and
even
the
sons of
kings ,
among
whom
may be
mentioned

I. ) ,
who was sheriff of Rutland

chosen

In confirmation
of which it was or- ment.
dained by statute 28 Edw .
1 , c. 8 , that the people should
have the election of sheriffs in every shire , where the shrie-
valty is not of inheritance .
For anciently in some coun-
ties the office of sheriff
was
hereditary ,
as
it continued
to be in the
county of Westmoreland
, till the
13
& 14
Vict .
c.
30.
The citizens of London have also the inhe-
ritance
of the shrievalty
of Middlesex
vested in their
body by charter of king John (ƒ) , the
reason
of these
popular
elections
being
assigned in the
28
Edw .
1 ,
c.
13 , that the
commons might choose
such as would
not
be a burden
to them .
And
herein
appears
plainly
a
trace
of the
democratical
part
of our
constitution , in
which
form of government it is an indispensable
requi-
site, that the
people
should
choose
their
own
magis-
trates (g).
This
election
was in
all
probability
not
absolutely
vested
in the commons , but required the royal
approbation .
For in the
Gothic constitution , the judges
of the county courts (which
office
is still for some pur-
poses
executed by
our sheriff ( ) ) were
elected
by the
people, though
confirmed
by the king , and the
form of
their election was thus managed :
the
people,
or
incolæ
territorii,
chose
twelve
electors ,
and
they
nominated
three persons , ex quibus rex unum confirmabat ().
But
with us in England
these
popular
elections ,

c. 7, 23 Hen. 6 , c. 7, and 21 Hen . 8, c. 20, the chancellor ,

of the rolls , the justices of the one bench and the
other, barons of the exchequer , and all others who might
be called to ordain , name, or make justices of the peace ,
sheriffs , and other officers of the king , should
be sworn
to act indifferently , and to appoint
no man

sueth
either
privily

openly to be

only
as

And the custom now is (and has been at least
ever since the time of Fortescue (k) , who was chief justice
and chancellor
to Henry VI.) , that the judges , together
with the other great
officers
and privy councillors , meet
in the exchequer on the morrow of St. Martin (1) , yearly
and then and there the judges propose three persons , to be
reported
(if approved of ) to the
queen , who afterwards
appoints
one of them to be sheriff ; and it has been de-

appointment
is

•
This custom of the twelve (n) judges
proposing
three
persons , seems
similar
to the
Gothic constitution
before
mentioned
; with this
difference , that among the
Goths
the twelve
nominators
were first
elected
by the
people
themselves .
And this
usage of ours , at its first
intro-
duction , was perhaps founded upon some statute , not now
to be found among
our
printed
laws ; first , because
it is
materially
different from the direction
of all the
statutes
before mentioned , which it is hard
to
conceive
that
the
judges
would
have countenanced by their concurrence , or
that Fortescue
would
have inserted in his
book , unless
by the authority of some statute ;
and
also
because
a
statute
is expressly referred
to in the
record , which
sir
Edward
Coke tells us (o) he transcribed from the council-
book of 3 March , 34 Hen. VI. , and which is in substance
as follows .
The king had of his own authority
appointed
a man sheriff of Lincolnshire
, which
office he refused to
take upon him ;
whereupon the
opinions
of the judges
were taken , what should be done in this behalf .
And the
two chiefjustices , sir John Fortescue and sir John Pricot ,
delivered the unanimous
opinion of them all , " that the
king did an error when he made a person sheriff , that was
not chosen and presented to him according to the statute ;
that the person
refusing was liable to no fine for disobe-
dience , as if he had been one of the three persons chosen
according to the tenor of the
statute , that they
would
advise the king to have recourse to the three persons
that
were chosen according to the
statute, or that some other
rates to exempt
thenceforth
from
liability to serve , unless
the
per-
son paying
it, afterwards
becomes

thrifty man be entreated to occupy the office for this year ;
and
that , the
next year , to eschew such inconveniences ,
the order of the statute in this behalf
made be observed ."
But
notwithstanding
this
unanimous
resolution
of the
judges of England , thus entered
in the
council -book , and
the statute
34 & 35
Hen . 8, c. 26 , s. 61 , which expressly
recognises this to be the law of the land , some of our
writers (p) have affirmed that
the
crown , by
its
preroga-
tive
,
may
name whom
it
pleases
to
be sheriff
,
whether
chosen by the judges
or
no
.
This
is
grounded on
a
very
particular
case
in
the fifth year
of
queen Elizabeth
,
when
,
by reason
of
the plague
,
Michaelmas
term was not kept
at
Westminster
,
so
that the judges
could not meet there
to
nominate the sheriffs
,
whereupon
the queen named them
herself
,
without such previous
assembly
,
appointing
for
the most part one
of
the two remaining
on the last year's
list
(q).
And this
case
,
thus
circumstanced
,
is
the
only
authority
in
our books for the making of these extraor-
dinary sheriffs
.
It
was
indeed
held
,
the reporter
adds
,
that the queen by her prerogative might make
a
sheriff
without
the
election
of
the judges
,
non
obstante
aliquo
statuto in contrarium
;
but the
doctrine
of
non
obstante
,
which
sets the prerogative
above the laws
,
was effectually
demolished by the bill of rights
at
the
Revolution
,
and
abdicated Westminster
hall when king James
abdicated
the kingdom
.
However
,
it
must
be acknowledged
,
that
the practice
of
occasionally naming what are called pocket-
sheriffs
,
by the
sole authority
of
the crown
,
continued
to
the reign
of
George III
.,
since which
time few

The sheriff , by virtue
of several old statutes , is to con-
tinue in office no longer than
one
year ;
and yet it has
been said (s) that a sheriff may be appointed durante bene
placito, and so is the form of the royal writ (t) , and of the
present warrant of appointment
superseding that writ (u) .
Therefore, till a new sheriff
be named , his
office
cannot
be determined , unless by his
own death , or the demise
of
the crown (x) , in which last case it was usual for the suc-
cessor to send a new writ to the
old
sheriff ; but now
by statute
1 Ann . st . 1 , c . 8 , all officers appointed by the
preceding
sovereign may hold their offices
for six months
after the demise of the crown , unless
sooner displaced by
the successor .
We will further observe , that by statute
1
Rich . 2 , c .

the office of sheriff
for one year , can be compelled
to
serve the

within three years after (y) .

the

claimed was not in excess of forty shillings

though
the
statute
9 & 10 Vict .
c .
95 , took
away
the
sheriff's
small
debt jurisdiction in the old
county court ,
yet
sect . 4 of that statute expressly preserved it for other
purposes , and the sheriff has still to hold his court for the
election of knights of the shire , whose return de facto he
decides , as well
as for that of coroner .
In this court also
proceedings
are taken with a view to outlawry .
Writs
of inquiry, under 8 & 9 Will . 3 , c.

As keeper of the queen's

and special commission , the sheriff
is the first man in the
county , and superior to any nobleman therein , during his

He may
apprehend , and commit
to

break the
peace , or attempt
to
break it ; and
may bind any
one in a recognisance
to
keep the peace .
He may , and is bound ex officio
to pur-
sue , and take
all
traitors , murderers , felons , and other
misdoers , and commit them to gaol for safe custody .
He
is also to defend his county against
any of the queen's
enemies when they come into the land : and for this pur-
pose , as well as for keeping the peace and pursuing
felons ,
he may command all the people of his county to attend
him ; which
is called the posse

But though the sheriff
is thus the principal
conservator of the peace in his county ,
yet by the express directions of the great charter (f) , he
is forbidden to hold pleas of the crown , or , in other words ,
to try any criminal offence .

be highly un-
becoming, that the executioner of justice
should
be also
the
judge ;
should
impose ,
as

as

and

one day condemn a man to death ,
and personally

.
Under-she-
riff.
Deputy-
sheriff.
To execute these various
duties , the sheriff
has under
him many
inferior
officers
; an under -sheriff , a deputy-
sheriff , bailiffs , and gaolers ; who must
neither buy , sell ,
nor farm their offices , on forfeiture of 500l . (k).
The under -sheriff , who must
now be nominated by the
sheriff within one month
after
his own
appointment
( 7) ,
usually performs the routine duties of the shrievalty ; some
few duties only , for discharging which the personal presence
of the high sheriff is necessary
, being excepted
.
Formerly
the
under -sheriff
was
precluded
from remaining in office
above
a year (m) , and
from
practising
as
an attorney
during
such period (n), but these regulations , which had
long been successfully
evaded , are
abolished (o) , and the
under -sheriff
is
now almost invariably
an attorney , and
frequently
remains
in office for many consecutive years .
As the sheriff
is responsible
for the
acts of his under-
sheriff , it is usual and proper to take security from him
for the due performance of his
duties (p).
At one time
the office of under-sheriff
was determined by the death of
the sheriff , but the stat . 3 Geo .
1 , c. 15 , provides that in
the event of the death or lawful supercession of the latter
during
his
year of
office , the under - sheriff
(or
deputy-
sheriff ) shall
continue in
office , and
execute
the duties
thereof in the name of the
deceased
sheriff until another
be appointed .
The
deputy -sheriff ,
as
at
present
constituted ,
is
an
officer
formerly
unknown
to
the law ; for though by
various
old statutes the
sheriff
was
ordered to make a
deputy in the courts of common law and
chancery , yet
the practice
was
for him to appoint
his
under -sheriff
deputy , and
the
under -sheriff
appointed
his
agent in
town to act for him.

SHERIFF'S OFFICERS .

s.
20, the
sheriff himself is required
to
appoint
a
de-
puty (q) ,
for
the
receipt
of
writs , granting
warrants
thereon , making
returns
thereto ,
and
accepting
of
all
rules and orders to be made on , or touching the execution
of, any process or writ directed to the sheriff (r).
Bailiffs , or sheriff's
officers , are either bailiffs of hun- Bailiffs.
dreds, or
special bailiffs .
Bailiffs of hundreds , or com-
mon bailiffs , are
officers appointed
over those respective
districts by the sheriff , to collect fines therein , to summon
juries , to attend the judges and justices
at the assizes and
quarter - sessions , and also to execute
writs
and
process
in
the several
hundreds .
And it was once held that these
bailiffs
should
be persons who knew every man's person
and
land within
the hundred ,
so that
they might the
more
easily
execute
process ,
and it
was
provided
by
several
ancient
statutes that
they should
have sufficient
lands
within the county
to answer the king
and his
people in case any should
complain
against them .
The
sheriff
being
generally
answerable
for
the
misdoing of
these bailiffs (s ) , they are usually bound in an obligation.
with sureties for the due execution of their office .
Special
bailiffs
are
officers chosen by the plaintiff in a
suit , or his attorney , and appointed by the sheriff at their
request for the purpose of executing
a particular writ ; and
the sheriff is not usually responsible for their misconduct ,
to those at whose instance he appointed them ( t) , though
he may be so to third persons.

dismiss him at pleasure (u).
It was the gaoler's business
to keep safely all persons
committed
by lawful warrant
to his custody ;
and if he suffered
any to escape , the
sheriff had to answer to the crown , in a criminal , or to the
party injured in a civil
case (x) .
And to this end he was
required
to have
lands
sufficient within
the
county
to
answer the claims of the
sovereign
and his people.
The
absolute authority of the sheriff over the gaoler was , how-
ever , curtailed by various
statutes , and now by the 28 &
29 Vict .
c.
126 , this
latter
officer is
appointed
by the
justices
at sessions, instead of by the sheriff , and holds
office during their
pleasure .
The legal
custody
of all
prisoners
confined in prison
under the above act is vested
in the gaoler , not in the sheriff , except
as
regards pri-
soners
under
sentence
of death , over whom , for the pur-
pose of carrying
the sentence into effect, the sheriff
has
the same jurisdiction
as he
possessed
before the statute .
The only
prisoners for whose
escape
the sheriff
is
now
liable , are debtors , and for their
safe custody the gaoler is
bound to give him security .
The
vast
expense ,
which
custom
had
introduced
in
serving the office of high sheriff , had become
so burthen-
some to the subject , that it was enacted , by statute 13 &
14 Car . 2 , c. 21 , that no sheriff (except of London , West-
moreland , and towns which are counties of themselves )
should
keep
any table at the
assizes , except for his own
family , or give any presents to the judges
or their
ser-
vants , or have more than forty men in
livery
: yet , for
the
sake of safety and
decency , he might not have less
than twenty men in England and twelve in Wales ; upon
forfeiture , in any of these cases , of 2007.
The expenses
attendant
on the
shrievalty
have been still
further
di-
minished by 22 & 23 Vict . c. 32 , s . 18 , enacting that the

He is called II . Coroner.
coroner , coronator, because
he has principally to do with and origin
pleas of the crown , or such wherein
the sovereign is more
immediately
concerned (y).
And in this light
the lord
chief justice of the queen's bench is the principal
coroner
in the kingdom , and may
(if he pleases ) exercise the juris-
diction
of a coroner
in
any part of the realm
(≈), the
puisne judges of that court being also " sovereign coroners
of the land" (a).
But there are also particular
coroners for every county
of England ; usually four , but sometimes six , and some-
times fewer (6).
This officer (c) is of equal antiquity with
the sheriff ; and was ordained
together with him to keep

been

laws, the sheriffs , conservators of the peace , and all other
officers concerned in matters that affected the liberty of the
people were appointed (g) ; and as verderors of the forest
were appointed , whilst that
office existed , their
business
being to stand between the prerogative and the subject in
the execution of the forest laws .
For this purpose there is
a writ at common law de coronatore
eligendo (h) : in which
it is expressly commanded the
sheriff , " quod talem eligi
faciat, qui melius et sciat, et velt, et possit , officio illi in-
tendere ."
And in order to effect this the more surely , it
was enacted by the
statute of Westm . I. (2) that
none
but lawful and discreet knights should
be
chosen
; and
there was an instance in the 15 Edw . III . , of a man being
removed
from this
office because
he was only
a mer-
chant (k).
But it was afterwards held sufficient if a man
had lands enough
to be made a knight , whether he were
really knighted
or not (7) : for the coroner ought to have
an
estate
sufficient to maintain
the dignity of his office ,
and answer any fines that may be set upon him for mis-
behaviour (m) ; and if he has not enough to answer , his
fine shall be levied on the
county , as the punishment
for
electing an insufficient
officer (n).

This does
not apply to the coroner of a borough , who
requires
no qualification , provided
he be a "
fit
person
,'
and neither alderman nor councillor
of
the borough
(0).
Although
in

,
no coroner would

complained of ( p) ; though
since
his
time
those fees have been much enlarged (q) .
The
system of payment by fees , however , being
found
very inconvenient
in counties , was abolished
by the 23
& 24 Vict .
c. 116 , and county
coroners are now paid by
salary , calculated proportionately
to the fees received (r) .
The coroner
is
chosen
for life : but
may be removed ,
either by being
made sheriff , which
is an
office incom-
patible with the other ; or by the writ
de
coronatore
ex-
onerando
, for a cause to be therein
assigned , as that he is
engaged in other
business , is incapacitated by years
or
sickness , has not a sufficient
estate in the county , or lives
in an inconvenient
part of it (s) .
And by the
statute
23
& 24 Vict .
c .
116 , s .
6 , inability or misbehaviour
in
office are also made causes of removal , such removal to be
effected
by the lord chancellor , who
exercises
a general
jurisdiction over
coroners
(t).
The functions of a coroner are like those of the sheriff ,
either judicial
or ministerial
;
but principally judicial .
His
duty is in a great
measure ascertained by statute
4 Edw. I. , De officio
coronatoris : and consists , first , in
inquiring , when any person is slain , or dies suddenly , or
in prison , concerning the manner of his death.
And this
must be " super visum corporis " (u) : for, if the body be
not found , the coroner cannot sit (x).
He was formerly
obliged to sit at the very place where the death happened :
but it is now provided by the 6 & 7 Vict . c. 12 , s . 1 , that , as
it is often unknown
where persons lying dead

by their deaths , the inquest
may be held
by the coroner
within whose jurisdiction the body shall be found ; and his
inquiry is made by a jury from the county , over whom he
is to preside .
This jury must consist of at least
twelve ,
and it is desirable
to have
a larger
number , as , in the
event of their
not
being
unanimous , the
verdict
of
a
majority (not less than
twelve ) is sufficient (y) . If any
be found guilty by this
inquest of murder or other homi-
cide, the coroner is to commit them to prison
for further
trial , and is also to inquire concerning
their lands , goods ,
and chattels , which
are forfeited
thereby : and he should
certify the whole of this
inquisition

own

thereon , to the court of queen's bench , or the next assizes.

origin
The common law has ever had
a
special care and regard
for the conservation
of
the
peace
;
for
peace
is
the very
end
and
foundation
of civil
society
.
And
,
therefore
,
before the present
constitution
of
justices
was invented
,
peculiar
officers were
appointed by the common law for
the maintenance
of
the public
peace
.
Of these
some had
,
and still have
,
the power
of
maintaining
it
annexed
to
offices
which
they
hold
;
others had
it
merely
by itself
,
and were thence named custodes
or
conservatores
pacis
.
The sovereign
(e)
is
,
by her office and dignity royal
,
the principal
conservator
of
the
peace
within her
domi-
nions
;
and may give
authority
to
any other
to
see the
peace
kept
,
and
to
punish
such
as
break
it
:
hence
it
is
usually
called the queen's
peace
.
The
lord
chancellor
or
keeper
,
the
lord
treasurer
,
the lord
high steward
of
England
,
the justices
of
the
court
of
queen's bench
(
by
virtue
of
their
offices
),
and the master
of
the
rolls
(
by
prescription
),
are
general
conservators
of
the
peace
throughout
the kingdom
,
and may commit all breakers
of
it
,
or
bind them
in
recognizances
to
keep
it(ƒ
):
the other
judges
are only
so
in
their own courts
.
The coroner
is
also
a
conservator
of
the peace within his own county
(g
);
as
is
the sheriff
();
and either
of
them may take
a
recog-
nizance
or
security
for the
peace
.
Constables
are
also
conservators
of
the peace within their
own jurisdictions
;
and may apprehend all breakers
of
the peace and commit
them
,
till they find sureties for their keeping
it

SUBORDINATE
MAGISTRATES
.
Those who were, without
any office, simply and merely
conservators
of the
peace , either
claimed
that
power by
prescription (k) ; or were bound to exercise it by the tenure
of their lands ( ) ;
or, lastly, were chosen by the free-
holders in full
county court before the sheriff ; the writ
for their election directing
them to be chosen " de probio-
ribus
et potentioribus
comitatus
sui in custodes pacis ” (m).
But when queen Isabel , the wife of Edward II. , had con-
trived to depose
her husband by a forced resignation
of
the
crown , and
had set up his
son , Edward III . in his
place ;
this,
being
a thing
then
without example
in
England, it was feared would
much
alarm
the
people :
especially
as the
old king
was
living ,
though
hurried
about from
castle to
castle ; till at last he met with an
untimely
death .
To
prevent , therefore ,
any risings , or
other disturbance of the peace , the new king sent writs to
all the sheriffs in England , the form of which is preserved
by Thomas Walsingham (n), giving
a plausible
account
of the manner of his obtaining
the crown ; saying that it
was done ipsius patris bene placito : and commanding
each
sheriff that the peace be kept throughout
his bailiwick , on
pain and peril of disinheritance
and loss of life and limb .
And in
a few weeks after the date of these writs , it was
ordained in parliament
(o) , that , for the better maintain-
ing and keeping of the
peace in every
county , good
men
and lawful , which
were no maintainers of evil , or barre-
tors (p) in the
country , should
be
assigned to keep the
peace .
And in this manner , and upon this occasion , was
the election of the conservators of the peace taken from the
people and given to the crown (q) ; this assignment being
construed to be by the queen's commission (r).

JUSTICES
OF THE

they were called only conservators , wardens , or keepers of
the
peace , till the
statute
34
Edward
3 , c.
1 , gave them
the power of trying
felonies ; and then they acquired the
more honorable appellation
of justices ( s) .
66
These justices
are appointed
by
the
queen's
special
commission
under the great seal, the form of which was
settled by the judges ,
A.D.
1590 (1) , and has been
very
slightly altered since.
This appoints all the justices
named
in it (u ), jointly and separately , to keep the peace , and any
two or more of them to inquire of and determine felonies
and
other misdemeanors : in which number
some
parti-
cular justices , or one of them , were directed
to be always
included ,
and
no
business
to be
done
without
their
presence : the
words of the
commission
running thus ,
quorum aliquem restrum A.
B. C. D.
&c. ,
unum
esse
volumus ;"
whence the persons
so named
were usually
called justices of the quorum.
And formerly it was cus-
tomary to appoint only a select number of justices , eminent
for their
skill and discretion , to be of the quorum ; but
now the practice is to advance
all of them to that dignity ,
naming
them
over again in the
quorum
clause , and no
exception is now allowable for not expressing in the form
of warrants , &c. , that the justice
who issued them is of
the
quorum (x).
When any justice
intends
to act under
this commission , he sues out a writ of dedimus
potestatem ,
from
the clerk
of the
crown
in
chancery,
empowering
certain
persons
therein
named
to
administer
the usual
oaths to him (y) .
This being done , he is at liberty to act.

Touching
the number
and qualifications
of justices
; it
was ordained by 18 Edw . 3 , st . 2 , c. 2 , that two or three
of the best reputation
in
each county , should be assigned
to be keepers of the peace .
But these being found rather
too few for that purpose , it was provided
by
statute
34
Edw . 3 , c.
1 , that one lord , and three , or four of the most
worthy men in the county, with some learned in the law,
should be made justices in every county .
Afterwards
the
number of justices , through
the ambition of private
per-
sons , became
so large , that it was thought
necessary by
stats. 12 Ric .
2 ,
c.
10 , and
14 Ric.
2 , c.
11 , to restrain
them ,
at
first
to
six,
and
afterwards
to
eight
only .
This
rule ,
however , is now
disregarded , and
the
cause
seems to be (as Lambard
observed
long ago (z ) ) , that the
astonishing
increase of statutory provisions , the execution
of which is entrusted to justices of the peace , has necessi-
tated their
increase to a larger number .
As
to their
qualifications , the statutes just cited direct them to be of
the best reputation , and most worthy men in the county :
and the
13 Ric . 2 , st.
1 , c.
7, orders them to be of the
most
sufficient
knights , esquires, and gentlemen
of the
law.
Also by statute 2 Hen . 5, st .
1 , c. 4 , and st. 2 , c . 1 ,
they must be resident
in their several counties ; though
now by 11 & 12 Vict . c. 42, ss. 5 , 6 , 7 , and 11 & 12 Vict.
c. 43 , s. 6 , amended
by 26 & 27 Vict . c. 77 , it is provided
that
justices
of two
adjoining
counties ,
or
ridings , or
divisions of counties , resident in one of them , may act in
the other , and also that such justices
may act in detached
parts of counties , or in cities , towns , and precincts having
a separate jurisdiction
.
Further , because , contrary
to the earlier
statutes , men
of small substance had crept into the
commission , whose
poverty
made them
both
covetous
and contemptible , it
was
enacted
by statute 18 Hen. 6 , c.
11 , that
no justice
oath
is in substitution
of the for-
mer
official
oath ,
or whether
a
declaration
to
the
effect of that
oath must be taken ?

should
be put in commission if he had not lands to the
value of 20%. per annum .
And the rate of money having
greatly altered since that time , it has since been enacted
by statutes
5 Geo. 2 , c .
18 , and
18 Geo .
2 ,
c. 20 , that
every justice , except as is therein excepted
, shall have 100 %.
per annum
clear of all deductions , derived from
landed
property in possession ; or else shall be entitled
to the
immediate reversion of the same class of property of the
yearly
value of 300 %. , and if a person
assumes to act as
justice without this
qualification , he
becomes
liable
to a
penalty of 100 %. ( a) .
Also it is provided by the 5 Geo. 2 ,
c. 18 , s . 2 , that no practising
proctor , and by 6 & 7 Vict .
c. 73 , s. 33, that no practising
attorney or solicitor , shall
be capable of acting as a justice of the peace ; but each of
these acts contains a proviso that the prohibition
shall not
extend to any city or town
being a county of itself, or to
any city , town , cinque port , or liberty , having
justices of
the peace within their
respective limits and precincts , by
charter , commission , or otherwise .
The office of justice of the peace subsists only
during
the pleasure of the crown , and is determinable :
1. By the
demise of the
crown ; or rather , in six months
after (b).
Though if the
same
justice is put in commission by the
successor
, he shall not be obliged to sue out a new dedimus ,
or make the declaration
as to his qualification
afresh (c) :
nor, by reason of any new commission , to take the oaths.

4. By a new
commission , which
virtually , though silently , discharges all the former justices
that are not included therein ; for two commissions cannot
subsist at once .
5. By accession to the office of sheriff (ƒ),
which disqualifies during the period of the shrievalty , but
no longer .
Formerly it was thought , that if a man named
in any
commission of the
peace , had
afterwards
a new
dignity conferred upon him, his office was determined ; he
no longer
answering
his
description
in the commission :
but it was provided , that notwithstanding
a new title of
dignity, the justice on whom it was conferred should still
continue a justice (g).
The
power , office , and duty
of a justice of the
peace
depend
on his
commission , and on the
statutes
which
have created
his jurisdiction .
His commission empowers
him singly to conserve the peace
; and thereby gives
him
the power of the ancient conservators at the common law,
in suppressing
riots
and affrays , in taking securities
for
the peace , and in apprehending and committing
criminals .
It also
empowers any two or more justices
to hear and
determine felonies and other offences ; which is the ground
of their jurisdiction , much curtailed by statute (h ) , at the
general sessions.
Many
other
duties
have
been
cast on justices of the
peace
by parliament
;
so complicated , indeed , have these
duties become , that to prevent the possibility of a justice
being harassed by action for having unwittingly exceeded
the letter of the law, statutory provisions
have from time
to time been made to protect him in the upright
discharge

of his office () ; which , among other privileges , prohibit
a justice from being sued for any oversight , without
notice
beforehand ; and stop any suit begun , on tender made of
sufficient
amends .
The
principal
statute now in force for
this purpose is the
11 & 12 Vict . c. 44, which , inter alia,
provides that no action
shall be brought against a magis-
trate for anything
done within his jurisdiction
, unless it
be alleged and proved to have been done
maliciously
and
without reasonable and probable
cause (k) , nor for any
thing done under
a conviction
or order , unless it
shall
have been quashed ( 1) ; that
an
action
shall be brought
against the justice
who makes
a conviction
or order, and
not against
the justice
who grants
a warrant upon it, if
these acts
be done by different justices (m) ; that no justice
shall be liable for granting
a warrant of distress to enforce
a poor rate which turns out to be invalid , or for the man-
ner in which he exercises
any discretionary power entrusted
to him (n ) . If a justice
refuse to do any act for
fear of
having an action brought
against him, whoever wishes it
done may apply
to the queen's bench for a rule ordering
the justice
to do it , and
he , acting
under such rule , will
be
free from
liability (o).
Lastly ,
no action
shall
be
brought
against
a justice
for
anything
done by him
in the execution
of his
office ,
more than six months.
after the act complained of, or without a month's notice (p) .
On the other hand , any malicious
or tyrannical
abuse of
his
office by
a justice
of the
peace
is
usually
severely
punished : and any person recovering a verdict
against
a
justice , for a wilful or malicious injury , is entitled
to full
costs to be taxed as between attorney and client .

before been noticed , but still
performing
useful
duties
throughout
the kingdom .
The word constable is by some
derived from the Saxon
koning -rapel , and said to signify " the stay (or hold ) of the
king " (q).
But as we borrowed
the name as well as the
office of constable from the French, it
seems
safer to
deduce it , with sir Henry Spelman (r) and Dr. Cowell (s) ,
from their language
: wherein it is plainly derived
from
the Latin
comes stabuli (t) , an
officer well known in the
empire ;
so
called
because , like the
great
constable
of
France , as well as the lord high constable of England , he
was to regulate all matters of chivalry , tilts , tournaments ,
and
feats
of arms , which were performed
on horseback .
This office of lord high
constable
has been disused
in
England, except
only upon great and solemn occasions , as
a coronation and the like, ever since the attainder of Staf-
ford duke of Buckingham
under king Henry VIII.;
as in
France it was suppressed about a century after by an edict
of Louis XIII . (u ) : but from his office , says Lambard (x) ,
this lower
constableship was at first drawn
and fetched ,
and is
as it were a very finger of that hand .
For the
statute of Winchester
(y ) directed
that ,
for
the
better
keeping of the peace , two constables
in every hundred
and
franchise
should
inspect all matters relating
to arms and
armour .
Constables were formerly of two sorts , high constables ,
and petty constables .
The
former
are thought by some
to have been first appointed
by the statute of Winches-
ter (x ) , (13
Edw.
1 , st.
2 , c.
6 , ) and the
latter in the
reign of Edward III. (a) , while others , on better grounds ,
consider constables to be officers known to our common law,

CONSTABLES .

though additional
duties were cast on them by the above-
mentioned
statutes (b),
and it is certain
that
they are
referred to by name, as officers already existing , in the
statute of Westminster
1st (c).
High constables are appointed at the court leets of the
franchise
or hundred
over which
they preside , or, in de-
fault of that, by the justices
at their special
sessions
(d);
and
are
removable by the
same authority
that appoints
them (e).
Petty constables are inferior
officers
in every
town and parish subordinate
to the high constable of the
hundred .
These petty constables had two
offices
united
in them : the one ancient , the other modern .
Their ancient
office was that of head-borough , tithing-man , or bors-
holder ; of whom
we formerly
spoke (ƒ) , and who are as
ancient as the time of the
Saxons ; their more modern
office was that of constable merely , in order to assist the
high constable (g) .
And in general , the
ancient
head-
boroughs , tithing-men , and borsholders , were made use of
to serve
as petty constables ; though not so generally , but
that in many places they still
continued
distinct
officers
from the constable .
They were formerly
chosen by the
jury at the court leet ;
or if no court leet were held , were
appointed
by two
justices
of the
peace (h) ;
but petty
constables
are now appointed by the justices
in special
petty sessions , and the act (i) directing
such appointment
expressly
provides
that
no head-borough ,
&c. , shall
be
appointed at any court leet , except for the performance of
duties unconnected with the preservation of the peace .
Petty constables , though still existing in many parts of
the kingdom , have been to a great extent
superseded
by
the county constabulary , which by several acts (j) are now

superintendents , inspectors , and sergeants under him, for
the county or a district therein , and the chief constable ,
with the concurrence of two or more justices , may appoint
any number of petty constables to act under him .
Again ,
all boroughs falling within the provisions of the municipal
corporation
acts
are expressly empowered to appoint their
own
constables (k),
such
power of
appointment
being
vested in a watch
committee consisting of the mayor and
a certain chosen number of the members of the council of
the
borough .
The borough
police
may , in any case , be
consolidated
with the
county
constabulary
in the
ad-
joining
county , if the county justices
and the council of
the borough
agree
to do so (? ) ; but though this agreement
is voluntary in the first
instance , yet when
once
entered
into , it cannot be put an end to without
the sanction of a
secretary of state (m) .
None of these arrangements apply
to the city of London , or to the metropolitan
police dis-
trict, each of which has a police jurisdiction of its own .
One
material
difference
exists
between the original
petty , often called parish , constables , and those appointed
under
various
statutes
for
counties ,
boroughs ,
or
the
metropolis , viz . ,
that the
latter
receive
pay ,
and
may
resign
on giving due notice
when
they choose , whereas
the former are entitled
to no remuneration , and are liable
to a penalty if they refuse to serve or find a substitute (n) ,
unless they come within the class of exempted
persons (o).
In order to preserve the
peace , when there is reason to
believe that its
ordinary guardians
are or may be insuffi-
cient for the purpose , it is provided by statute that when-
ever it shall be made to appear to two or more justices (p) ,

on the oath of a credible witness , that there is reason to
apprehend
some
felony ,
tumult , or riot, and
that
the
ordinary
officers
are insufficient
to repress it, then they
may appoint any number
of persons, not legally exempt ,
to be sworn in and serve as special constables .
Persons
so appointed
are bound to act, and till their services
are
dispensed
with by the justices
of the
county
or place
within which
they
have been called
out , they have the
authority
and privileges of other constables (9 ) .
The general duty of constables , high and petty , as well
as of the other
officers, is to keep the
peace
in their
several
districts
; and
for that
purpose
they
are armed
with large powers , of arresting and imprisoning
, of break-
ing
open
houses ,
and the like ;
nor
can
an
action be
brought
against
a constable for anything
done in the exe-
cution
of his duty , unless brought
within
six
calendar
months from the time of the act complained
of (r) : he is
also protected from legal proceedings for anything
done
in
pursuance of a justice's
warrant , whether the justice.
be liable to an action for excess of jurisdiction or not (s).
One of the constable's
principal
duties , arising
from the
statute of Winchester
, was to keep watch and ward in his
jurisdiction .
Ward guard , or custodia , was chiefly applied
to the day-time , in order to apprehend rioters , and robbers
on the highways ; the manner of doing which was left to
the discretion of the justices
of the
peace
and
the con-
stable (t) :
the
hundred
being
however
answerable
in
respect of robberies committed
therein , by day-light , for
having kept negligent guard .
Watch was properly appli-

was
to be kept in every
borough
and
town , especially in the
summer season, to apprehend all rogues , vagabonds , and
night-walkers , and make them
give an account of them-
selves .
The constable was formerly
allowed
to appoint
watchmen , at his
discretion , regulated by the custom of
the place ; and these , being his deputies , had for the time
being the authority of their principal

it is provided by stat.

rish or other place may under certain circumstances adopt
the provisions of that act for watching

if so , elect inspectors , who may appoint such number of

where there

notice that he is ready to take the charge thereof

From
such burthen
no man was exempt by our ancient laws ,
whatever
other immunities
he might enjoy :
this
being
part of the trinoda necessitas
to which every man's
estate
was subject ; viz. expeditio contra hostem , arcium construc-
tio, et pontium reparatio (y).
For , though
the
reparation
of bridges only is expressed, yet
that of roads
also must.
be understood .
And indeed now, for the most part , the
care of the roads only seems to be left to parishes ; that of
bridges being in great measure devolved upon the county
at large , by statute 22 Hen . 8 , c. 5. If the parish neglected
these repairs , they might formerly ,
as they
may still , be
indicted
for
such their
neglect :
but it
was
not
then
incumbent
on
any
particular
officer to call the parish
together , and set them upon this work ; for which
reason ,
by the statute

c . 8, surveyors of the
highways
were ordered
to be chosen in every parish .
office.
These surveyors were, according to the above
statute of Origin of
the
Philip and Mary
,
to
be
appointed by the
constable and
churchwardens
of
the parish
;
they were afterwards
con-
stituted by two neighbouring
justices

and origin
of the office.
VI. I proceed, lastly, to consider the overseers
of the (VI ) Over-
poor ; their origin, and duties .
The poor of England , till the time of Henry VIII . , sub- Antiquity
sisted entirely upon
private
benevolence
, and the charity
of well-disposed Christians .
For though it appears (2) ,
that by the common law the poor were to be " sustained
by parsons , rectors of the church , and the parishioners , so
that none of them die for default
of sustenance ;" and
though by the statutes 12 Ric. 2, c. 7, and 19 Hen . 7 , c. 12 ,
the poor were directed
to abide in the
cities
or towns
wherein they were born , or such wherein
they had dwelt
for three years (which seems
to be the first rudiment of
parochial settlement ) , yet till the statute 27 Hen . 8 , c. 25,
no compulsory method was chalked out for effecting these
purposes : but the poor seem to
have been left
to such
relief as the humanity
of their neighbours
would
afford
them .
The monasteries
were, in particular , their prin-
cipal
resource ; and among
other bad
effects
which
at-
tended the monastic
institutions
, it was not perhaps one
of the least (though
frequently
esteemed
quite otherwise )
that they
supported
and fed
a very
numerous
and very
idle poor , whose
sustenance
depended
upon
what
was
(p) The 4 &
5 Vict . c.
59, pro-
viding as above , was
a temporary
act, but was renewed
from
time to
time , and by 28 & 29 Vict . c. 119,
was continued
to Dec. 1, 1870, and
the end of the next session of par-
liament . It being doubtful
whether
highway
boards were liable
to con-
tribute to the repair
of the turn-
pike roads , it was enacted by stat .
26 & 27 Vict. c. 94, that they were

daily distributed
in alms at the gates of the
religious
houses.
But ,
upon
the
total
dissolution
of these , the
inconvenience of thus encouraging
the poor in habits of
indolence
and beggary was quickly felt throughout
the
kingdom
and abundance of statutes
were made in the
reign of king Henry VIII . and his children , for providing
for the poor and impotent : who , the preambles
to some
of them recite , had then of late years
greatly increased .
These poor were principally of two sorts ; sick
and impo-
tent , and therefore unable to work ; idle and sturdy , and
therefore able, but not
willing , to
exercise
any
honest
employment .
To provide
in some measure for both of
these, in and about the metropolis , Edward VI. founded
three royal
hospitals
; Christ's
and St. Thomas's , for the
relief of the impotent through
infancy
or
sickness
and
Bridewell for the
punishment
and
employment
of the
vigorous
and idle .
But
these were far from
being suffi-
cient for the care of the poor throughout
the kingdom
at
large
and therefore , after many
other fruitless
experi-
ments , by the statute
43 Eliz . c. 2 , overseers
of the poor
were appointed in every
parish .
:
By virtue of the statute last mentioned , these
overseers
were to be nominated
yearly in Easter
week , or within
one month
after (though
a subsequent
nomination
was
valid (r) ) , by two justices
dwelling
near the parish .
They
were to be , and still must be, substantial
householders ,
and so expressed to be in the appointment
of the jus-
tices (s).
Their office
and duty , according
to the
same
statute ,
were principally
these : first , to raise competent
sums for
the necessary relief of the poor , impotent , old , blind , and
such others being poor, and not able to work ; and secondly ,
to provide
work for
such
as
were able,
and
could
not
otherwise
get employment ; but
this
latter
part of their
duty , which , according to the regulations
of that statute ,

should
have
been
performed
with the other ,
was long
neglected .
However , for these joint
purposes , they were
empowered to make and levy rates upon the several inha-
bitants
of the parish , by the same act of parliament
;
which was further explained
and enforced by subsequent
statutes .
The two great objects of this statute seem to have been ,
1. To relieve
the
impotent
poor , and them only .
2. To
find employment for such as were able to work
and this
principally by providing
stocks of raw materials
to
be
worked
up at their
separate
homes , instead of accumu-
lating all the poor in one common workhouse
; for , poli-
tical economy being little understood in those days , it was
looked
upon
as the duty of government
to find work for
all who
wanted it : and the
danger of interfering
with
trade , altering
the
price of labour , or underselling
the
industrious
poor who maintained
themselves without
as-
sistance , does not seem to have been thought of.
Such appears to have been the plan of the
statute of
queen Elizabeth ; in which one great defect was confining
the management of the poor to small
parochial
districts ,
frequently
incapable
of furnishing
proper work , or pro-
viding able directors
for them .
However , the laborious
poor were then at liberty to seek employment wherever it
was to be had : none being obliged
to reside in the places
of their settlement but such
as were unable or unwilling
to work, and
those places of settlement
being
only such
where they were born , or had made their abode , originally
for three years (t) , and afterwards
(in the
case of vaga-
bonds ) for one year only (u).
After the Restoration
a very different plan was adopted,
which rendered the employment of the poor more difficult ,
by authorising
the subdivision of parishes ; which greatly
increased
their
number , by confining
them all to their
respective districts
: which gave birth to the intricacy

our poor laws , by multiplying and rendering
more
easy
the methods of gaining settlements ; and , in consequence
,
created
an infinity of expensive law- suits
between
con-
tending neighbourhoods , concerning those settlements and
removals .
By the statute
13 & 14 Car . 2 , c. 12 , a legal
settlement
was
declared
to be gained
by birth : or by
inhabitancy ,
apprenticeship
or
service,
for
forty
days :
within which
period all intruders
were made removable
from
any parish by two justices of the peace , unless they
settled in a tenement of the annual
value of 10.
The
frauds
naturally consequent upon
this
provision ,
which
gave
settlement by so short
a residence , produced the
statute
1 Jac . 2 , c. 17 , which directed notice in writing to
be delivered
to
the parish
officers,
before
a settlement
could be gained by such residence .
Subsequent provi-
sions
allowed
other
circumstances
of notoriety
to be
equivalent to such notice given ; and those circumstances
were from time to time altered , enlarged , or restrained ,
whenever the
experience of new inconveniences ,
arising
daily from new regulations
, suggested the necessity of a
remedy .
The
power
given
by the
above-mentioned
statute
of
Charles II. , of removing persons likely to become
charge-
able as paupers , was found to operate prejudicially
in this
way , it prevented poor persons from going to a place where
they might
obtain
work, and
to
obviate
this
mischief
certificates
were invented .
A certificate might, by stat.
8 &

3 , c. 30, s .

churchwardens
and overseers
of the parish
in which
he
was settled , acknowledging
the fact of such settlement ,
and directed to the churchwardens
and overseers of some
other parish .
Armed with this protection , the certificated
person could not be removed from
the parish to which he
went unless he became
actually
chargeable , but as he was
(with some exceptions ) precluded
from
acquiring
a new
settlement by any length of residence, parishes were very
cautious
about
giving such
certificates , and
they

settlements.
The law of settlements , after
many changes, may be Lawof
now reduced to the following
general
heads ; or , a settle-
ment in
a
parish
may be
acquired :
1. By birth ; for ,
wherever
a child is first known to be, that is always
prima facie the place of settlement , until some other can
be shown (x).
But
though
the place of birth be primâ
facie the settlement , yet it is not conclusively
so ; for
there
is , 2.
Settlement by parentage , being the
settle-
ment of one's father or mother : a legitimate
child being
really settled in the parish where his father is settled (y) ;
and if he have no settlement , or it be unknown , then in
the parish in which
his mother was settled at the time
of her marriage
(2) , until the child
get a new settlement
for himself.
It was
formerly
held that
an illegitimate
child being
nullius filius could
only have a birth
settle-
ment , being
entitled
to none by parentage (a) ; but it is
now
enacted by 4 & 5 Will . 4 , c.
76 ,
s.
71 , that every
illegitimate
child born
after Aug.
14 ,
1834 ,
shall
have
its mother's
settlement till it attains the
age of sixteen
years ,
or
acquires
a settlement
in its own right .
If,
therefore , it attains
that
age without
having
acquired
a
settlement , it is remitted to the birth settlement it would
have had before the statute (b) .

.
A new settlement may be acquired in several ways ;
as,
3. By marriage .
For a woman , marrying
a man who is
settled in another
parish , changes
her
own
settlement ,
and immediately
acquires that of her husband ( c) . During
her marriage
she is unable
to acquire any settlement of
of her own (d ) but follows
that of her husband , however
often it may be changed .
Should
he have no settlement ,
or should it be unknown , she retains
her
maiden
settle-
ment (e) , but it is suspended during his life (ƒ) , as
she
cannot
be separated from him without his consent (g).
In
such a case
the wife's
settlement
is , however , only
suspended
, not
lost , and she can be removed to it after
her husband's
death , or if he has
abandoned
her, or is
absent when she becomes chargeable ( ).
From the fact
that a wife always has her husband's settlement , it follows
that on the marriage of a woman having
an illegitimate
child , such child is entitled
to the stepfather's settlement
until it has attained the age of sixteen years (i) .
4. The next method of gaining a settlement is by ap-
prenticeship
; for this purpose , there must inter alia be a
binding by deed , and a residence of at least forty days (k).
5. A settlement may also be gained by renting
a tene-
ment of the minimum
value of
107. , and residing
therein
for forty days (1) , though
since the passing of stat. 4 & 5
Will. 4 , c. 76 , no settlement
can be gained in this way,
unless the tenant
has been assessed to the poor rate , and
shall have paid the same
in respect of the tenement for
one year.
Closely connected with this mode of acquiring
a settlement , may be mentioned ,

6. A settlement
by paying
taxes .
It was originally
enacted that any person coming
to inhabit any town
or
parish , who should be charged with and pay his share
to-
wards the public
taxes in such place , should be deemed
to
have a settlement therein (m) .
This qualification
has been
much restricted by subsequent
enactments .
The scaven-
ger's rate , house tax, and
highway
rate (n) have been
excepted
from the taxes conferring
a settlement , the pro-
perty must
be of the value of
107.
per
annum (0) , there
must be an occupation for a year , and if the property does
not belong to the occupier , it must be a separate building
or land bona fide rented for 10l. a year at least for the term
of a whole year , and the rent
for the same to the amount
of 107. must have been actually paid (p) .
7. The last mode in which a settlement can now be
obtained is by estate .
As no man can be removed
from
his own property (q) , a man
may gain a settlement
by
residence for forty days on an estate of his own , of any
value if it come to him by descent or devise
(r) , but , if by
purchase , the
purchase money must amount
to
307. at
least (s ).
This settlement , however , only lasts as long as
the owner of the
estate
resides in the parish in which it
was situate , or within ten miles thereof (t) .
Formerly there
were
other methods
of obtaining
a
settlement , among which may be mentioned
forty days'
residence with notice , hiring and service , and
serving
an
office.
The first of these settlements was abolished by 33
Geo . 3, c. 101 , and the two latter by 4 & 5 Will . 4 , c. 76 ,
s. 64.
Any person not legally settled , may be removed from the
parish in which
he is residing , should
he become charge-
able to it, and may be taken to the place of his settlement .

There
are, however ,
certain
exceptions
to this
rule , of
which we may mention that no one can be removed from
a parish or union in which he has resided continually for
three (u) years ; nor can a widow , residing with her hus-
band
at the time
of death, be
removed within
twelve
months
afterwards (x) ; nor can a child under the age of
sixteen years , living with its father
or
mother , be re-
moved (y).
The
duty
of relieving
or removing
our poor formerly
devolved
on the overseers
, viz . , the churchwardens , who
are
overseers
ex
officio , and the
persons
appointed over-
seers
annually
by the justices (2), but by the 4
&
5
Will . 4 , c .
76 , the poor law commissioners , and by the
12
& 13 Vict.
c. 103 , the poor law board ( a ) were em-
powered to consolidate
any number of parishes
into
one
union for the relief of the poor .
This being done , each
parish
has to elect
one
or more guardians , who
act for
the relief of the poor in the union subject to the rules of
the
poor law board .
In this
case the
overseers have
nothing to do with giving relief , except in cases of sudden
emergency (6) ; they have, however , certain duties to per-
form in relation
to the election of guardians .
They are
bound to make and levy the poor rates, and have other
duties imposed upon them , most of which , however , may
be discharged
by
an
assistant
overseer ,
a paid officer
whom the inhabitants of each parish may appoint if they
think fit (c).

CHAPTER X.
THE
PEOPLE , WHETHER NATURAL -BORN
SUBJECTS ,
ALIENS ,
OR DENIZENS .
HAVING in the eight preceding
chapters treated of per-
sons clothed with magisterial
functions , I now proceed to
consider such as fall under the denomination of the people .
And herein all the inferior
and subordinate
magistrates ,
treated of in the last chapter , are included .
born sub-
giance.
The first and most obvious division of the people is into Natural-
natural -born
subjects
and
aliens .
Generally
speaking , jects.
natural -born
subjects
are
such
as
are born within the
dominions of the crown of England ; that is, within the
ligeance , or allegiance of the
sovereign : and
aliens , such
as are born out of it.
Allegiance
is the tie , or ligamen, Their
alle
which
binds the
subject
to
the sovereign
,
in
return
for
that protection
which the
sovereign
affords the subject
.
The thing itself
,
or
substantial
part
of
it
,
is
founded
in
reason and the nature
of
government
;
the name and the
form of
it
are
derived to
us from our Gothic
ancestors
.
Under the feudal
system
,
every owner
of
lands held them
.
in
subjection
to
some
superior
or
lord
,
from
whom
or
whose ancestors the tenant
or
vassal had
received them
;
and there was
a
mutual trust
or
confidence subsisting
be-
tween the lord
and vassal
,
that the lord
should
protect
the vassal
in
the enjoyment
of
the territory
granted
him
,
and
,
on the other hand
,
that the vassal should
be faithful
to
the lord
,
and defend him against all his enemies
.
This
obligation
on
the part
of
the vassal was called his fidelitas
or
fealty
;
and
an
oath
of
fealty
was required
,
by the
feudal law
,
to
be taken
by every tenant
to
his landlord
,


442
THE
PEOPLE .
couched
in almost the
same terms as our ancient oath of
allegiance (a) ; except that in the oath of fealty there was
frequently
a saving
or
exception
of the faith due
to a
superior lord by name , under whom the landlord
himself
was perhaps
only a tenant
or vassal .
But when the
ac-
knowledgment
was made to the absolute superior himself,
who was vassal to no man , it was no longer
called
the
oath of fealty , but the oath of allegiance ; and therein the
tenant swore to bear faith to his sovereign
lord, in
oppo-
sition to all men , without
any saving or exception ; " con-
tra omnes homines
fidelitatem fecit ” (b).
Land held by
this exalted species
of fealty was called feudum
ligium , a
liege fee ; the vassals homines ligi , or liege men ; and the
sovereign their
dominus
ligius , or liege lord .
And when
sovereign princes did homage to each other for lands held
under
their respective
sovereignties ,
a distinction
was
always
made between simple homage , which was only an
acknowledgment
of tenure (c) ; and liege homage , which in-
cluded the fealty before mentioned , and the services conse-
quent upon it.
Thus when our Edward III . , in 1329 , did
homage to Philip VI. of France , for his
ducal
dominions
on the continent , it was warmly
disputed of what
species
the homage was to be , whether liege or simple homage (d).
But with us, in England , it becoming
a settled
principle
of tenure , that all lands in the kingdom
are holden of the
sovereign as lord paramount , no oath but that of fealty
could
ever be taken to inferior
lords , and the
oath of
allegiance
was necessarily
confined to the person of the
sovereign .
By an easy
analogy the term " allegiance "
was soon brought to signify
all other engagements which
are due from
subjects to their
prince ,
as well
as those
duties which were simply and merely territorial .
And the
The oath of oath
of allegiance ,
as administered
for
upwards of six
hundred
years (e) , contained
a promise " to be true and
allegiance.

faithful to the king and his heirs , and truth
and faith to
bear of life and limb and terrene honour , and not to know
or hear of any
ill
or
damage
intended
him
,
without
defending
him
therefrom
."
Upon
which sir
Matthew
Hale
(ƒ
)
makes this remark
;
that
it
was short and plain
,
not entangled with long
or
intricate
clauses
or
declara-
tions
,
and yet was comprehensive
of
the whole duty from
the subject
to
his sovereign
.
But
,
at
the Revolution
,
the
terms
of
this oath being
thought
perhaps
to
favour
too
much the notion
of
non
-
resistance
,
another form
,
more
general
and indeterminate
,
was introduced by the conven-
tion
parliament
,
the
subject
only
promising
"
that
he
would be faithful and bear true allegiance
to
the king
,"
without
mentioning
"
his
heirs
,"
or
specifying
in
the
least wherein that allegiance might consist
.
The oath
of
supremacy was principally calculated
as
a
renunciation
of
the
pope's
pretended
authority
:
and the
oath
of
abju-
ration
,
introduced
in
the reign
of
king William
(g
),
very
amply supplied the loose and general texture
of
the oath
of allegiance
;
it
recognising
the right
of
his
majesty
,
derived under the act
of
settlement
:
engaging
to
support
him
to
the utmost
of
the juror's power
;
promising
to
dis-
close all
traitorous
conspiracies
against
him
;
and
ex-
pressly
renouncing
any claim
of
the descendants of the
pretender
,
in
as
clear and explicit terms
as
the English
language
could
furnish
.
This oath was required
to
be
taken by all persons
in
any office
,
trust
,
or
employment
;
and might
be
tendered
by
two justices
of
the peace
to
any
person whom they suspected
of
disaffection
().
And the
oath
of
allegiance might formerly have been tendered
(i)
to
any person above the age
of
twelve years
,
whether native
,
denizen
,
or
alien
,

in

county ; a refusal
to take it when duly tendered
being
indictable (k).
In regard
to the taking of the oaths above -mentioned
and the form of words which should be used to express alle-
giance , many important
changes have by statutes passed
during the
last
century
been
effected
;
these
changes
having been made in a truly liberal
spirit, with a view to
satisfying
religious
scruples , and so preventing
the exclu-
sion from various offices of men dissenting
from the reli-
gious tenets of our Established
Church , yet well qualified
to
serve the
state
and well -affected
towards the
crown .
The statutory
changes referred to need not here otherwise
than thus generally be noticed ( 1 ) , inasmuch as the subject
before us has by statute 31 & 32 Vict . c. 72 , been much
simplified , and put
upon
a basis likely to endure .
No
person can now " be required
or authorised
to take the
oaths of allegiance , supremacy ,
and
abjuration , or any
of such oaths , or any
oath
substituted
for
such
oaths
or any of them , or to make
any declaration
to the like
effect of such
oaths
or any of them " (m ) ,
except
the
persons indicated
in the above act, in the " Clerical
Sub-
scription
Act , 1865 " ( n ) , and the " Parliamentary
Oath's
Act , 1866 " (0).
The
statute
31
& 32 Vict .
c. 72 , moreover , prescribes
three forms of oath , respectively
constituting
the oath of
allegiance , the official , and the judicial oath .
By the first
of these, A. B. swears
that he " will be faithful and bear
true
allegiance
to her majesty
queen Victoria, her heirs
and
successors
, according
to law;" by the second , that
he " will well and truly serve " her majesty " in the office
of

he " will well and truly

With the first
of
the foregoing
oaths only have we here
any direct concern
;
but the consideration
of
it
cannot be
altogether
dissevered from that of the
other
two
.
The
effect
of
the statute
is
as
under
:
1st
,
the form of the
oath
of
allegiance
is
to
be
always
as
above
.
2ndly
.
The
official
or
the judicial
oath
must
,
in
conjunction
with the oath
of
allegiance
,
be
tendered
to
and
taken
by each
of
the
officers
(p
)
named
in
the schedule
(q)
to
the act
;
and
if
any such officer declines
or
neglects
to
take
any such
oath when
duly tendered
,
he shall
,
if
he has
already entered on his office
,
vacate the same
;
and
if
he
has not
entered upon
it
,
be
disqualified
from doing
so

Where an affirmation
or
a
declaration
is
under any
statute permitted
in
lieu
of
the oath
(r),
such affirmation
or declaration
is
to be mutatis mutandis in like form as the
oath for which
it
is
substituted
,
and the penalty for not
making
it
will be the same
(s).
But
,
besides express engagements
,
such
as
above
con-
sidered
,
the law holds
that there
is
an implied
,
original
,
and virtual allegiance
,
owing
from
every
subject
to
his
sovereign
,
antecedently
to
any
express
promise
;
and
although the
subject never swore any faith
or
allegiance
in
form
.
For
as
the
sovereign
,
by the
descent
of
the
crown
,
is
fully invested with all the rights
,
and bound
to
all the duties
of
sovereignty
,
before his coronation
;
so
the
subject
is
bound
to
his prince by an intrinsic allegiance
,
before
the
superinduction
of
outward
solemnities
,
and
irrespective
of
them
,
such formalities
having
been only
instituted
to
remind the subject
of
his previous duty
,
and
for the better
securing
its
performance
(t).
The profes-
sion
,
therefore
,
of
subjection
,
is
nothing
more
than
a
declaration
in
words
of
what was before implied
in
law
.

Allegiance
at commor
law.
6.6
Which
occasions
sir
Edward
Coke justly
to observe (u) ,
that
all subjects are equally bounden to their allegiance ,
as if they had taken the oath ;
because it is written by the
finger of the law in their
hearts , and the
taking
of the
corporal oath is but an outward declaration of the same."
The sanction of an oath, it is true , in case
of violation of
duty , makes the guilt still
more accumulated , by super-
adding
perjury
to treason : but it does not increase the
civil obligation
to loyalty ; it only strengthens
the social
tie by uniting it with that of religion
; and the policy of
our legislature
has of late
been
unmistakeably
evinced to
do away with unnecessary oaths .
Allegiance , expressed or implied , is distinguished
by
the common law into two sorts or species , the one natural ,
the
other local ; the
former
being
perpetual , the latter
temporary .
Natural allegiance is such as is due from all
men born within the dominions of the crown immediately
upon their birth (x) .
For , immediately
upon their birth ,
they are under the
sovereign's
protection : at a time too,
when
(during
infancy ) they
are incapable of protecting
themselves.
Natural
allegiance
is
therefore
a debt of
gratitude
which cannot (according to our customary law)
be forfeited ,
cancelled ,
or altered by any change of time ,
place ,
or circumstance , nor by anything
but the united
concurrence of the legislature (y) .
According
to our cus-
tomary law, an Englishman who removes to France , or to
China, owes the same allegiance to the sovereign of Eng-
land there as at home , and will owe it twenty years hence
as well as now.
For it is a principle of universal
law (2) ,
that the natural -born subject of one prince cannot by any
act of his own , no , not by swearing allegiance to another ,
put off or discharge his natural allegiance to the former : for
this
natural
allegiance
was intrinsic and primitive ,
and
antecedent to the other ; and cannot
be devested
without
the
concurrent
act of that prince
to whom it was first

due (a).
The
natural -born
subject
of
one
prince
to
whom
that
subject
owes
allegiance , may
indeed
be en-
tangled by subjecting
himself absolutely
to another : but
it is his
own act that brings
him into these straits
and
difficulties , of owing
service
to
two
masters ; and it is
unreasonable
that , by such voluntary
act of his own , he
should
be able
at pleasure to unloose
those
bands by
which he is connected
with and tied to his natural
prince .
Local allegiance
is such
as is due from an alien , or
stranger
born , for so long time
as he continues
within
the dominion
and protection of the crown (b) , and by our
customary law it ceases the instant such stranger transfers
himself from this kingdom
to another .
Natural allegi-
ance is therefore perpetual , and local allegiance temporary
only
for this
reason , evidently founded upon the nature
of government , that
allegiance
is a debt due from the
subject , upon an implied
contract with the prince , that so
(a) This
principle
may
be
ex-
emplified
by
the
case
of
Eneas
McDonald
(Fost . 184) .
There
a
native
of Great
Britain ,
who
had
received his education
from infancy
in France , had spent his riper years
in a profitable
employment
in that
kingdom , and had
accepted a com-
mission in the service of the French
king ; having , whilst acting
under
that commission ,
been
taken
in
arms
against the king of England ,
was indicted
and convicted
of high
treason ;
though
afterwards
par-
doned , on condition
of his leaving
the kingdom
for
ever.
In Doe v.
Acklam ,
2
B.
&
C.
779, it
was
held that
upon
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
United
States
of
America
in
1783, the
natural-born subjects
of the
crown
of England , adhering
to the United
States , became aliens to all intents
and purposes . In Doe v. Mulcaster ,
5 B. & C.
771, the converse
was
held , viz ., that children , born in the
United States after the recognition
of American
independence , of pa-
rents who had
resided there before,
but who were natural -born
British
subjects ,
and
at the
time
of the
separation of the two countries
ad-
hered to the British government ,
did
not
become
aliens ,
but
re-
mained
capable of inheriting lands
in this country . Again, in Marryat
v. Wilson, 8 T. R. 31 ; s. c. in error ,
1 B. & P.430 , a natural -born subject
of this
country , who had been ad-
mitted
a
citizen
of the
United
States , either before or after the de-
claration
of
American
indepen-
dence, was held to be
a subject of
the United States , so as to
be en-
titled to the benefit of all treaties
of
commerce
between
the
two
countries .

long as the one affords protection , so long
the
other will
demean himself faithfully .
As
therefore the prince
is
under
a constant tie to protect
his natural -born
subjects
at all times and in all countries , their allegiance due to
him is
equally
universal
and
permanent .
But , on the
other hand , as the prince affords his protection to an alien
only during his residence in this realm , the allegiance of
an alien is confined (in point of time ) to the duration of
such his residence , and
(in point of locality ) to the do-
minions
of the British
empire .
From which
considera-
tions
sif
Matthew Hale
(c)
deduces
this consequence
,
that
,
though there be an usurper
of
the crown
,
yet
it
is
treason
for any subject
,
while the
usurper
is
in
full possession
of
the sovereignty
,
to
practise
anything
against
his crown
and dignity
wherefore
,
although
the true
prince regain
the sovereignty
,
yet
such
attempts
against the
usurper
(
unless
in
defence
or
aid
of
the rightful king
)
have been
afterwards
punished with death
;
because of the breach of
that temporary allegiance
which was due
to
him
as
king
de
facto
.
And
upon this
footing
,
after
Edward
IV
.
recovered the crown
,
which
had
been long detained from
his house by the line of Lancaster
,
treasons committed
against
Henry VI
.
were
capitally
punished
;
though
Henry had been declared an usurper by parliament
.
The
oath
or
declaration
of
allegiance
,
or
rather
the
allegiance
itself
,
is
applicable
not
only
to
the political
capacity
or
regal
office
,
but
to
the
natural
person
and
blood
-
royal
of
the sovereign
:
and for the misapplication
of
their
allegiance
,
viz
.
to
the regal
capacity
or
crown
,
exclusive
of
the
person
of
the king
,
were the Spensers
banished
in
the reign
of
Edward
II
.
(d).
And
hence
arose that
principle
of
personal
attachment
and
affec-
tionate loyalty which
induced
our
forefathers
(
and
,
if
occasion required
,
would
doubtless
induce their
sons
)
to
hazard everything dear
to
them
,
life
,
fortune
,
and family
,
in
defence and support
of
their sovereign

law , if an alien born
purchase land for his own use , the
crown is thereupon entitled
to it (e). If an alien
could
acquire
a permanent
property in land , he must
owe
an
allegiance , equally permanent with that property , to the
crown of England ; which would
probably be inconsistent
with that which
he owes
to his
own natural
liege lord :
besides that thereby the
nation
might in time
become
subject to foreign
influence , and feel many other incon-
veniences (f).
Wherefore
by the
civil law
also
such
contracts were made void (g) : though the prince had no
advantage of forfeiture
thereby
as with us in England .
At common law, however , an alien might acquire a pro-
perty in goods , money , and other personal
estate , which
is of a transitory
and
moveable nature ,

residence , or of occupation ," " or for the purpose of any
business , trade ,
or manufacture ," for
any term not ex-
ceeding twenty -one years .
An alien may also contract or
maintain
an action concerning
personalty (k) , may make
a will , and dispose of his chattel property (1).
These rights
however can be exercised by alien
friends
only , or
such whose countries
are at peace with ours ; for
alien enemies
have no rights , no privileges (m) , unless by
the special
favour of the
sovereign
during
the
time of
war .
The proposition
that
an alien
is one born
out of the
queen's dominions , or allegiance , must be understood with
some restrictions .
The
common law indeed
stood abso-
lutely so , with only very few exceptions ; so that
a par-
ticular
act
of
parliament
became
necessary
after
the
Restoration (n), " for the naturalization
of children of his
majesty's
English
subjects ,
born in
foreign
countries
during
the late
troubles ."
And this maxim of the law
proceeded
upon
a general principle , that every man owes
natural
allegiance where he is born , and cannot owe two
such allegiances , or serve
two masters at once .
Yet the
children
of the
king's
ambassadors
born
abroad
were
always
held to be natural
subjects (o) ; for
as the father ,
though in a foreign
country , owes
not even a local alle-
giance to the prince to whom
he is sent ; so, with regard
to the son also, he was held (by a kind of postliminium )
to be born under the king of England's
allegiance , repre-
sented by his father , the ambassador.
To encourage also
foreign
commerce, it was enacted by statute 25 Edw . 3,

parents were at the time of birth in allegiance to the king ,
and the mother
had passed the
seas by her husband's
consent, might inherit as if born in England ; and these re-
strictions were afterwards still further taken off (p) ; so that
all children , born out of the ligeance of the crown , whose
fathers (or grandfathers by the father's
side ) were natural-
born
subjects , were to be
deemed
natural -born
subjects
themselves , to all intents and purposes ; unless their said
ancestors were attainted , or banished beyond sea , for high
treason ; or were at the birth of
such
children
in the
service of a prince
at enmity with Great
Britain .

by stat.

&

c . 6 , explained
by 25 Geo . 2,
c.
39, any
natural -born
subject
might inherit
and
be

to land , although
the ancestor through whom
the title might
be traced or derived , was born out of the
allegiance .
And further
by the
7 & 8 Vict .
c. 66 , s . 3 ,
every person
born
out of her majesty's
dominions
of a
mother being a natural -born subject of the United King-
dom , " shall
be
capable of taking to him,
his
heirs ,
executors , or administrators
, any estate , real or personal ,
by devise or purchase , or inheritance of succession."
The distinction
between an alien
and
a natural -born
subject being still , notwithstanding
the statutory changes
mentioned ,
exceedingly
material ,
the
legislature
has
deemed it expedient that
a person should
be enabled by
formal procedure to establish
his right to be deemed a
natural -born
subject of the
crown , and
has accordingly
enacted that
any natural -born

queen ,
or
any person whose right to

A denizen is an alien born , who has obtained ex donatione

high and incommunicable
branch of the royal

A denizen is in a kind of middle
state , between
an alien and a natural -born
subject , and partakes of the
privileges of each of them .
He may take
lands by pur-
chase or devise, which an alien may not ; but cannot take
by inheritance (t) ; for his parent , through whom he must
claim ,
being
an
alien ,

no

therefore
could

CHAPTER
XI.
THE
CLERGY .
THE
people , whether
natural -born
subjects ,
aliens , or
denizens , are divisible
into two kinds ; the clergy and the
laity
the
clergy comprehending
all persons in holy or-
ders, and in ecclesiastical offices , will be the subject of the
following
chapter .
:
The clergy have large privileges
allowed
them by our
municipal
laws : and had formerly
much
greater , which
were abridged
at the time of the Reformation
on account
of the
ill
use which the popish priests
had endeavoured
to
make
of them
.
For
,
the
laws
having
exempted
the
Catholic
priesthood from almost every personal duty
,
they
attempted
a
total
exemption
from secular ties
.
But
it
is
observed by sir Edward
Coke
(a),
that
,
as
the overflowing
of waters
doth
many
times
make the river
to
lose its
proper
channel
,
so
in
times
past
ecclesiastical
persons
,
seeking
to
extend their liberties beyond their true bounds
,
either lost
or
enjoyed not those which
of
right
belonged
to
them
.
Some
such personal
exemptions
do
,
however
,
continue
.
A
clergyman
cannot
be
compelled
to
serve
on
a
jury
(6).
Neither can he
be
compelled
to
serve
as
bailiff
,
constable
,
or
the like
,
in
regard
of
his own
continual
attendance on the sacred function
(c).
During his attend-
ance
on divine
service he
is
privileged
from
arrest
in
a
civil
suit

the actual
continuance of such service (e).
A clergyman
also , whilst engaged in performing
any
parochial
duty
within his parish is exempt from toll (ƒ).
But
as the clergy
have their privileges ,
so also they
have their disabilities , on account of their spiritual avoca-
tions .
A clergyman
is incapable of sitting
in the house
of commons (g) , or of being a councillor
or alderman
of
any borough ( ) ; and by statute
1 & 2 Vict. c. 106 , s . 28,
spiritual
persons
are forbidden to take to farm for occupa-
tion
more than
eighty
acres , except with the consent of
the
bishop , (and then
not for more than
seven
years ,)
under
a penalty of 40s. per annum
for
each
acre
above
eighty .
By sect. 29 of the same act, spiritual
persons ,
beneficed
or performing
ecclesiastical
duty , are also for-
bidden to engage in trade or buy to sell again for profit
or gain ( ).
But
by sect.
30 , this prohibition
does
not
extend to spiritual
persons engaged in keeping schools , or
in education , in respect of anything
done or any buying or
selling
in such employment , or to selling
anything
bonâ
fide bought for the use of the family, or to being a mana-
ger , director , or shareholder in any benefit or life or fire
assurance society ; or to buying
and selling
cattle (if not
in person) , where incidental
to the occupation of glebe or
other land , which any such
spiritual
person may lawfully
hold (k).
Of the clergy there are divers ranks and degrees ; which
will here be considered in their respective order , merely as
they are taken notice of by the secular laws of England ;
without
intermeddling
with the canons (j) and constitu-

I. An archbishop
or a bishop is elected
by the chapter
of his
cathedral
church , by virtue of a licence
from
the
crown .
Election
was, in very early times , the usual mode
of elevation
to the episcopal
chair throughout
Christen-
dom ; and this
was promiscuously
performed by the
laity
as well
as
the
clergy (1) :
till
at length , it
becoming
tumultuous , the
emperors
and
other
sovereigns of the
respective kingdoms
of Europe
took
the appointment
in
some degree into their own hands ; by reserving to them-
selves
the
right of confirming
these
elections , and
of
granting investiture of the temporalities , which now began
almost universally
to be annexed to this spiritual dignity ;
without which confirmation
and
investiture , the
elected
bishop could neither be consecrated nor receive any secular
profits .
This right
was
acknowledged
in
the
emperor
Charlemagne ,
A.D.
773, by
pope Hadrian I., and
the
council of Lateran (m) , and universally
exercised by other
christian
princes : but the policy of the court of Rome at
the same time began by degrees
to exclude the laity from
any share in these
elections, and to confine them wholly
to the clergy , which at length was completely effected
; the
mere form of election appearing to the people to be a thing
of little consequence
, while the crown was in possession of
an absolute
negative , which
was almost equivalent
to a
direct right of nomination .
Hence
the right of appoint-
ing to bishoprics
is said to have been in the crown
of
England (n), even in the Saxon times : because
the rights
of confirmation
and investiture were in effect equivalent to
a right of complete donation (o).

of time , the custom of making elections by the clergy only
was fully
established , the
popes
began to except to the
usual
method of granting
these investitures , which
was
per annulum et baculum, by the prince's
delivering
to the
prelate
a ring, and pastoral
staff or crosier : pretending
that this was an encroachment on the church's
authority ,
and
an attempt by these symbols
to
confer
a spiritual
jurisdiction
and pope Gregory VII., towards the close of
the eleventh century , published
a bull of excommunication
against all princes who should dare to confer investitures ,
and all prelates who should venture
to receive
them (p).
This was a bold step towards effecting the plan then adopted
by the Roman
see , of rendering
the
clergy entirely inde-
pendent of the civil authority
: and long and eager
were
the contests
occasioned
by this papal claim . But at length ,
when the emperor Henry V. agreed
to remove all suspicion
of encroachment on the spiritual
character , by conferring
investitures
for the future per sceptrum
and not per annu-
lum
et baculum ;
and
when the kings of England and
France
consented
also to alter the form in their kingdoms ,
and
receive
only homage from the bishops for their têm-
poralities , instead of investing
them by
the
ring and
crosier ; the court of Rome
found it prudent
to suspend
for a while its other pretensions .
This
concession was obtained
from king Henry I. in
England , by means of that obstinate and arrogant prelate ,
archbishop
Anselm ( ) ; but king John
(about a century
afterwards ) , in order to obtain the protection of the pope
against his discontented
barons, was also prevailed upon
to give up by a charter , to all the monasteries and cathe-
drals
in the
kingdom , the
free right of electing their

of Canterbury
was abolished at the Reformation
(6) .
The
archbishop
is entitled to present by lapse to all the eccle-
siastical livings in the disposal of his diocesan bishops , if
not filled within six months .
And the
archbishop
had
formerly
a customary prerogative , when a bishop was con-
secrated by him, to name a clerk
or chaplain of his own
to be provided
for by such suffragan bishop ; in lieu of
which it was usual for the bishop to make over by deed to
the archbishop , his executors and assigns , the next pre-
sentation of such dignity or benefice in the bishop's dis-
posal within that see , as the
archbishop
himself should
choose
; which was therefore called his option ( c) ; options
seem , however ,
to
have been
abolished ,
perhaps unde-
signedly , by stat . 3 & 4 Vict . c. 113 , s . 42 , which
enacts
that " it shall not be lawful for any spiritual
person to sell

shall be null and

It is likewise the privilege , by custom , of the archbishop
of Canterbury , to

the power of granting
dispensations in any case , not con-
trary to the holy scriptures and the law of God , where the
pope used
formerly
to grant them ; which is the founda-
tion of his granting
special licences to marry at any place
or time , dispensation
to hold two livings (now regulated
by stat . 1 & 2 Vict . c. 106 , ss . 5-7 ) and the like : and on

ARCHBISHOPS
AND
BISHOPS .
461
The power and authority of a bishop ,
besides the
ad-
ministration
of holy
ordinances , are exercised principally
in
inspecting
the
manners of the
clergy , and punishing
them in order to reformation , by ecclesiastical
censures .
By 3 & 4 Vict. c.
86 , a bishop
is
empowered to issue a
commission of inquiry against , and to pronounce ecclesi-
astical
sentence
upon
any
clergyman
charged with an
offence against the laws ecclesiastical , or concerning whom
there may exist
scandal or evil
report
as having offended
against those laws : and in the mean time such clergyman
may be inhibited
by the bishop from
performing
services
in the church .
Proceedings under this act, however , must
be commenced within two years after the commission of
the offence (ƒ).
A bishop
has several courts under him , and may visit
at pleasure
every part of his
diocese .
His
chancellor is
appointed to hold his courts for him, and to assist him in
matters of ecclesiastical law ; and must
be
a master of
arts or bachelor of civil law, so
created
in some
univer-
sity (g).
It is also the business of a bishop to institute ,
and to direct
induction
to all ecclesiastical
livings
in his
diocese .
But upon the promotion of the incumbent of a
benefice in England
to a bishopric
the right to present to
the avoided benefice
is in the crown .
Archbishoprics
and
bishoprics
may
become void by
death, deposition
for any very gross and notorious crime ,
and also by resignation .
All resignations
must
be made
to some superior (h).
Therefore
a bishop
must
resign to
his
metropolitan
;
whereas an archbishop
can
resign to
none but the sovereign .
(f) See further as to the proce-
dure
under
the
above
act, post,

When an incumbent
has a parish
consisting
of two
benefices with a
church in each of them ,it is his duty
to perform
a service every
Sunday
in each of such
churches , and the

THE CLERGY .
(II.) Dean
and chap-
ter.
It was an ancient custom that , when a bishop was absent
from his
diocese
on an embassy , or by age or other in-
firmity became
unable to fulfil his episcopal office (1) , his
spiritual
duties of ordaining
and so forth , were committed
to
a suffragan
bishop , who was also called a " chorepis-
copus," while his jurisdiction in collating , instituting, &c.
was entrusted to a " coadjutor ."
But now by 6 & 7 Vict.
c. 62, it is provided , that when
any archbishop or bishop
shall
have
been
reported
by
commissioners
appointed
under
the act, to
be incapable
by reason of mental
in-
firmity (k), or shall
have been found lunatic under a com-
mission
de lunatico inquirendo (1) , and therefore incapable
of duly performing
his
archiepiscopal
or episcopal func-
tions ,
one of the
other
bishops
shall
be
appointed
to
perform
such functions , and another
spiritual
person to
assist in the administration
of the temporalities of the see ,
until the death or recovery of such archbishop or bishop .
II. A dean and chapter
are the council of the bishop ,
to assist him with their
advice in affairs of religion , and
also in the temporal
concerns of his
see (m) .
When the
rest of the clergy were settled in the several parishes of
each
diocese
(as
before mentioned ) ,
these
were reserved
for the
celebration of divine
service in the bishop's own
cathedral
; and the chief of them , who presided
over the
rest , obtained the name of decanus
or dean , either because
he was at first
appointed
to
superintend
ten canons
or
prebendaries ,
or more
probably
because
a deanery ,
de-
cennary, or tithing, was originally a district including
ten
parishes or churches (n).

the ancient

are now , however, by statute 3 & 4

patronage of the queen ,
who appoints

and in
those
chapters
that
were founded by Henry VIII . out of the
spoils of the dissolved monasteries , the deanery
has always
been donative , and
the installation

The
chapter ,
consisting
of
canons (r), are sometimes
appointed by the crown
and
sometimes by the bishop .
The dean and

the exceptions before
noticed , the nominal
electors of a bishop .
The bishop is
their ordinary and immediate superior ; and has , generally
speaking , the power of visiting them .
Deaneries
and
canonries
may
become
void ,
like
a
bishopric , by death , by deprivation , or by resignation
to
either the crown or the bishop (s) .

are
very
ancient
officers of the
church (a) , who seem to have been deputies of the bishop ,
planted
round
his
diocese , the better to inspect
the con-
duct of the parochial
clergy , to inquire
into
and
report
dilapidations , to examine the candidates for confirmation
,
and armed , in minuter
matters , with an inferior
degree of
judicial and coercive authority (y) .
Rural deaneries still
subsist
as an ecclesiastical
division of a diocese
or arch-
deaconry , although
custom seems
to have transferred
to
the archdeacon the necessary and more active duties of
such office (*).
V. The next , and most numerous , order of men , in the
system of ecclesiastical polity, are the parsons : in treat-
ing of whom I shall first mark out the distinctions amongst
them ; shall next
observe
the method by which one may
become a parson
or incumbent ; shall
then
briefly
touch.
upon his
rights and duties ; and shall , lastly , show how
one may cease to be such .
A parson , persona
ecclesiæ , is
one who has full posses-
sion of all the rights of a parochial church .
He is called
parson , persona , because
by his person the church , which
is an invisible
body , is represented : and he is in himself a
body corporate , in order to protect
and defend the rights
of the church (which he personates) by a perpetual succes-
sion (a).
He is sometimes called the rector or governor
of the church : but the
appellation of parson (however it
may be depreciated by familiar and indiscriminate
use) ,

is the most
legal , most beneficial , and most
honourable
title that a parish
priest can enjoy ; because
such a one
(sir Edward Coke observes ) , and he only , is said vicem seu
personam ecclesiæ
gerere .
A parson
has, during his life,
the freehold in himself of the parsonage house , the glebe ,
the tithes , and
other dues .
But
a living
is sometimes
appropriated
; that is to say, the benefice
was, in Catholic
times , perpetually annexed to some spiritual corporation ,
either
sole or aggregate , being the patron of the living ;
which the law esteemed
equally capable of providing
for
the service of the
church , as
any single
private
clergy-
man .
This contrivance
seems
to have sprung from the
policy of the monastic orders , who were never deficient in
subtle inventions
for the increase of their own power and
emoluments .
At the
first
establishment
of
parochial
clergy , the tithes of the parish were distributed
in a four-
fold division
; one for the use of the bishop , another for
maintaining the fabric of the church , a third for the poor ,
and the fourth to provide for the incumbent .
When the
sees of the
bishops
became
otherwise
amply
endowed
,
they were prohibited
from demanding their usual share of
these tithes , and the division
was into three parts
only .
And hence it was inferred by the monasteries , that a small
part was sufficient
for the officiating
priest
; and that the
remainder
might well
be
applied to the use of their own
fraternities
(the endowment of which was construed to be
a work of the most exalted piety ) , subject to the burthen of
repairing
the church , and providing
for its constant sup-
ply.
And therefore
they begged and bought , for masses
and obits , and sometimes
even
for money , all the advow-
sons within their
reach, and then
appropriated the bene-
fices to the use of their
own
corporations .
But , in order
to complete any such appropriation
effectually , the licence
of the crown , and consent of the bishop , must first have
been obtained : because
both
the crown
and the bishop
might some
time or other have had an interest , by lapse ,
in the presentation to the benefice ; and a lapse could not

happen if the benefice were appropriated
to the use of a
corporation , which
never dies ; and also
because
the law
reposes
a confidence in the
crown and bishop , that they
will not consent to anything
that shall be to the prejudice
of the church .
The consent of the patron also was neces-
sarily implied : because
(as
above
observed) the appro-
priation
could
be originally made to
none, but to
such
spiritual corporation , as was also the patron of the church ;
the whole
being
indeed nothing else , than
an allowance
for the patrons to retain the tithes and glebe in their own
hands ,
without
presenting
any
clerk , they
themselves
undertaking
to provide
for
the service of the church (6) .
When the appropriation
had thus
been
made, the appro-
priators
and their
successors
were perpetual
parsons of
the church
; and any such corporation
must still sue and
be sued in matters concerning the rights of the church , in
the name of the parson (c).
In the manner
above
mentioned
were most , if not all ,
of the appropriations
at present existing originally made :
being
annexed to bishoprics , prebends , religious
houses ,
nay, even
to nunneries and certain military orders , all of
which were spiritual
corporations .
At the dissolution
of
monasteries by statutes 27 Hen . 8 , c. 28 , and 31 Hen . 8 ,
c. 13 , the appropriations
of the several
parsonages , which
belonged to those respective religious houses (amounting
to more than one -third of all the parishes in England (d) ) ,
would
have been by the rules of the common law disap-
propriated , had not a clause in those statutes intervened ,
to
give them to the
king in
as
ample
a manner
as
the
abbots, &c . , formerly
held
the same , at the time of
their dissolution .
This was not without
example ; for the
same had
been done in former
reigns , when
the alien
priories
(that is , such as
were filled
by foreigners
only)
were dissolved
and given to the crown ( e) .

these two roots sprung
the lay appropriations
or secular
parsonages
now
existing
in the
kingdom
; they
having
been afterwards
granted
out
from
time to time by the
crown (f).
The
appropriating
corporation , or religious
house, was
wont to depute
one of its own
body to perform
divine
service , and administer
the sacraments , in those parishes
of which the society was thus the parson .
This officiating
minister was in reality no more than a curate , deputy , or
vicegerent of the appropriator , and therefore called vica-
rius or vicar .
His
stipend was
at the
discretion
of the
appropriator , who was however bound of common right to
find somebody, qui illi de temporalibus, episcopo
de spiritu-
alibus , debeat
respondere (g) .
But this was done in
so
scandalous
a manner , and the parishes
suffered
so much
by the
neglect of the
appropriators , that the legislature
was forced to interpose : and accordingly it was enacted
by statute
15 Ric.
2 , c.
6, that
in all appropriations
of
churches , the diocesan bishop should ordain (in proportion
to the value of the church ) a competent sum to be dis-
tributed among the poor parishioners
annually
; and that
the vicarage should be sufficiently
endowed.
The parishes
it seems
were frequently
sufferers , not only by the want
of divine
service , but
also
by the
withholding
of those
alms for providing which,
among
other
purposes , the
payment of tithes was originally imposed : and therefore
in this act a pension was directed to be distributed
among
the poor parochians , as well as a sufficient stipend to the
vicar.
But he , being liable to be removed at the pleasure
of the appropriator , was not likely to insist too rigidly on
the
legal
sufficiency
of the
stipend :
and
therefore by
statute 4 Hen. 4 ,
c.
12 , it was
ordained , that
the vicar
should be a secular person , not a member of any religious
(
Sir H. Spelman
(Of Tithes, c.
29), says , these are now called im-
propriations
,
as being
improperly
in the hands
of laymen .

house ; that he
should be vicar
perpetual , not
removable
at the caprice of the monastery ; and that he
should
be
canonically
instituted
and
inducted ,
and be sufficiently
endowed, at the discretion of the ordinary , for these three
express
purposes , to do divine service , to inform the people ,
and to keep hospitality .
The endowments in consequence
of these statutes were usually by a portion of the glebe or
land belonging
to the parsonage , and a particular
share of
the tithes which the appropriators
found it most trouble-
some to collect , and which
are therefore generally
called
small
tithes ; the greater , or predial ,
tithes
being
still
reserved to their own use.
But one and
the
same rule
was not
observed
in the
endowment
of all vicarages
;
some
were
more
liberally,
and
some
more
scantily ,
endowed
the
tithes ,
for
instance ,
of
certain
things,
as
wood ,
being
in
some
parishes
rectorial ,
and
in
some vicarial .
The
nature of tithes , however , will be
discussed at large in the ensuing
volume of these Com-
mentaries .
An appropriation
may be severed , and the church be-
come disappropriate , two ways : as first, if the patron
or
appropriator
presents a clerk , who is instituted
and in-
ducted to the parsonage
for the incumbent
so instituted
and inducted is
to all intents
and
purposes
complete
parson
and the appropriation , being
once
severed ,
can
never be reunited
again ,
unless by a repetition of the
same solemnities (h ) .
And , when the clerk so presented
is distinct from the vicar , the rectory thus vested in him
becomes what is called a sinecure ; because
he has no cure
of souls , having a vicar
under him to whom that
cure is
committed .
Also, if the
corporation
which
has
the
appropriation
is
dissolved , the parsonage becomes
disap-
propriate
at common
law ;
because
the
perpetuity
of
person is gone, which is necessary to support the appro-
priation .

need here be
offered , inasmuch
as they will
before long
have passed away by the operation of sect. 48 (k) of the
statute
3 & 4 Vict . c.
113 , which
provides for the sup-
pression of all such as
are in the
sole
patronage of the
crown , or of any
ecclesiastical
corporation
aggregate or
sole, where there is a vicar endowed
or a perpetual curate ,
as vacancies
may occur , also for the purchase by the eccle-
siastical commissioners of any other such rectory , without
cure of souls , the
advowson
whereof ,
or
any
right of
patronage
wherein , may
belong
to any
person
or body
corporate
other than
as aforesaid , and the suppression of
the same upon the first avoidance thereof.
The
main
distinction
at law between
a rector
and a
vicar is this : the rector has for the most part the right to
ecclesiastical
dues in his
parish ;
whereas a
vicar
has
generally
an appropriator
over him entitled
to the best
part of his
profits , to whom , if appropriations
had con-
tinued
as in their origin , he would in effect
have
been
perpetual curate with a standing
salary .
In pursuance of
a series of statutes , however , which
cannot here be speci-
fically noticed (1) many new districts
for church purposes ,
and new parishes with cure of souls have , under the su-
perintendence
of the
ecclesiastical
commissioners , been
formed ;
many of the smaller
benefices
are
gradually
being
augmented (m) , and the designation
of our clergy
has in anomalous
cases
been determined .
For it has
recently been enacted (n) that the incumbent of the church

not being a rector , who is authorised

to take
for his sole use and benefit the entire fees arising from
the performance of such offices shall, " for the purpose of
style
and designation , but not for any other purpose , be
deemed and styled the vicar " of such church or parish ,
and his benefice shall be styled a vicarage .
The method of becoming a parson
or a vicar is much
the same.
To it there are four requisites : holy orders,
presentation , institution, and induction .
The method of
conferring the holy orders of deacon and priest , according
to the liturgy and canons, is foreign
to the purpose of
these Commentaries , any further than
as they are neces-
sary requisites to make a complete parson or vicar .
By
common law, a deacon , of any age, might be instituted
and inducted
to a parsonage
or vicarage :
but it was
ordained by statute
13 Eliz . c.
12 , that no person under
twenty-three years of age, and in deacon's orders, should
be presented to any benefice with cure ; and if he were
not ordained priest within one year after his induction , he
should be ipso facto deprived : also by statute 13 &
14
Car. 2, c. 4, it was enacted that no person
should be
capable of being
admitted
to any benefice, unless he had
been first ordained a priest ; and so become, in the lan-
guage of the law, a clerk in orders.
Further, the 34th
canon, A.D.
1603, prescribes that no bishop
shall
admit
any person into sacred
orders, except he, desiring to be a
deacon, is three-and-twenty years old ; and , to be a priest,
four-and-twenty
years
complete ;
and this
canon
was
affirmed by the statute 44
Geo. 3, c. 43, s.
1, which
enacts that the admission
of persons to be priests
or
deacons within the above ages
respectively , " shall be
void in law, as if such admission
had not been made, and
the
person
so
admitted
shall
be wholly
incapable
of
having , holding , or enjoying , or being
admitted
to any
parsonage, vicarage , benefice or other ecclesiastical
pro-
motion or dignity whatsoever, in virtue of such his admis-
sion as deacon or priest respectively , or of any qualification

Provided
always , that
no title to confer
or present by lapse
shall
accrue by any
avoidance
or
deprivation
ipso facto , by
virtue of this statute, but after six months ' notice of such
avoidance or deprivation
given
by the
ordinary
to the
patron ."
Any
clerk
may be presented (p) to
a
parsonage
or
vicarage ; that is , the patron (9) , to whom the advowson
of the church
belongs , may offer his
clerk to the bishop
of the diocese
to be instituted .
Of advowsons , and the
right of presentation , being a species
of private
property ,
we shall find a more
convenient
place
to
treat
in the
second volume of these Commentaries .
It
must
suffice
for
the
present
to
observe
that
an
advowson is,
by the
law of England ,
a
lay inhe-
ritance ,
its
fruit
or
benefit being
that
,
upon
a
vacancy
of
the living
,
the
owner
possesses
a
right
to
present
to
the
bishop
a
person
in
holy
orders
(
or
who
can
obtain
holy
orders
before
admittance
),
to
be by him
admitted
and instituted
.
The
only obligation
which the
law
imposes upon
the
patron
in
the
exercise
of
this
right
is
that
he
should
present
a
fit
person
,
and
the
duty
of
the bishop
is
to
ascertain the fitness
of
the clerk
presented
to
him
(r).
The
bishop
must
satisfy himself
that the presentee
is
of
fit
age
,
and
in
holy
orders
,
and
likewise
as
to
his learning
,
his faith
or
orthodoxy
,
and
his moral conduct
.
The right
of
presentation
to
a
benefice
being
,
as
above
mentioned
,
a
mere temporal
right
,
it
follows that
if
the
patron presents
a
fit
person who produces all the proofs
of
his
fitness which the
bishop
can properly
require
,
the
patron
may claim
to
have his
clerk
admitted
,

for any reason determined
upon by the bishop
the clerk
should prove unfit, the patron is entitled to notice thereof
from the bishop , who could
not
legally
collate
his
own
clerk by lapse without giving it (s).
The remedy of the clerk
against
the bishop , if rejected
on insufficient
grounds , is by duplex
querela , or rescript
from the appellate
court (t) , directed
to the bishop , and
calling upon
him
to show
cause
why , by reason of his
neglect to do justice , the right of institution
is
not de-
volved to the superior judge (u). The remedy of the patron
as
against
the
bishop , if his
presentee
be
improperly
rejected , is by action of quare impedit (x) at the
common
law, to try, 1st, whether
the
plaintiff had the right to
present ; and if so , 2ndly , whether
he has presented a fit
person .
If an action at law be brought by the patron
against
the bishop
for
refusing
his clerk ,
the bishop
must , by
plea , assign the
cause of such refusal , so that the tem-
poral
court
may judge of its
sufficiency .
If the
plea
alleges
unfitness , its truth will be determined by a jury ,
should the cause of unfitness alleged be a crime , or by the
certificate of the metropolitan if it be insufficiency
; and
for the purpose of determining
either of such issues , the
court of common law, according
as the case may be , either
summons
a jury ,
or
sends
a writ to the metropolitan ,
commanding him in the queen's name to try the question ,
and to certify
the result to the court .
By the course of
proceeding in quare impedit , accordingly , questions of law
are left for the decision of the court of law, questions of
fact for that of the jury ,
and
questions of doctrine
are
submitted to the metropolitan
(y).

presentee, the clerk
so
admitted , after
making
the
declarations
and taking the oaths required
by the
undermentioned
statutes (2 ) , is next to be instituted
by
him ; which is
a kind of investiture of the spiritual
part
of the benefice : for by institution the care of the souls of
the parish is committed to the charge of the clerk .
When
the ordinary
is also the
patron , and confers the living ,
the presentation
and
institution
are one and the
same
act , and are called a collation
to a benefice. By institution
or collation
the
church is full , so that
there can be no
fresh
presentation till
another
vacancy , at least in the
case of a common
patron :
but the
church
is
not full
against the crown till induction
: nay , even if a
clerk is
instituted
upon
presentation , the
crown
may
revoke it
before induction , and
present
another
clerk (a) .
Upon
institution also the clerk may enter
on the
parsonage-
house and glebe , and take the tithes
; but he cannot grant
or let them , or bring an action for them till induction .
Induction
is performed by a mandate from the bishop ,
usually
directed
to
the
archdeacon ,
who
issues
out
a
precept to other clergymen to perform it for him .
It is
done by giving the clerk corporal possession of the church ,
as by holding
the ring of the door, tolling
a bell, or the
like
and is a form
required by law, with intent
to give
all the parishioners
due
notice , and sufficient certainty of
their new minister , to whom their tithes
are to be paid .
This therefore
is the investiture
of the temporal part of
the benefice, as institution
is of the spiritual .
And when
a clerk is thus
presented , instituted , and inducted into a
rectory , he is then , and not before, in full and
complete
possession , and

principally of ecclesiastical
cognizance ;
those
only ex-
cepted which are laid upon him by statute , and are indeed
so numerous , that it is impracticable
to recite them here
with a tolerable
conciseness
or accuracy.
Some of them
we may remark
as they arise in the progress of our in-
quiries , but for
the
rest I must
refer
myself
to
such
authors
as
have
compiled
treatises
expressly
upon this
subject. I shall only just mention the article of residence ,
upon the supposition of which the law styles
every paro-
chial minister an incumbent (b).
Although an oath
is not
now
as formerly
required of
any vicar in relation
to residence
on
his vicarage (c) , the
maxim of law is , vicarius non
habet vicarium : and , as the
non -residence of the appropriators
was the
cause of the
perpetual
establishment
of vicarages , the law judges it
improper for them to defeat the end of their constitution ,
and by absence
to create the very mischief
which
they
were
appointed
to remedy :
especially
as , if any profits
are to arise from
putting in a curate, and living
at
a
distance from the parish , the appropriator , who is the real
parson , has undoubtedly
the elder title to them .
The law concerning non -residence and pluralities
is now
regulated by stats .
1 & 2 Vict . c. 106 , and
13 &
14 Vict.
c. 98, the former of which enacts (d) that if any spiritual
person holding
any benefice
shall fail to keep residence on
his benefice
as
directed by the act , he shall , when
such
absence
exceeds
three
months
and
does
not
exceed
six
months , forfeit
one -third part of the annual value of the
benefice so neglected ;
when
such
absence
exceeds
six
and does
not exceed
eight
months , one-half part of such
annual value ; when such
absence
exceeds
eight
months ,
two -thirds of such annual value ; and when
such absence
has been for the whole year , three-fourth parts thereof (e) .

HOW
RECTORS
AND
VICARS
CEASE
TO
BE
SUCH .
475
From
the requirements of the
above
statute as to resi-
dence
certain
persons , however ,
are
exempted (ƒ) , and
in particular
cases
the
bishop
at his
discretion
is em-
powered to grant licences for non -residence (g).
With regard to pluralities
, the effect of the two statutes
last cited is that
two
benefices
with cure of souls cannot
be held
together unless
they
are situated within
three
miles of each
other , by the nearest road from
church to
church , and the net annual value of neither of them ex-
ceeds
100 %. If the population of one benefice
exceeds three
thousand , another
having
a population of more than five
hundred
cannot be held with it , and no clergyman hold-
ing more than one
benefice
can take any other
or
any
cathedral preferment (h).
A dispensation
from compli-
ance with the above
provisions
may , in certain cases , be
obtained
from
the
arch-diocesan (i).
If any
spiritual
person
holding
any
benefice
accepts
another ,
and
is
admitted
thereto
contrary
to the foregoing
statutes , his
previous benefice
is at once vacated
(k) .
and vicars
such.
Although there is but one way whereby a person may How rectors
become a rector or vicar : there are several ways by which
ceaseto be
he may cease to be such.
1.
By death .
2. By
cession ,
in taking another
benefice .
3. By consecration ; for , as
before mentioned (1) ,
when
a
clerk
is
promoted
to
a
bishopric
all his
other preferments
are void the instant
that
he is consecrated
( m ).

thereof , such perpetual curate is appointed by the appro-

They
are sometimes appointed by the minister ,
sometimes by the parish , sometimes by both
together , or
in such other
manner
as custom
directs (r) .
They
are
taken , in favour of the church , to be for
some purposes a
kind of corporation at the common law ( s) ; that is , they
are enabled, as churchwardens , to have a property in goods
and chattels , and to bring actions for them , for the use and
profit of the parish .
Yet they may not waste the church
goods ; if they do so , they may be removed by the parish
and then called to account by action at the common law.
As to lands , or other real property , as the church , church-
yard , &c. , the
churchwardens
have no sort
of interest
therein ; but if any damage
is
done
thereto , the
parson
only or vicar shall have the action .
Their
office also is to
repair the church , and propose rates for that purpose
of
which , however , the payment is no longer compulsory (t).
Further , it is for the churchwardens
to see that everything
necessary for the performance of divine service
is provided ,
and that the churchyard is properly maintained
and fenced .
Churchwardens
of a parish , or reputed parish , are ex officio
overseers of the poor (u) .
They are empowered to keep all
persons orderly during the performance of divine
service ,
and to eject from the church , without unnecessary violence ,
any person
interrupting
it (x) ; to which
end it has been
held
that a churchwarden
may justify the pulling off a
man's
hat , without
being guilty of an assault

CHAPTER
XII.
THE
CIVIL
STATE .
THE lay part of her majesty's
subjects , or such of the
people as are not comprehended
under the denomination
of clergy , may be divided
into
three
distinct
states , the
civil , the military, and the maritime .
That part of the nation which
falls under our first and
most comprehensive
division , the civil state, includes all
orders of men , from the highest
nobleman to the meanest
peasant, who
are not
included
either
under
our former
division , of clergy , or under
one of the two
latter divi-
sions , viz. , the
military and
maritime
states
: it
may
indeed include individuals
of the other three orders : since
a nobleman , a knight , a gentleman , or a peasant, may
become either a divine , a soldier , or a seaman.
The civil state consists of the nobility and the common-
alty.
Of the nobility , the peerage of Great
Britain , or
lords temporal , as forming
(together with the bishops ) one
of the supreme branches of the legislature , I have before
sufficiently
spoken : we are here to consider them accord-
ing to their several degrees , or titles of honour .
All degrees
of nobility and honour are derived from the
crown
as their fountain
(a ) : and the
sovereign
may
at
pleasure institute
new titles .
Hence it is that all degrees
of nobility
are
not of
equal
antiquity .
Our English
nobility now consist of dukes , marquises , earls, viscounts ,
and barons (b).

STATE .
Duke.
Marquis.
1. A duke , though he be with us, in respect of his title
of nobility, inferior
in point of antiquity
to many others ,
yet is superior to all of them in rank ; his being the first
title of dignity amongst civilians
after the royal family (c).
Among the Saxons
the Latin
name of dukes , duces , was
very frequent , and
signified , as
among the
Romans , the
commanders
or
leaders of their armies , whom
in their
own language
they called
heperoga (d) ;
and in the laws
of Henry I. (as
translated
by
Lambard )
we find them
called
heretochii
.
But after the Norman
conquest , which
changed
the
military
polity of the
nation ,
our kings ,
themselves
continuing
for
many
generations
dukes of
Normandy , would not honour any subject with the title of
duke , till the time of Edward III.; who , in the eleventh
year of his reign created
his son , Edward the black prince ,
duke of Cornwall
; and many , of the royal family espe-
cially , were afterwards raised to the ducal rank (e). How-
ever, in the reign of queen
Elizabeth
, A.D.
1572 (ƒ) , the
whole
order
of dukes
became extinct
;
though it was
revived by her
successor , who was remarkably
prodigal
of honours ,
in
the
person of
George
Villiers
duke
of
Buckingham
.
2. A marquis , marchio, is in the next degree of nobility .
His office formerly
was (for dignity and duty were never
separated by our
ancestors) to guard the frontiers
and
limits of the kingdom : which
were called the marches ,
from
the
Teutonic
word ,
marche ,
a limit :
such
as , in
particular , were the
marches of Wales
and
Scotland ,
while each of these continued
to be an enemy's country .

France , " in order
to
inflame
the military
ardour
and
ambition
of his earls and
barons ."

EARLS ,
VISCOUNTS ,
AND
BARONS .
481
The persons who had
command
there, were called
lords
marchers , or marquises ; whose authority
was
abolished
by statute 27 Hen. 8, c. 27 : though
the title had long
before become a mere
ensign of honour ;
Robert
Vere ,
earl
of
Oxford ,
being
created
marquis
of Dublin ,
by
Richard II. in the eighth year of his reign (9).
3. An earl has
a title of nobility so ancient , that
its
Earl
origin cannot clearly be traced
out
.
Thus much seems tole-
rably certain
that among the Saxons ealdormen
,
quasi elder
men
,
signified
the
same
as
seniores
or
senatores
among
the Romans
;
and that these dignitaries
were also called
schiremen
,
because
they had each
of
them the civil govern-
ment
of
a
several division
or
shire
.
On the irruption
of
the Danes
,
the name was changed
to
eorles
,
which
,
accord-
ing
to
Camden
(),
signified the same
in
their language
.
In Latin they were called comites
(a
title first used
in
the
empire
)
from
being
the king's
attendants
:
"
a
societate
nomen sumpserunt
,
reges enim tales sibi associant
(i)."
After
the
Norman
conquest
they
were for
some time
called
counts
or
countees
,
from
the French
;
but they did not
long retain that name themselves
,
though their shires are
thence called counties
to
this day
.
The name
of
carls
or
comites
is
now become
a
mere title
,
they having
nothing
to
do with the government
of
the county
;
which
is
de-
volved on the lord lieutenant
,
and on the sheriff
,
the earl's
deputy
,
or
vice
-
comes
(j
).
In
writs
,
commissions
,
and
other formal instruments
,
a
peer
of
the degree
of
an earl
is
usually
styled by the sovereign
"
our trusty and well-
beloved
cousin
:"
an appellation
as
ancient
as
the reign
of
Henry IV
.:
who
being
either by his wife
,
his mother
,
or
his sisters
,
actually
related
or
allied
to
every earl then
in
the
kingdom
,
artfully
and
constantly
acknowledged
that
connection
in
his
letters
and
other
public
acts

THE CIVIL
STATE .
Viscount .
Baron
whence the usage has descended
to his successors
, though
the reason for it has long since failed .
4. The title of rice-comes or viscount was made use of
as
an arbitrary
title of honour , without
any
shadow of
office
pertaining
to it, by
Henry VI.;
who ,
in the
eighteenth
year of his reign , created
John
Beaumont
a
peer, by the title of viscount
Beaumont , which was the
first instance of the kind (k).
5. A baron's
is
the
most
general
title
of nobility ;
originally indeed
every one of the
peers of superior rank
had a barony annexed
to his other titles
( 7) .
But it has
sometimes
happened
that , when
an ancient
baron
has
been raised to a new degree of peerage , in the course of a
few generations the two titles have descended
differently
;
one perhaps to the
male
descendants, the
other to the
heirs general ; whereby the earldom or other superior title
has
subsisted without a barony :
and in modern
times
earls and viscounts have
been
created
without
annexing a
barony to their other honours : so that now the rule
does
not
hold universally , that all
peers
are
barons .
The
origin of baronies
has
occasioned great inquiries
among
our English
antiquaries ,
and cannot with
certainty
be
determined .
It has, however , been surmised , that for
some period after the conquest
every title of nobility was
connected with or attached to land , and that in the reign
of king John , and for some portion of that of his son , the
legislative
assembly
consisted
exclusively
of tenants
in
capite of the crown , and
depended
exclusively
on tenure ;
but it seems fairly presumable that the right by tenure to
be summoned to the house of peers was abandoned in the
ensuing reign of Edward I. , if not expressly abrogated by
law, and that afterwards every peer of the realm was con-
sidered to be entitled
to his dignity as
a personal
right ,
either by express
grant of the crown or by usage, creating
a prescriptive right, in
its
nature personal not territorial

CREATION
OF NOBILITY .
483
Inasmuch
as a writ of summons to parliament
with a sit-
ting created
a barony by writ , it may well be that the right
to sit therein by tenure was gradually
disregarded , and it
is clear that the alienee
of a barony by tenure could sit in
parliament
only when summoned by the crown (n).
•
Peers
are
now
created by writ ,
or by letters patent ,
either independent of or followed by a writ of summons (0) ;
and a peer who claims by prescription
must suppose either
a writ or patent made to his ancestors ; though by length
of time it has been lost .
The creation by writ is a sum-
mons to attend the house of peers , by the style and title
of that barony , which
the sovereign
is
pleased
to confer :
creation
by patent is a royal
grant
to a subject of any
dignity and degree of peerage .
The
creation by writ is
the more ancient way ; but a man is not ennobled thereby ,
unless he actually takes his seat in the house of lords (p) :
and therefore the most
usual
and surest way is to grant
the dignity by patent , which
enures to
a man
and his
heirs according to the limitations
thereof , though he never
himself makes use of it (q ).
It is , however , frequent
to
call up the eldest son of a peer to the
house of lords by
writ of summons , in the name of his father's barony : and
in that case there is no danger of his children's
losing the
nobility in case
he never takes
his
seat : for
they will
succeed
to their
grandfather .
A man
or
woman
may
be ennobled , and
yet the dignity may descend only to
some particular
heirs :
as where a peerage
is limited
to a
man , and the
heirs male of his body by Elizabeth his
present
lady ,
and
not to such
heirs by any former
or
future wife .
It is not , however , as yet
competent to the
crown to grant a life peerage which shall enable
its
holder
to
sit and vote
in
parliament
(r)
;
though
in
this respect
an amplification
of
the prerogative
seems
to
be
imminent
.

THE
CIVIL
STATE .
The inci-
dents of
nobility .
Let us next take a view of some of the principal
inci-
dents
attending
our nobility , exclusive of their
capacity
as members of parliament , and as hereditary counsellors of
the crown ; which we have before considered .
And first
we must
observe , that
for
certain
crimes , viz . , treason ,
felony , or misprision
of either (s) , a nobleman shall be tried
by his peers . The great are especially obnoxious to popular
envy
were they to be judged by the people , they might
be in danger from the prejudice of their judges .
As to
peeresses , there was no precedent for their trial when ac-
cused of treason
or felony , till after Eleanor duchess of
Gloucester ,
wife of the lord protector , was
accused of
treason and found guilty of witchcraft , in an ecclesiastical
synod, through
the intrigues
of cardinal Beaufort .
This
very extraordinary
trial gave occasion
to a special statute ,
20 Hen. 6 , c. 9 , declaring (t) the law to be, that peeresses ,
either in their
own right or by marriage , shall
be tried
before the same judicature
as peers of the realm (u) .
If
a woman , noble in her
own right , marries
a commoner ,
she still remains noble , and shall
be tried by her peers :
but if she be
only noble by marriage , then by a second
marriage with a commoner , she loses her dignity ; for as
by marriage it is gained , by marriage
it is also lost (x) .
Yet if a duchess dowager marries a baron , she continues a
duchess still ; for all the nobility are pares , and therefore
there has
been
no
degradation (y).
The privileges
of
peers
have been elsewhere noticed (~) ; but we may ob-
serve
that their
honour was formerly
so highly tendered
by the law, that it was more penal to spread
false reports
of them and certain other great officers of the realm , than
of other men

account

poverty ,
which
rendered
him
unable

his
dignity (c).
But
this is
a
singular
instance :
which
serves at the same time , by having happened, to show the
power of parliament
;
and by having
happened but once ,
to show how tender the parliament
has been, in exerting
so high a power .
It has been said (d) , indeed , that if a
baron wastes his
estate , so that he is not able to support
the degree, the sovereign may degrade him : but it is now
settled (e ) , that a peer cannot be degraded but by par-
liament (ƒ).

THE
CIVIL
STATE .
by Edward III . , A.D.
1344 (¿) , ranks next
after
the no-
bility .
Next (but not till after certain official dignitaries ,
follows
a knight banneret ; who indeed by statutes 5 Ric . 2 ,
st. 2 , c. 4 , and 14 Ric. 2 , c. 11 , is ranked next to barons ; and
his precedence before the younger
sons of viscounts was
confirmed to him by order of king James I. , in the tenth
year of his reign (k) .
But that he may be entitled to this
rank, he must
have
been
created by the sovereign in
person , in the
field , under the royal
banners , in time of
open war (7) .
Else he ranks after baronets ; who are the
next in order ; the baronetage being a dignity of inheri-
tance, created by letters
patent , and usually
descendible
to the issue male . It was first instituted by king James I. ,
A.D.
1611 ; in order to raise a competent sum for the re-
duction of the
province of Ulster in
Ireland
; for which
reason every baronet has the arms of Ulster superadded to
his family coat.
Next follow knights of the bath ; an
order
instituted
by king Henry IV. and revived by king
George I.
They
are
so
called
from the
ceremony of
bathing the night before their creation .
The last of these
inferior nobility are knights bachelors ; the most ancient ,
though
the lowest
order of knighthood
amongst us ; for
we have an instance (m) of king Alfred's
conferring
this
order on his son Athelstan .
The
custom of the
ancient
Germans was to give their young men a shield and a lance
in the great council : this was equivalent to the toga virilis
of the Romans
: before this
they were not
permitted
to
bear arms ,
but
were
accounted
as part of the father's
household ; after it, as part of the community
(n).
Hence
some derive the usage of knighting, which has prevailed
all over the western world , since its reduction by colonies.
from those northern

As for gentlemen ,
says
sir
Thomas

be
made good cheap in this kingdom
: for whosoever studieth
the laws of the realm , who
studieth in the universities
,
who

can live idly , and without manual
labour , and will bear
the port ,

he
shall be called master , and shall be taken for a gentleman .
A yeoman is one having
free land of forty shillings by
the year ; who was anciently
thereby qualified to serve on
juries, vote for knights of the shire , and do any other act,
for which
the law requires one who is probus

CHAPTER XIII .
THE
MILITARY
AND
MARITIME
STATES .
state.
THE military state will here be taken to include all such Military
persons as are peculiarly
appointed
for the safeguard and
defence of the realm , by service upon land.
Our laws and constitution
did not originally
know any
such state as that of a perpetual standing soldier , bred up
to no other profession
than that of war (a) : and it was Yeomen of
not till the reign of Henry VII. that the kings of England
had so much as a guard about their persons.
the guard.
Saxon
force.
In the time of our Saxon
ancestors, the military force on the
of this kingdom was in the hands of the dukes or here- military
tochs , who were constituted
through
every province
and
county in the kingdom
; and were taken out of the prin-
cipal nobility .
Their duty
was to lead and regulate
the
English
armies , with
a very unlimited
power .
And
be-
cause of this great power they were elected by the people
in their full assembly , or folkmote , following
still that old
fundamental
maxim of the Saxon constitution , that where
any
officer was
intrusted
with such power , as if abused
might tend to the
oppression of the people , that
power
(a) Regular
troops , however , of
some
sort
must
have
been main-
tained
in
those
fortified
places ,
where
some
show
of defence
has
been always kept up ; as the Tower
of London , Portsmouth
, the castle
of Dover , the fort of Tilbury , and ,
before the union
of the
Crowns ,
Berwick and
some other
places on
the Scottish
border .
Little
is now
known
as to the
nature
of these
garrisons
;
except that they were
chiefly
accustomed
to the
use of
artillery,
and
that
their
whole
number
was insignificant
, and pro-
bably at no time equal to resist any
serious attack .


492
THE MILITARY
AND
MARITIME
STATES .
The military
part of the
feudal
system.
was delegated to him by
a vote of the
people
them-
selves (b) .
So , too, the
ancient
Germans , the ancestors
of our Saxon forefathers , had their dukes as well as kings ,
with an independent power over the military , as the kings
had
over the civil state.
The
dukes
were
elective , the
kings hereditary
: or in the words of Tacitus (e) " reges ex
nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumunt;" in constituting
their
kings , the family or blood -royal was regarded , in choosing
their dukes or leaders , warlike
merit : just as Cæsar relates
of their ancestors in his time , that whenever they went to
war, by
way
either of attack
or
defence , they
elected
leaders to command them (d).
The
large share of power ,
thus conferred by the people , though intended to preserve
the liberty of the
subject , was perhaps
unreasonably
de-
trimental
to the prerogative of the crown ; and we find
a
very
ill
use made
of
it
by Edric
,
duke
of
Mercia
,
in
the
reign
of
king Edmund
Ironside
,
who
,
by his office
of
duke
or
heretoch
,
was entitled
to
a
large command
in
the king's
army
,
and by his
repeated
treacheries
at
last transferred
the crown to Canute the Dane
.
King Alfred
is
by some thought
first
to
have settled
a
national
militia
in
this kingdom
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
by his
prudent discipline
to
have made all the subjects
of
his do-
minion
soldiers
;
but we are unfortunately
left
in
the dark
as
to
the particulars
of
this his
so
celebrated regulation
;
though
,
from what was last observed
,
the dukes seem
to
have been left
in
possession
of
too large and independent
a
power
;
which enabled duke Harold
,
on the death
of
Edward the Confessor
,
though
a
stranger
to
the royal blood
,
to
mount
,
for
a
short space
,
the throne
of
this kingdom
,
in
prejudice
of
Edgar Atheling
,
the rightful heir
.
Upon the Norman
conquest
,
the feudal law was intro-
duced here

all its rigour

up on
a military plan . I shall
not now enter into the
particulars
of that
constitution
,
which
belongs
more
properly to the
next
volume of our
Commentaries
; but
shall
only
observe , that in
consequence
thereof
all the
lands in the kingdom
were divided
into what were called
knight's
fees , in number
above
sixty thousand
; and for
every knight's fee a knight or soldier , miles, was bound
to attend the king in his wars , for forty days in a year ; in
which
space of time the campaign was generally finished ,
and a kingdom
either conquered or victorious .
By this
means the king had , without
any expense , an army of sixty
thousand
men
always
ready at his command .
And
ac-
cordingly
we find a
special
clause (e) in the charter of
William the Conqueror , which
in the king's name com-
mands
and firmly enjoins
the personal
attendance of all
knights and others ; " quod habeant
et
teneant
se semper
in armis
et equis , ut decet et oportet :
et quod
semper
sint
prompti et parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis explen-
dum
et peragendum,
cum
opus
adfuerit ,
secundum
quod
debent de feodis
et
tenementis
suis
de jure
nobis facere .”
This personal
service
was , in the reign
of
Henry II. ,
first allowed to be commuted into a pecuniary payment ,
and military tenures
were abolished by 12 Car . 2 , c. 24 .

In the
mean
time
we are not
to
imagine
that the
kingdom
was
left
wholly
without
defence

case
of
domestic
insurrections , or
the
prospect
of
foreign
invasion .

obliged every man , according to his
estate
and degree , to
provide a determinate quantity of such arms as were then
in use, in order to keep the
peace ; and constables were
appointed in all hundreds
by the latter
statute
to
see
that
such
arms
were provided .
These weapons

changed by the
statute 4 & 5 Ph. & M. c. 2 , into
others
of more modern
service ; but both this and the former
provisions
were repealed in the reign of James I. ( ) .
While they continued in force, however , it was usual from
time to time for our
princes
to issue
commissions
of
array , and
send into every county officers in whom they
could
confide to muster
and
array
(or set in military
order) the inhabitants
of every district ; and the form of
the commission of array was settled in parliament
in the
5 Hen. 4 , so as to prevent the insertion therein of any new
penal
clauses (2) .
But it was
also provided (k) that
no
man should be compelled to go out of the kingdom
at any
rate , nor out of his shire but in cases of urgent necessity ;
nor
should
provide
soldiers
unless by consent of parlia-
ment .
About the
reign
of king Henry VIII . ,
or
his
children , lieutenants began to be introduced
(1) , as stand-
ing representatives of the crown , to keep the counties in
military order ;
for we find them mentioned
as known
officers in the statute 4 &
5 Ph . & M.
c. 3 , though
they
do
not
seem
to have been then
universal , for Camden
speaks of them ( m ) in the time of queen
Elizabeth
,
as

The
former
of these enactments was in-
tended to put a stop to the procla-
mations , which,
especially
in the
reigns
of
Edw. I.
and
Edw. II.
(Rym. Foed. passim ), had been issued
to the sheriffs , directing
them to
notify to all persons
of sufficient
estate that they
must
hold them-
selves
ready
to
attend
the
king
whenever
he
should
require
their
service .
These
arbitrary
conscrip-
tions
being
thus
checked
by
the
parliament ,
Edw. III .
had
re-
course to another
mode of levying
soldiers , without his own
cost, by
calling on every
county
and prin-
cipal town to furnish
a
specified
number
of troops .
Against this,
the
parliament
provided
a remedy
in the latter of the
above -cited sta-
tutes , which
enacts, " that no man
shall be constrained
to find
men at
arms ,
hoblers , nor
archers ,
other
than those
who
hold by such
ser-
vice , if it be not by common
con-
sent
and
grant
in
parliament
."
Both these statutes were recited and
confirmed by 4 Hen. 4, c. 13.

which

it

THE MILITARY

STATES .
The present
militia laws.
Yeomanry.
militia now
stands by law is principally built upon the
statutes which
were
then
enacted.
It is true
that
each
of these statutes has , for the most part , been
repealed ;
but many of their provisions
have , with the
addition of
some new regulations , been re -enacted .
The
present
militia
system is
mainly
regulated
by
42 Geo. 3 , c. 90 , as altered
and amended by many
sub-
sequent acts, the last of which
is
32
& 33 Vict.
c . 13 .
The general scheme of the legislature
has been
to disci-
pline a certain number of the inhabitants of every
county ,
chosen by lot for five years (q ) ; and officered by the lord
lieutenant , the
deputy
lieutenants ,
and
other principal
landholders , under a commission
from the crown .
They
are not compellable to march out of their counties , unless
in case of invasion
or actual rebellion within the realm
(or any of its
dominions
or territories
(r) ) , nor in any
case compellable to march out of the kingdom .
They
are
to be exercised at stated times ; and their discipline in
general is liberal and easy ; though , when called out into
actual
service , they
are
subject
to the rigour of martial
law ,
as necessary to
keep them in order .
This is the
constitutional
security
which
our laws
provided
for the
public
peace , and for protecting
the realm against foreign
or domestic violence .
In addition
to the militia , large
bodies of troops were
organized
during
the
French
war in
the
reign
of
George III. , consisting principally of voluntary
infantry ,
called volunteers , and partly of voluntary
cavalry , called
yeomanry (s).
These troops consisted entirely of persons
serving
voluntarily, and as they were not called on to
leave their homes , or to serve except for short periods for
the purpose of being drilled
near their places of residence,
(2) The
militia is now raised by
voluntary
enlistment , and the power
of enrolling by ballot has not been
exercised
for many
years , having
been suspended
from
time
to time
by various
acts, from 10

the service was not found
burdensome , and the country
had the advantage of having ready in case of invasion , a
considerable
number of men trained to arms .
Soon after
the conclusion of peace , most if not all of these volunteers
were disbanded , but various troops of yeomanry
are still
kept
up .
They

scarcely
any voluntary
troops in England, but towards
the end of the year 1859 large
numbers of men enrolled
themselves in volunteer rifle corps, and some in volunteer
corps of artillery, engineers , and cavalry .
These troops ,
having
increased
up to the
present
time , now
number
about
two hundred
thousand
men .
The volunteers
are
regulated by the stat. 26 & 27 Vict . c. 65.
They are
not
obliged to leave the kingdom
; they may quit their corps ,
when
not
on active military
service , on giving fourteen
days ' notice , and are only liable
to be called out in case of
actual or apprehended invasion .
When on active military

troops.
To return to our
former
system , when the
nation was The regular
engaged in war , more veteran troops and
more regular
discipline
were esteemed
to be
necessary , than
could be
expected from a mere militia .
And
therefore
at such
times
more rigorous
methods
were put in use for the
raising of armies , and the due regulation
and discipline of
the soldiery
but such methods were looked upon only as
temporary
excrescences
bred out of the
distemper of the
state , and not as any part of the permanent and perpetual
laws of the kingdom .
We find it indeed laid
down (t) ,
that if a lieutenant , or other having commission of martial
authority ,
should
in
time
of
peace
hang
or
otherwise
execute any man by colour of martial law, this is murder ,

subject without his

And whereas , after the
Restoration , king
Charles II. kept up about five thousand
regular
troops ,
by his own authority , for guards
and garrisons
; which
king James II. by degrees
increased to no less than thirty
thousand , all paid
from his own civil list ; it was made
one of the articles of the bill of rights (y) , that the raising
or keeping
a standing
army within the kingdom
in time
of peace , unless with the consent of parliament , is against
law.
But as the fashion of keeping
standing
armies (which
was introduced by Charles VII. in France , A.D.
1445 (x) )
has long prevailed
in Europe , it has also for many years
past been
annually
judged
necessary by our legislature ,
for the safety of the kingdom , the defence
of the posses-
sions of the crown of Great Britain , and the preservation
of the balance of power , to maintain
even in time of peace
a standing
body of troops , under
the command
of the
Mutiny Act. crown .
An act of parliament
is therefore annually passed ,
for the purpose of allowing
the maintenance of a body of
troops , whose number is specified therein , and who
are
ipso facto disbanded at the expiration of every year , unless
continued by parliament .
This annual statute , called the
Mutiny Act (a) , has
been
now
passed
for many
years ,
with very slight alterations , except as regards the number
of the troops to be maintained .

statute , after reciting
that the raising or keeping

Although
soldiers
are placed under

severer restrictions than
most
other subjects of the

enjoy some peculiar
advantages
, among
which may be mentioned pensions allowed for the relief of
soldiers who are sick , hurt, and maimed : not forgetting
the royal hospital
at Chelsea , for such as are worn out in
their
duty .

the law requires
in other
cases (e) .
Our law
does
not
indeed extend this privilege
so far as did the Roman law ;
which carried it to an extreme bordering
on the ridicu-
lous .
For if a soldier , at the point of death , wrote any-
thing in bloody letters on his shield , or in the dust of the
field with the
sword, it was a very good military testa-
ment (f).
And
thus
much

acknowledged by the laws of England (g) .
The maritime
is nearly
related
to the military
state.
The

navy of England has
ever
been its greatest
defence
and
ornament ;
it is its
ancient
and
natural
strength ; the
floating
bulwark of the
island
; an arm ,
moreover , from which , however
strong and
powerful , no
danger can ever be apprehended
to liberty
and accord-
ingly it has been
assiduously
cultivated , even
from
the
earliest ages .
To so much perfection
had our naval repu-
tation
attained in the twelfth
century , that the
code
of
maritime
laws , which
are called the laws of Oleron , and
are received by European nations
as the ground
and sub-
struction of their marine
constitutions , was confessedly
compiled by our king Richard I. , at the isle of Oleron , on
the coast of France , then part of the
possessions
of the
crown of England ( ).
And yet , so vastly
inferior
were
our ancestors in this point
to the present age , that even

the crown has been
a matter
of some dispute ,
and
sub-
mitted to with great reluctance ; but it has clearly
and
learnedly
been shown by sir Michael
Foster (k) , that the
practice of impressing
and granting
powers to the admi-
ralty for that purpose
is of very ancient
date , and
has
been uniformly
continued by a regular
series of prece-
dents to the present time ; whence he concludes it to be
part of the common law (1) .
The difficulty
once felt upon
this
subject
arose
doubtless partly from the fact that no
statute
has expressly
declared this power
to be in the
crown , though many of them very
strongly imply it (m) .
And , by other
statutes too
numerous to be mentioned ,
especial protections have been allowed to seamen in parti-
cular
circumstances
to prevent their being
liable to im-
pressment .
Irrespective of this method of impressing (which is only
defensible on the ground of public necessity , to which all
private
considerations
must give way), the navy is sup-
plied by voluntary
enlistment ,
and, by 22
& 23 Vict .
c. 40 , a useful force has been constituted called the royal
naval reserve.

days' training in

are liable
in times of
necessity to serve for three years on being
called on to do
so by royal
proclamation , which
period may be extended
to two years more.
The proclamation
calling
them forth
must
be communicated to parliament if sitting , and de-
clared in council if parliament
be not sitting . Further, by
26 & 27 Vict. c. 69 , masters and mates in the merchant
service may be accepted
as officers in the naval reserve .
Articles of
The method of ordering
seamen
in the royal
fleet , and
keeping up a regular discipline
there , is directed
by cer-
tain express rules and articles , first enacted
by the autho-
rity of parliament
soon
after the
Restoration ( n ) :
but
since new modelled
and altered by various
statutes , the
last of which at present governing
our navy is the 29 & 30
Vict . c . 109.
The provisions of this statute are in many
respects
similar
to those of the Mutiny Act , though a dis-
tinction
must here be noticed-that whereas
the
acts
for
the government
of the army
have
been
annual ,
those
regulating the navy have not been
so limited
in duration .
Whence
this distinction
arose , it might be hard to assign
a reason : unless it proceeded
from the
establishment
of
the navy being
perpetual , which
rendered
a permanent
law
for
its
regulation
expedient ;
and the
temporary
duration of the army , which
subsisted
only from
year to
year.
But whatever was apprehended at the first enact-
ing of a mutiny
act, the
regular
renewal of our stand-
ing force at the
entrance of
every
year
has made this
distinction
idle .
For , if from
experience past
we
may
judge of future events , the army is now lastingly ingrafted
into the British constitution
;
subject,
however , to this
condition , that any branch of the legislature
may annually
put an end to its legal
existence , by refusing to concur in
its continuance .

conferred on sailors are nearly the same

as those conferred on soldiers ; with regard to relief when
maimed , wounded , or superannuated , either by pensions ,
or by admission into the royal hospital
at Greenwich (0) ;
and
with
regard
to the power
of making
nuncupative
testaments (p).
Moreover no seaman under the rank of a
commissioned
officer
can be arrested for
a debt unless
it was contracted before he entered
the naval service (q) .
Besides soldiers and sailors , there is in the pay of the Royal
crown a body of forces named the royal
marines , who are
principally intended
for service on board
ship ,
though
they do duty
likewise
on land .
These troops
when on
board vessels of the royal navy are , like sailors , under the
provisions of the Naval Discipline
Act ; but when doing
duty on land , in merchant
vessels , or in any situation
in
which they do not come within the provisions of that act,
they are regulated by a statute similar to the mutiny act ,
which is passed annually ,
and entitled " An act for the
regulation
of her
Majesty's
royal marine
forces while on
shore " ( ) .
This act gives to marines the same protection
from arrest that soldiers enjoy (s).
We
have
seen
that , by various
enactments , persons
belonging to the army , navy , and royal marines are placed
under a stricter discipline
and more stringent
regulations
than
other subjects of the crown , and the military law
which governs them
is often , though
incorrectly , spoken
of as martial law .

however , is
sometimes

time (t) .
It is in reference to martial
law taken in this
latter
sense , and
supposed to be built upon no settled
principles , but entirely arbitrary in its decisions , that sir
Matthew
Hale ( u)
observed
, " in truth and reality it is
not a law, but something
indulged
rather than allowed as
a law " (x).
He goes
on , also, to say , that its only excuse
is the necessity of discipline
in the army (y) ,
and that
therefore it was only to extend to members of our own
or of the enemy's army , and was never to be exercised in
time of peace when the courts were open (z).
It would
seem , in spite of opinions
to the contrary , that martial
law, thus
understood , cannot
exist in England (a) ; if,
however , its
exercise
here were
ever
lawful ,
necessity
alone could justify it (b) .

of Wellington
is reported
to
have
said
in

that martial law

more nor
less than the

that in fact martial law
meant
no

MASTER
AND
SERVANT .
HAVING
thus
commented
on the rights
and duties of
persons as
standing in the public relations of magistrates
and people , the method originally marked
out now leads
us to consider
their rights and duties in private
econo-
mical relations .
duties asto
private life.
The four great relations in private life are ,
1st , That of Rights and
master
and servant :
which
is
founded
in convenience , relations in
whereby
a man is directed to call in the
assistance
of
others , where his own skill and labour will not be suffi-
cient to answer the cares incumbent upon him (a) .
2ndly ,
That of husband
and wife : which is founded in nature ,
but modified by civil society : the one directing
man to
continue
and multiply his species , the other prescribing
the manner in which
that natural
impulse
must
be con-
fined
and regulated .
3rdly ,
That of parent and child
:
which is consequent on marriage , being its principal
end
and design .
It is by virtue of this relation
that
infants
are
protected , maintained , and
educated ;
though
since
the parents , on whom
such care
is primarily incumbent ,
may be snatched away by death before they have com-
pleted their duty , the law has provided
another relation ,
viz ., that of guardian
and ward ; which
is a kind of arti-
ficial parentage , in
order to supply the deficiency , when-
ever it
happens ,
of the
natural .
To
the
relation
of
guardian
and ward
allusion will occasionally be made in
ensuingvolumes , the three other relations mentioned shall
here be treated of in order.

J. The se-
veral sorts
Slavery.
In discussing
the relation
of master
and
servant , we
shall
consider , I. , the several sorts of servants , and how
this
relation
is created
and destroyed ; II. , the
incidents
of service and the effect of this relation with regard to the
parties
themselves ; and , III . , its
effects
with regard to
other persons .
I. As to the several sorts of servants ; it has been for-
of servants. merly observed (b) that pure and proper slavery does not ,
nay cannot , subsist in England ; that is , such whereby an
absolute and unlimited
power is given to the master over
the life and fortune of the slave.
And indeed it is repug-
nant
to reason, and the principles
of natural
law ,
that
such a state should subsist anywhere .
The
three
origins
of the right of
slavery ,
assigned
by Justinian
(c) ,
are
all of them built upon false foundations (d) .
As ,
first ,
slavery is said to arise " jure gentium," from a state of
captivity in war ; whence slaves
are called mancipia , quasi
manu capti .
The conqueror , say the civilians , had a right
to the life of his captive , and , having
spared
that , has a
right to deal with him as he pleases .
But it is an untrue
position , when taken generally , that by the law of nature
or nations a man may kill his enemy ; he has only a right
to kill him in particular
cases ; in cases of absolute neces-
sity , for self -defence
; and it is plain
this absolute neces-
sity could not have subsisted , where a person was reduced
to the
condition
of a slave,
since the
capturing
victor
did not actually kill him , but made him prisoner .
indeed , gives no other right over a prisoner , than merely
to disable
him
from
doing
us harm , by confining
his
person ; it does
not give a right to kill , torture , abuse,
plunder , or even enslave an enemy, when the war is over .
Since , therefore , the right of making
slaves
by captivity

depends on a supposed right of slaughter , that foundation
failing , the consequence
drawn from it must fail
likewise .
But , secondly , it is said that
slavery may begin "jure
civili ," when one man sells himself to another .
This , if
only meant of contracts to serve or work for another , is
very just
but when applied to strict slavery , in the sense
of the laws of ancient Rome , is also incorrect .
Every
sale
implies
a price , a quid pro quo , an equivalent
given
to
the seller in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer : but
what equivalent can be given for life and liberty , both of
which (in absolute slavery ) are held
to be in the master's
disposal ?
The
seller's
property
also , the very price
he
seems
to receive,
devolves
ipso facto
to his
master the
instant he becomes
his slave .
In this case , therefore , the
buyer
gives nothing , and the seller
receives
nothing
; of
what validity
then can a sale be, which
destroys
the very
principles
upon which all
sales
are founded ?
Lastly, we
are told , that
besides these two ways by which
slaves
"fiunt," or are required , they
may also
be hereditary
;
" servi nascuntur ; " the
children
of acquired
slaves
are
iure natura, by a negative kind of birthright , slaves
also.
But this, being
built on the two former
rights ,
must
fall together
with them . If neither
captivity ,
nor
the
sale of one's
self,
can by the law of nature and reason
reduce the parent
to slavery , much
less
can they reduce
the offspring .
Upon these principles
the law of England abhors ,
and
will
not
endure
the
existence
of,
slavery
within this
nation ;
so that when an attempt was made to introduce
it by statute
1 Edw . VI. c. 3 , which ordained that all idle
vagabonds
should
be
marked
on the
breast with a hot
iron , should be made slaves , and fed upon bread, water , or
small drink , and refuse meat ; should wear a ring of iron
round their necks , arms , or legs ; and should be compelled
by beating , chaining , or otherwise , to perform
the work
assigned them , were it never
so vile ; the spirit of the
nation
could
not
brook
this
condition
even in the most

abandoned rogues ;
and
therefore
this
statute
was two
years afterwards repealed (e).
And it is settled (f) , that
a slave,
the instant
he lands in England , becomes
thus
far
a freeman ;
that
our
law will
protect
him
in
the
enjoyment of his person and his property .
Yet , as there must always be different ranks in society ,
and as the poor must always have recourse to labour
as a
means of obtaining
subsistence , the law recognises a state
of servitude
founded
on
contract
to
be
lawful .
The
duration of this contract must be regulated by the parties
themselves , and
however
strictly
the law may interpret ,
and however jealously
it may look
upon , a contract to
serve for life , there is no reason for saying that it is neces-
sarily illegal (g) , at any rate, if it be entered into by one
who is suijuris at the time (h).
1. The first sort of servants which we shall
mention
as
acknowledged
by
the
laws
of
England ,
are
menial
servants ;
so
called
from
their
being
intra
mænia ,
or
domestics ;
a
definition
which
applies
to
gardeners ,
grooms , and others ( ) , if they reside within the curtilage
or domain
of their master , though
not
actually
in his
house.
The
contract
between
a menial
servant and his
master
arises upon the hiring ,
and may be
either ex-
pressed
in terms , or implied by custom ( ) . If the hiring
be general without
any particular
time either expressly or
impliedly
(k) limited , the law construes it to be a hiring
for a year (1) , subject however by custom to the
condition
that it may be determined
by either
party , on giving a
month's
notice
or
paying
a month's
wages
(m).

MENIAL SERVANTS .

custom
however
is strictly confined to menial
servants ,
and does not apply to those occupying
a superior position ,
such
as that of governess (n) ,
clerk (0) ,
or warehouse-
man (p) ; nor to those whose situation
is not
domestic ,
such as a labourer in husbandry , or a farm bailiff ( q) .
A
menial servant is however not exempted from
the general
rule of being liable
to discharge
at any moment for mis-
conduct
or disobedience of lawful
orders
;
and in such
case he is not entitled to a month's wages (r) , nor can he
claim
payment
for the time during
which
he may have
actually
served , if thus
dismissed
before the
period
for
which he was originally
hired ( s) , and at a time when no
wages were actually due (†).
Although the servant
has no right to a character (u),
yet , if the
master
assume to give
the
character of
a
servant , he must
give it
bonâ fide ; for he who gives
a
false
character , charging
the servant with faults without
just cause , and with
a malicious
design to injure
him , is
liable to an action (x) ; proof of malice is, however , neces-
sary to support such action , though
where the character
given
is
false , slight
circumstances
may suffice as evi-
dence of it (y) .
It is clear however that the master owes
a duty to a person about to engage a late servant , which
compels him to make full and true , if he make any , answer

there is no proof of malice , such communication

2. An apprentice (from apprendre , to learn , ) is usually
bound for a term of years , by deed
indented , or inden-
ture ,
to serve his
master , and to
be
maintained
and
instructed by him .
This is usually done to a person in
trade , in order that the apprentice
may learn a business ;
and sometimes
a large sum is given with him , as a pre-
mium for instruction .
Though
an apprentice is generally
bound by his father or friend , yet the binding is not valid ,
unless he personally execute
the indenture (b) , though the
contract of apprenticeship
may
be entered into by an
infant, as the
law considers it to be for his benefit (c).
To the
above
rule
as to consent there is an exception in
the case
of a child whose parents are unable to maintain
him
(d) ; for such a child may be apprenticed without
his
own
consent (e), by the
overseers (f) in
a parish
not
included in a union , and by the guardians (g) of the poor
in one which
is
so included ; in the former
case the con-
sent of two justices
being
necessary

not so in
the latter (i).
The justices were formerly
sole judges of
the persons to whom parish apprentices should be bound ,
and these persons were obliged to receive them (k) , but it

has
since
been
enacted
that no one can be compelled to
take an apprentice against
his will (/) .
The contract of apprenticeship may (provided the inden-
tures be cancelled (m) ) , be determined
by consent of the
parties to it, though if the apprentice be an infant at the
time , it is necessary that the determination
be for his bene-
fit
(n).
Such
a
contract
is
also determined
by the bank-
ruptcy
of
the master
(o),
or
his death
(p
)
(
unless there
be
a
covenant for continuing
the service with his executors

by the death
of
the apprentice

of
the peace

moreover
,
and courts

exercise that trade in any part of England (a) .
This law
as regards the
exclusive
part of it, was by turns looked
upon as a hard law , or as a beneficial
one , according to the
prevailing humour of the times :
which occasioned many
resolutions
in the courts of law concerning it ; however,
these resolutions in general rather confined than extended
the restriction .
No
trades
were
held
to be within the
statute ,
but
such
as were in
being
at the
making of
it (b) :
for trading
in
a country
village , apprenticeships
were said to be not requisite (c) ;
and following
the trade
seven years , without
any effectual prosecution
(either as a
master or a servant ) , was held sufficient without
an actual
apprenticeship
(d ) .
At last the restrictions
thus
imposed on trade were re-
pealed by 54 Geo. 3 , c. 96 ; and afterwards by sect . 14 of
the Municipal Corporation
Reform Act (5 & 6 Wm . 4, c.
76),
exclusive
rights of trading in boroughs , &c. were
also
abolished .
But these
acts do not extend to the city
of London , where several customs and bye-laws , excluding
other
than
freemen
from
trading
within the
city , still
exist.
A master
may by law correct his
apprentice for negli-
gence or other misbehaviour
(e) , provided it be done with
moderation (f) :
though if a master
or
master's
wife
beats any other servant of full
age , it is good
cause
of
departure (g).
A master is obliged to find medical attendance for his
apprentice (h) , though not for his menial servant ( ) ; yet

so
taken
,
must be included
the chance
of
sustaining
injury
from the negligence
of
such
of

as
are

THE
INCIDENTS
OF SERVICE .
515
By several statutes (s) justices of the
peace
have had
jurisdiction given
them over labourers
and artificers , in-
cluding
servants
in
husbandry ,
though
not
menial
servants (t),
and
could
formerly
enforce
payment
of
wages
as against
an employer , and discharge the servant
from employment
on
non -fulfilment by the
master of
his contract .
The justices
could only summon the master
to appear before them , but if it was alleged that the ser-
vant
had
been
guilty of misconduct , or had unlawfully
absented himself from
work,
they
might ,
without
any
notice , issue a warrant
for his immediate
apprehension ,
and , on the offence being duly proved , commit him to hard
labour
for any
period not exceeding three months .
The
harshness of our law in thus
dealing
with the
servant
has been partly remedied by the statute 30 & 31 Vict . , c .
141 ,
which
enacts
that
the
proceedings
against
the
servant , as well as against the master , shall commence by
summons , that compensation
or a fine
shall
be awarded
in the first instance , that imprisonment
in lieu thereof
shall
be a total
discharge of compensation , and that no
subsequently
accruing wages shall be appropriated to pay
it.
The previous
pnnishment
of imprisonment
for three
months , without
the option of a fine , can now only be in-
flicted in cases of aggravated misconduct .
The provisions of our criminal
law relating to combina-
tions amongst workmen being elsewhere considered (u) , we
shall
here merely
observe
that , no workman
seems to be
punishable for joining in a strike
so long as it is conducted
peaceably,
and
no
subsisting
contract
of
service is

III. How
third parties
violated .
The fact , however , of combinations
of this sort
not being illegal in the sense of being punishable
by law ,
does not render them so far legal as to prevent the courts
from refusing to enforce an agreement made in pursuance
of
such combination
as being
in restraint
of trade and
therefore void (x) .
To a servant , other than
an apprentice , wages become
due
according
to
the
agreement , either
express
or
implied (y), under which he
serves , and slight evidence
would suffice to entitle the servant to recover on a quantum
meruit whatever
a jury might think his
services
to be
fairly worth (2). A contract to pay wages is not , however ,
necessarily inferred from a contract of service , as board and
lodging, either with (a ) or without (b) instruction , may be
a sufficient
remuneration
for it.
A restriction , however ,
is imposed
on the power of master
and servant to agree
as to the terms
of
service, by the truck act (c), which
prohibits
various
work
people
therein
enumerated (d)
from receiving wages otherwise than in the current coin of
the realm .
This act, however, does not extend to domestic
servants , nor to servants in husbandry (e).
III. Let us , lastly , see how strangers
may be affected

or how a master

tion of
may behave towards others on behalf of his servant ; and
what a servant may do on behalf of his master .

in
general , it
is
an offence
against
public
justice
to
encourage suits
and animosities ,
by helping to bear the
expense of them , and is called in law maintenance (ƒ) .
A master also may bring
an action against
any man for
beating or seducing his servant (g) : but in each such case
he must
assign , as a special reason for so doing , his own
damage by the loss
of
service ; and this loss
must be
proved upon the trial ( ) ; and , when proved , the jury may
give damages
for the loss sustained , not only to the time
of
action
brought , but down to the
time
when ,
as it
appears by evidence, the servant may be
expected
to re-
cover ability to perform his duties () .
A master likewise
may justify
an assault
in
defence
of his
servant , and a
servant in defence of his master (k) : the master , because
he has an interest in his servant , not to be deprived of his
service
;
the
servant ,
because
it is part of his
duty , for
which
he
receives
his
wages , to
stand by and defend his
master (1).
If any
person knowingly
entices
away
a servant
or
apprentice (m), or
retains
him in his service
after
due
notice
that
he is
under
an
unexpired
contract
of
ser-
vice (n) , he is , in either
case , liable
to an action
at suit
of the master .
Indeed , it would
seem that
the master
may, in this case , maintain
an action for damages
as well
against
the
servant
as against his new master , though if
the latter was unaware of the former
service , he
is not
liable unless he afterwards
refuse to restore the servant
upon information
and demand (o) .
Moreover , the master

may, if he choose , waive the tort , and bring his action for
whatever the servant has
earned
while unlawfully in the
service of another ( p ) .
It is not , however , actionable
to
persuade
a
servant to leave his
master , or enter into a
new service
after
the expiration
of the term for which he
has contracted (q) .
The
foundation
upon which
all this
doctrine is built , seems to be that every man has a right
to the service of his domestics ; acquired by the contract
of hiring , and purchased by giving them wages .
As for those things
which a servant may do on behalf
of his master , they seem all to proceed upon the general
principle of agency, by which the master is answerable for
the act of his
servant , if done by his command , either
expressly given or implied
:
nam , qui facit per alium , facit
per se (r).
Therefore , if the
servant
commit
a trespass
by the command
or encouragement
of his
master , the
master shall be guilty of it (s) , though
the servant is not
thereby
excused , for he is
only
to obey his master
in
matters that are honest and lawful (t) . If an innkeeper's
servant
rob
his
guests,
or
a
carrier's
servant
steal the
goods entrusted to his master ; in either
case the master
is
bound to restitution

reposed
in him, that he will take care to provide
honest.
servants , his
negligence
is
a kind of implied
consent
to
the robbery ; nam, qui non prohibet , quod prohibere potest,
assentire videtur (x).
Formerly , indeed , innkeepers
(ex-
cept for loss , to which the gross carelessness
of their guests
had contributed ,) and common
carriers were looked upon
as
insurers
of the goods
entrusted
to their
care ;

though they have both
been , to a certain
extent , relieved
from this liability by statute , yet in such case , it is ex-
pressly provided
that this relief shall not extend to rob-
beries committed
by their own servants (y) .
So, likewise ,
if the drawer at a tavern
sells a man bad wine , whereby
his health is injured , he may bring
an action against the
master (z) : for
although
the
master
did
not
expressly
order the servant to sell it to that person in particular ,
yet his permitting
him to draw and sell it at all amounts
impliedly to a general command .
Though in the
above
and many other
cases the master
is civilly liable for the act of his servant , yet in general he
is not criminally responsible for it (a).
This rule , however ,
is open to exceptions , and in some
peculiar circumstances
a master has been held even
criminally liable
for the acts
of his
servant , though
done without
his knowledge , and
even against
his
express
command , as for
an infringe-
ment of the revenue laws (b), or a public nuisance (c) , and
before the statute 6 & 7 Vict . c. 96 , s . 7 , the proprietor of
a newspaper might have been indicted for a libel published
in it by his servant without
his authority
or sanction (d) .
In like manner , whatever a servant is permitted to do
in the
usual
course of his business , is impliedly done in
virtue of a general command . If I pay money to a banker's
servant , or to a shopman over the counter (e) ; the banker
or shopkeeper is answerable for it : if I pay it to a clergy-
man's
or
a physician's
servant , whose usual
business is
not to receive
money for his master , and he embezzles it ,
I might have to pay it over
again .

ledge , and
even
against
his orders , the owner is
bound
;
for this
transaction
comes
within the
business
of the
servant of a horsedealer (f) ; but if a huntsman , game-
keeper, or butler
affected
to let a farm, or the servant of a
private gentleman
to warrant
a horse , in these
cases the
master would
not be bound if he did
not authorise the
sale , or if he forbade the warranty (g) .
Persons who are usually
employed to transact business
for a man , are quoad hoc his servants , and the principal
must
answer for their
conduct ; for the law implies that
they act under a general
command ; and without
such a
doctrine
as this
no mutual intercourse
between man and
man could
subsist with any tolerable convenience. If I
usually
deal with a tradesman
by myself, or
constantly
pay him ready money , I am not answerable for what my
servant buys upon credit
; for here is no implied order to
the tradesman to trust my servant : but if I usually send
him
upon
trust, or sometimes
on trust and
sometimes
with ready money , I am answerable for all he buys ; for
the tradesman cannot possibly distinguish
when he comes
by my order , and when upon his own authority (h).
Further , although
a master
is not liable for the wilful
trespass of his
servant , unless
done
by his
command ,
express or implied (?) , yet if a servant , by his negligence ,
does any damage to a stranger , the master may have to
answer for his neglect ; thus , if a smith's
servant lames a
horse while
he is shoeing him, or a carrier's servant loses
a parcel , in each of these cases
an action lies against the
master (k) .
But in any of these
cases the damage must

be done while
the
servant is
actually
employed in the
master's service ; otherwise the servant shall alone answer
for his own misbehaviour .
On this principle it has been
held that if a servant , in driving or returning
from driving
his
master , or going
anywhere on his master's
business ,
negligently
injure
a third person , the master is liable ( 1) ;
though he is not so if the
servant at the time were using
his master's
horse and carriage
for his own purpose (m ).
Upon this principle ,
also , by the common law (n) , if a
servant
kept
his
master's
fire
negligently ,
so that his
neighbour's
house was burned
down
thereby , an action
lay against the master ;
because this negligence happened
in his
service ; otherwise , if the servant , going along the
street with a torch , by negligence
set fire to a house ; for
there he was not in his master's immediate
service , and
must himself have answered the damage personally .
And
this would
seem to be the law still , for though it has been
enacted (0) that no action
shall
lie
against any person
in
whose house
a
fire shall begin accidentally
,
yet the court
of
queen's bench decided that
the word
"
accidentally
"
did not apply
to
fires
caused by the negligence
of
either
the owner
or
any
of
his servants
(p
).
A
master would
also be chargeable
in
damages

domestic servant cast anything
out of his
house into the
street or common highway , to the damage of an individual
,
or to the
common
nuisance of the
public (q ) ; for the
master
has
the
superintendence
and
charge of all
his
household .
And this agrees with the civil law (r) ; which
holds
that
the pater familias , in this
and similar cases ,
" ob alterius culpam tenetur , aut servi, aut liberi.”
We may observe , that in cases such as have here been put,
the master may be frequently a loser by the trust reposed
in
a servant , but
never can be a gainer ;
he may be answer-
able for
his
servant's
misbehaviour , but cannot
shelter
himself from
punishment
by laying
the blame
on
his
agent .
The reason of this is still uniform
and the same ;
that the wrong
done by the servant is looked upon in law
as the wrong of the master himself ; and it is a standing
maxim , that no man shall be allowed to take
advantage
of his own wrong (s).

CHAPTER XV.
HUSBAND
AND WIFE .
THE
second
private
relation of persons is that created
by marriage , and includes the reciprocal rights and duties
of husband and wife ; or, as our older law-books call them ,
of baron and feme. In the consideration of which we shall ,
in the first
instance , inquire
how marriages
may be con-
tracted
or made ;
shall
next
point
out the manner
in
which they
may be dissolved ; and shall , lastly , take
a
view of the legal effects and consequences
of marriage , and
of its dissolution .
We must at once remind the reader , by way of preface ,
that
formerly ,
the
ecclesiastical
courts (a) ,
and
those
courts
only , had jurisdiction
in matrimonial
causes , and
possessed
the exclusive power of annulling
incestuous and
other unscriptural
marriages , though
as such courts were
supposed to act only pro salute animæ , their power gene-
rally ceased at the death of the parties implicated .
This
authority , claimed by the clergy in former
times , when
Roman Catholicism
was the
state religion , remained
in
the spiritual
courts till A.D.
1857 , when it was taken from
them by the statute 20 & 21 Vict . c. 85 , which established
the " Court for Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes " (b) .

the

other light than as a civil contract (c).
And , regarding it
in this light , our law treats it as it does other contracts
:
allowing it to be good
and valid
in all
cases , where the
parties at the time of making
it were , in the
first
place ,
willing
to
contract ;
secondly ,
able
to
contract ;
and ,
lastly ,
actually
did
contract , in
the
proper
forms
and
solemnities required by law.
" Con-
First , the parties
must be willing to contract .
sensus non concubitus , facit nuptias " is the maxim of the
Roman law in this
case (d) : and it was adopted by the
common lawyers (e) , who indeed have borrowed (especially
in ancient times ) almost all their notions of the legitimacy
of marriage from the canon and civil laws .
Secondly , the
parties
must
be
able to contract .
In
general
all persons
are
able
to contract
themselves in
marriage , unless they labour under
some
particular
dis-
abilities , and incapacities , the
nature of which
we have
next to consider .
These disabilities
were formerly
divided into two sorts,
first, those which were canonical , and therefore
sufficient
to avoid the marriage in the spiritual
court ; and secondly ,
those which
were
created , or at any rate were enforced by
municipal law.
The canonical
disabilities
had this parti-
cularity , that in our law, they
only
made the
marriage
voidable , and not ipso facto void , until sentence
of nullity
had
been
obtained .
Such
were pre-contract ;
consan-
guinity, or relation by blood ; and affinity , or relation by
marriage ; and
some
particular
corporal
infirmities
.
Of
these , the disability
of pre-contract
has been abolished ,
as we shall presently
see , and the others are now
cognis-
able
in the
temporal
courts ,
and
generally
make
the
marriage in itself utterly void .
These canonical
disabilities
were either
grounded

deducible from it ; it therefore being sinful in the persons
who labour under them to attempt to contract matrimony
together , such persons were subjected to the ecclesiastical
magistrate's
coercion ; in order to separate the offenders ,
and inflict penance for the offence , pro salute animarum .
Such
marriages ,
however ,

valid to all civil purposes , unless separation was actually
made during the life of the parties .
For , after the death
of either of them, the courts of common law would
not
suffer the spiritual courts
to declare such marriages
to
have been void ; because
such declaration could not tend
to the
reformation
of the
parties (ƒ) .
And therefore ,
when a man had married
his first wife's sister , and after
her death the bishop's court was proceeding to annul
the
marriage
and
bastardize
the
issue, the
court of king's
bench
granted
a prohibition
quoad hoc ;
but permitted
them to proceed to punish the husband for incest (g) .
Pre-contract was also held
to constitute
a disability,
but by stat . 32

other provisions
which will be hereafter referred to , all impediments arising .
from
pre-contracts
to
other persons were abolished and
declared of no effect , unless they had
been
consummated
with bodily knowledge
: in which
case the canon law held
such a contract
to
constitute a marriage
de facto .
This
branch of the statute was repealed by 2 & 3 Edw . 6 , c. 23,
but
as the 13th
section of 26 Geo . 2,
c
33 , expressly
provides , " that in no
case
whatsoever
shall
any suit or
proceeding
be had in any ecclesiastical
court in order to
compel a celebration of any marriage in facie ecclesiæ by
reason of any
contract of matrimony
whatever , whether
per verba de præsenti
or per verba
de futuro, any law or
usage to the contrary
notwithstanding
," it would appear
that the statute of Henry VIII . is not only revived but
extended , and that the disability by pre-contract is abolished ,
whether there has been consummation
or not .

526
HUSBAND
AND WIFE .
All the disabilities
for marriage now existing
have been
created , or at least
are enforceable by the municipal
laws .
And though
some of them may be grounded
on natural
law, they owe their efficacy to the laws of the land . These
civil disabilities , with two exceptions (
) , make the con-
tract
void
ab
initio , and not
merely
voidable ;
that
is ,
they do not dissolve
a contract
already formed , but they
render the parties incapable of performing
any contract at
all
they do not put
asunder
those who are joined toge-
ther , but they
previously
hinder
the junction .
And if
any persons
under these legal
incapacities
come together ,
it is a meretricious , not a matrimonial
, union .
1.
The first of these
legal
disabilities
is a prior mar-
riage , or the having
another husband
or wife living ; in
which
case , besides the penalties consequent upon it as a
felony , the second
marriage
is to all intents and purposes
void (i)
polygamy
being
contrary
to the
spirit of the
New Testament , and the policy of all prudent
states , espe-
cially in these northern
climates .
And Justinian , even
in the
climate
of modern
Turkey,
is
express
(k) , that
"duas uxores eodem tempore habere non licet."
2. The next
legal
disability is want of age.
This
is
sufficient to render voidable other contracts , on account of
the imbecility
of judgment
in the
infant
who contracts :
a fortiori , therefore , it ought
to avoid this, the
most
important contract
of any.
Therefore , if a boy
under
fourteen , or a girl under twelve years of age , marries , this
marriage is only inchoate and imperfect ; and when either
of them comes
to the age of consent aforesaid , they may
disagree
and
declare
the
marriage
void ,
without
any
divorce or sentence
in a court.
This is founded
on the
civil law.
But the canon law paid
a greater regard to
the constitution , than the
age of the parties (1) : for if
they were habiles ad matrimonium , it was a good marriage ,
(h) That is to say, want
of age,
and certain physical
infirmities .

HOW

CONTRACTED .

whatever their age might be .
And in our law it is so far
a marriage
that , if at the age of consent the contracting
parties
agree
to
continue
together ,
they
need
not be
married
again (m). If the husband
be of years of dis-
cretion , and the wife
under
twelve , when
she comes to
years of discretion he may disagree
as well as she ; for in
this contract
the obligation
must be mutual
; both
must
be bound , or neither : and so it is , vice
versa , when the
wife is of years of discretion , and the husband under (n ).
This doctrine does not , however , extend beyond the actual
marriage
contract , referred
to the
ages
of fourteen
and
twelve ; for it has
long
been
settled that if one of two
parties to a contract to marry in futuro, be under twenty-
one, and the other above
that age, the former
only can
maintain
an action
for a breach of the promise , without
being exposed to a plea of infancy , for such a contract is
voidable by the minor on attaining
majority (o).
3. A third
incapacity
is want of reason ;
without a
competent
share of which neither
can the
matrimonial
nor any
other
contract
be valid .
It was formerly
ad-
judged , that
the
issue of an idiot was legitimate , and
consequently that his marriage was valid (p).
A strange
determination
!
since
consent
is absolutely
requisite to
matrimony , and neither idiots nor lunatics
are
capable of
consenting
to any thing.
And
therefore
the civil law
judged much more sensibly when it made deprivation
of
reason
a previous
impediment
;
though
not
a
cause
of
divorce , if it happened after marriage (q).
And modern
resolutions
have adhered to the reason of the civil law, by
determining
that
the marriage of a lunatic , not being in
a lucid interval , was absolutely void (r) .
But as it might

be difficult to prove the exact state of the party's mind at
the actual celebration of the nuptials , the statute 15 Geo .
2, c . 30 provided that the marriage of a lunatic
(if found
lunatic
under
a commission , or committed
to the care of
trustees by any
act of
parliament ), before he or she is
declared of
sound mind by the
lord
chancellor
or the
majority of such trustees , shall be void .
4. There is another
disability , viz . : in respect of rela-
tionship , whether by consanguinity
or affinity .
By statute
32 Hen. 8, c.
38, it is
declared ,
that
all persons
may
lawfully marry , but
such as are prohibited
by God's law ;
and that all marriages contracted by lawful persons in the
face of the church , and consummated with bodily
know-
ledge and fruit of children , shall be indissoluble .
And ,
(because , by the Roman Catholic
church , various degrees
of kindred
were
made
impediments
to marriage , which
impediments
were
often ,
however ,
bought
off for
money) it is declared by the
same
statute , that nothing
(God's law excepted ) shall
impeach
any marriage ,
but
within the Levitical degrees , the farthest of which
is that
between uncle
and
niece (s).
Therefore , the
marriages
now prohibited , are
those
between parties related to each
other , either by consanguinity
or affinity , within the third
degree inclusive (t).
Marriages
between parties who are
in the fourth or any higher
degree
are lawful ;
as between
first cousins , a nephew and a great
aunt , or a niece and
her great uncle .
Relationship
by affinity
always
arises
from the marriage of one of the parties so related , but it
extends
only
to the
consanguinei
of
each
party re-
spectively (u).
Thus a husband is related by affinity
to all
the consanguinei of his
wife ,
and
vice
versâ a wife
to
all
the
consanguinei
of
her
husband
;
and
conse-
quently
a man
cannot marry
the
sister
of his
deceased

But a man may marry his brother's wife's
sister , and a widower
may marry
the widow of his wife's
brother , for
no
relationship
or
affinity
whatever
exists
between the parties .
5. Lastly , the parties
must
not
only
be willing and
able to contract , but actually
must contract themselves in
due
form
of law to make a good civil marriage .
Any
contract made, per verba
de præsenti , or in words of the
present tense, in the presence of, and with the assistance
of a priest in holy orders , was a valid marriage at common
law, before the
statute
26
Geo . 2 ,
c.
33
(A.D. 1753 ) ;
indeed there are authorities
to the effect that such a con-
tract
was a valid
marriage
without
the
presence of a
priest , though
it is more than doubtful
whether
such
would be held to be the case now (w) .
From the passing
of the above mentioned statute , till
A.D. 1822 , it was held that no marriage
was valid which
was not celebrated in some parish church or public
chapel ,
(unless by dispensation
from the archbishop of Canter-
bury) .
It must
also have
been preceded
by publication
of banns , or by licence
from the spiritual
judge (x) ; in
the
latter
case ,
however ,
the
consent of parents
or
guardians
was necessary when either party
was a minor ,
unmarried
previously .
Many other formalities
were like-

Pope
Innocent III. , first ordained the ce-
lebration
of marriage in the church
(Moor,

before which it was
totally a civil

, all
marriages
were
performed
by jus-
tices of the peace ; and these mar-
riages were declared valid , without

wise prescribed by the act ; the neglect of which , though
penal , did not invalidate
the marriage .
As the law then stood, we may upon the whole collect ,
that no marriage by the temporal law was ipso facto void
if celebrated by a person in orders ,—in a parish church ,
or public chapel , (or elsewhere by special dispensation )—in
pursuance of banns or a licence ,-between single persons ,-
not being within the prohibited
degrees
of relationship ,—
consenting (y) , — of
sound
mind , —and
of
the
age of
twenty -one years ; or of the age of fourteen in males and
twelve in females , with consent of parents or guardians , or
without in
case
of
widowhood .
And no marriage was
voidable by the ecclesiastical law, after the death of either
of the parties ,
nor
during
their
lives , unless
for the
canonical impediments of consanguinity
and of affinity , or
corporal imbecility , subsisting previous to the marriage .
The rigid enforcement of the above rules having led to
much inconvenience , the provisions of the act of Geo. II.
were first relaxed by 3 Geo. 4 , c. 75 , and then by 4 Geo . 4,
c. 76 ;
and as those acts still rendered it necessary
for all
persons, except
Quakers and Jews , to be married accord-
ing to the rites of the established church , further relax-
ations in favour of
non-conformists
of
all descriptions
were made by 6 & 7 Will . 4 , c. 85 , which has
since been
amended by subsequent enactments (~).
With regard
to the
forms
now
requisite , the subject
may
be most conveniently
regarded
under the following
divisions :
1. Marriages
by the
established
church ; and
2. Other marriages (~).
1.
For the legal constitution of any marriage solemnised
according
to the forms
of the
established
church , it is
necessary
that it either be preceded
by the publication
of
banns for three
Sundays in the parish
church
or public

ling Bill, 2 H. L. Cas. 48.

(b), or order in council
(c).
Although
banns
are
intended
as
a security
against
clandestine and unlawful
marriages , the law has given the
clergyman
no express
power to call for or compel infor-
mation

stances of parties unknown to him ;

A common
licence may be obtained by any person who
is prepared to make the requisite payments , and to declare
on oath that one of the parties
to be married , has , for
the preceding
fifteen
days had his , or her, usual place of
abode within the parish or district , in the church or chapel
of which the marriage is to be solemnised ;
that there is
no lawful
impediment
to the marriage

to the
deponent , and , (if either party be a minor , not previously

(if any) has been
obtained (h).
The
only
penalty
ex-
pressly imposed by law for the false statement of any of

benefits which the party
might take under

other
modes of solemnisation , which

The clergy of the established church are
not bound , but they are at liberty
to solemnise marriage
under these certificates ( ) ; a small portion , however , only
of church marriages being
so celebrated .
A marriage by common licence , or by a clergyman under
a registrar's certificate , must be solemnised in a church or
chapel named in the licence , or within the district of the
registrar .
And every church
marriage

for
its
celebration

HOW
MARRIAGE
MAY BE
CONTRACTED .
537
The
consent of parents
or guardians
(subject
to
an
appeal to the court of chancery in
cases of unreasonable
refusal (h) ) , is so far required by law, that the parent or
guardian
by
publicly
forbidding
the
banns ( ),
or the
solemnisation , or by caveat (k), or by entry in the regis-
trar's marriage
notice book (1) , may prevent
the banns
from
proceeding ,
or
the
licence
or
certificate
(as the
case
may be ) from
issuing , or the marriage from taking
place ; and the
consequence
of the marriage of a minor ,
without the proper
consent, may
be , that the court
of
chancery will
deprive the offending
party
of any
pecu-
niary benefit from the marriage (m).
But it
is not in-
cumbent on any clergyman , surrogate , or superintendent
registrar ,
to call
for
any proof of consent beyond
the
declarations of the parties , when a licence is applied for,
or notice given
to
a registrar

con-
sent, is valid in law (n).

Further , a marriage

the statute
6 & 7 Will . 4 , c. 85 , is by
that act declared to be " null and void " if the parties shall
" knowingly and wilfully " intermarry
in any place other
than the church , chapel , or registered building
specified in
the notice and certificate , or without
due notice
to the
superintendent
registrar , or without
the superintendent
registrar's
certificate , duly issued , or without
his licence ,
when necessary, or in the absence
of a registrar or super-
intendent
registrar , where his
presence
is necessary under
the act .
No publication
of banns ,
common
or
special
licence , or superintendent
registrar's
certificate or licence ,
is available
as legal authority for the solemnisation of a
marriage at any time more remote than three months from
the date of the last publication
of banns or of the issue of
the licence or certificate (a).
A marriage
cannot lawfully be contracted according to
the peculiar usages of the Quakers , except between
persons ,
both ofwhom are members of, or, (if not members ,) " pro-
fess with
and
are of the
persuasion
of " the Society of
Friends , nor according to the peculiar usages of the Jews ,
except between persons , both of whom are of the Jewish
religion.
These usages being
referred to by the statutes
as the rules of lawful solemnisation , difficult
questions ,
perhaps
even affecting the validity of marriages bond fide
contracted , may be liable to arise, in
cases in which it
may be alleged that those usages have not

observed .
Except, however , in these peculiar
cases , of
Quakers and Jews , no marriage in England is liable to be
held
void
on
any ground
connected
with
the
religious
belief or persuasion of both or either of the parties thereto ,
in whatever
form , by whatever
person, or in whatever
place it may have been solemnised .
It must
be remembered
that
none of the
marriage
acts (b) here
mentioned
affect the
royal
family , whose
marriages
are regulated by the common law as modified
by the Royal
Marriage
Act (c) , nor to marriages
taking
place abroad (d) , respecting
which
there has been some
recent legislation .
II. We have next to consider the manner in which
a
marriage may be dissolved ; and this is either by death , or
divorce .
Before the year 1857 , when the Divorce Act was
passed , divorce as well as marriage was within the cogni-
sance of the ecclesiastical
courts .
There were two kinds
of divorce , the
one total , the
other
partial
;
the
one a
vinculo matrimonii , the other, a mensâ
et thoro .
The total
divorce , a vinculo matrimonii , was always for some one of
the
canonical
causes
of impediment
before mentioned
;
and those existing
before the marriage ,
as is always
the
case in consanguinity
or
affinity
;
not
supervenient , or
arising
afterwards , as
may be the
case in corporal im-
becility .
For in a case of total divorce , the marriage was
declared
null ,
as
having
been absolutely
unlawful
ab
initio ; and the parties were therefore separated pro salute
animarum : for which
reason , as was before observed
, no
divorce
could
be
obtained , but
during the life of the

tender of dissolving it ;
but for some supervenient cause ,
it became improper or impossible for the parties to live to-
gether
as in case of cruelty , or adultery in either of the
parties .
For the canon law,
which the
common law
followed
in this
case ,
deemed
so highly and with such
mysterious reverence of the nuptial
tie, that it would not
allow it to be unloosed for any
cause whatsoever , that
arose after the union was made.
And this was said to be
though that expressly
built on the divine
revealed law ;
assigns
incontinence
as
a cause , and indeed the
only
cause ,
why
a man
may put
away his wife
and
marry
another (g).
But in England adultery was only a cause of separation
from
bed and board (h) :
for which
the best reason that
could be given was the supposition , that if divorces were
allowed
to
depend upon
a matter within the
power of
either of the parties , they would
probably
be extremely
frequent ; as was the case when divorces were allowed for
canonical
disabilities ,
on
the
mere
confession of the
parties ( ).
However , divorces
a vinculo matrimonii , for
adultery were for many years frequently granted by act of
parliament
:
but only upon strict
proof of the
adultery ;
and , in general , only after a sentence
of divorce a mensa
et thoro, by the ecclesiastical court , and ,
(if the husband
were the petitioner ) , after verdict against the adulterer in
a trial at law (k) .
From
such
a state of the
law it practically
resulted
that
divorces
on what
were
deemed
sufficient

legal existence of the woman
is
in
many respects suspended during the marriage
,
or
at
least
is
incorporated
and consolidated into that
of
the husband
:
under
whose wing

protection
,
and
cover
,
she performs
every thing and
is
therefore
called

our law

condition

all the legal rights

a

between husband
and wife , when
single , are voided by
the intermarriage
(x).
A man
may ,
however ,
covenant
with others as trustees for his wife , and a conveyance may
be made to trustees for the benefit of his wife , as here-
after explained (y) .
A woman indeed may act as agent (z)
for her husband , for that implies
no separation from , but
is rather
a representation of, her lord .
And a husband
may also bequeath anything
to his wife by will ; for that
cannot take effect till the
coverture is determined by his
death (a).
The husband is generally bound by contracts of his wife ,
his assent to them
being
ordinarily
presumed from
co-
habitation , though
this
presumption
is capable of being
rebutted ;
and
as a husband
ought
to provide
his wife
with
necessaries
, he
is
generally
obliged
to pay debts
which
she has been compelled
to incur in providing
them
for herself ;
but it is otherwise with regard to things
which are not necessaries
, and for such the husband is not
liable
unless they have been
supplied by his
authority .
The presumption of authority
from the husband does not ,
however ,
arise
when the husband
and wife
are living
apart from
each other , and in such
case the husband is
usually
not liable if he allows his wife a sufficient allow-
ance and takes care that it be paid , though in the absence
of any such allowance he is generally liable , except in the
case of her elopement and living with another man (6).
As regards
property
possessed
by the wife whilst sole,
it must here suffice to say, that all personalty of a corpo-
real nature , such as goods or cash, then

such
property
given
to
or acquired by the wife
after
marriage
also vests in the husband .
But choses
in action.
belonging
to the wife before marriage do not on marriage
vest in the husband , unless he does
some act to reduce
them into
possession
during the
coverture ,
and
even
during
coverture
the husband
may permit
the
wife
to
make
a contract , in an action
on which he
may join
with her during her life
though
he
may
disaffirm her
interest
and
sue on the
contract
as made with himself
alone .
If he does
permit
the wife to make such
a con-
tract and
does
not reduce it into possession during the
coverture it survives to the wife (c).
Again , if the
wife
be indebted
before marriage , the
husband
is bound afterwards to pay the debt ; for he has
adopted her and her circumstances
together (d ) ;
but , in
respect of such antecedent indebtedness he must be sued
jointly with her-not separately (e) ; and if she die before
payment
the
husband
is
free from
every
such
claim ,
unless she leaves property to which he administers (ƒ) . If
the wife be injured in her person or her property , she can
bring no action for redress without
her husband's concur-
rence ,
and
must
bring it in his name as well
as her
own (g) :
neither
can she be
sued
without
making
her
husband
a defendant (h) .
There is indeed one case of rare
occurrence where the wife can sue and be sued as a feme
sole, viz., where the legal existence of the husband
is con-
sidered as extinguished
or suspended , that is to say when

he is dead in law (2) , for then the husband being thus dis-
abled to sue for or defend the wife , it would be unreason-
able, if she had no remedy or could
make no defence at
all .
In criminal prosecutions , however , the
wife
might
always
have
been
indicted
and
punished
separately (k) :
for marriage is only a civil union .
According to the civil law husband and wife were con-
sidered as two distinct persons ;
and might have separate
estates , contracts , or debts , and sustain separate injuries
(◊) ;
and, therefore , in our ecclesiastical courts , as formerly con-
stituted , the procedure of which was in a great measure
founded on, and regulated by the civil law, a woman might
sue and be sued without her husband (m) ; and in courts
of equity the
husband
and wife are , for many
purposes ,
regarded as distinct
persons :
ex. gr. the wife may have a
separate estate under
the
doctrine of trusts
;
and
may
bind the same by her separate
contracts ; and she may sue
and be sued in respect of such contracts or in relation to
such estate.
Moreover , though our common law in general considers
man and wife as one person , yet , there are some instances
in which the wife is separately considered ;
as inferior to the
husband and acting by his compulsion .
She cannot by will
devise property
to her husband , unless under a power of
appointment
or other special circumstances : the original
reason for which appears to have been that at the time of
making
the will she was supposed to have been under his
coercion (n).
And in
some felonies
and other
inferior
crimes , committed by the wife , through constraint of her
husband , the law excuses her ;
but this extends not to
treason or murder or some other offences
(o).
The husband
also (by the old law) might give his
wife
moderate correction (p).
For as he was to answer for her

misbehaviour , the law thought it reasonable to intrust
him
with this
power
of
restraining
her ,
by
domestic
chastisement , with the same moderation
that
a man is
allowed
to correct his apprentices or children .
But this
power of
correction
was
confined
within
reasonable
bounds (g),
and the husband
was prohibited
from
using
any
violence
to his wife
aliter quam ad virum , ex causâ
regiminis et castigationis

suce , licite et rationabiliter

The
civil law gave the husband the same,
or
a larger authority
over his wife :
allowing him for
some misdemeanors , flagellis et fustibus
acriter verberare
uxorem ;
for
others ,
only
modicam
castigationem
adhi-
bere (s).
But with us, in the reign of Charles II. , this
power of correction
began to be doubted (t) : and a wife
may
now
have security
of the
peace
against
her hus-
band (u) ;
or , a husband against his wife (x) .
Yet there
can be no question respecting
the
common law right of
a husband
to
restrain
his
wife of her personal
liberty ,
with a view to prevent her going into society of which he
disapproves , or otherwise disobeying his rightful authority
;
such right must not , however , be exercised unnecessarily
or with undue
severity ;
and the moment that the wife ,
by returning to her
conjugal duties , makes
restraint of
her
person
unnecessary ,
such
restraint
becomes
un-
lawful (y).

Secondly we have to consider the effect of the

distributions , will
be treated of in our
Second Volume.
It is only necessary here to mention
that , whereas the
husband of a woman
indebted whilst
sole , is freed from
her
creditor's
claims
after
her
death (2) , the wife
sur-
viving her husband becomes
again liable to them .
The remaining questions are as to the effect of a divorce ,
or a judicial separation
:-
The separation effected
by a divorce is so complete that
if the divorced persons again cohabited their union would
be adulterous , and their
children
would
be illegitimate
,
but
there
seems
nothing
to
prevent
divorced
persons
being re-married if they choose ; of course if the marriage
be pronounced
void
on the ground
of consanguinity
, or
otherwise , the effect is the
same
as if it had never taken
place .
Further , in a case of dissolution
of marriage on
the ground of the misconduct of either party the court in
its discretion
may allot alimony , and may make arrange-
ments with regard to subsisting
settlements .
A judicial separation has the same effect (a) as had the
divorce a menså et thoro formerly granted by the ecclesias-
tical courts , and is , as that
term
implied , merely
a legal
severance
from bed and board , leaving the matrimonial
tie
unloosed ;
consequently
the
parties
may
return
to
co-
habitation
at any time when they may mutually choose to
do so.
As far as property
is concerned , and the right of
suing and being sued in court , a wife , after a sentence of
judicial
separation , stands in the position of a feme sole ,
and the court has powers of allotting alimony and making
arrangements with regard to property .
The right to the custody
of children
in the
cases of
divorce
or judicial
separation will be treated of in the
next chapter .

With us
in England , however , the rule is narrowed , for the nuptials
must
be precedent to the birth ; of which more will
be
said when we come to consider the case of bastardy .
At
present let us inquire into :

to their legitimate
children .

The
power of parents
over their children .

The
duties of such children

1. The duties of parents to legitimate
children
princi- 1. Duties of
pally consist in three particulars
; their maintenance , their their chil-
protection , and their education .
The duty of parents to provide
for the maintenance of
their children , depends
on a principle
of natural law ; it is
an obligation , says Puffendorf
( b) , laid
on them
not only
by nature
herself , but by their own act, in bringing them
into the world
for they would
be in the highest degree

injurious
to their issue , if they only gave their children
life , and afterwards
let them
perish .
By begetting chil-
dren , therefore , the parents have entered into a voluntary
obligation , to endeavour , as far as in them
lies , that the
life
which
they
have
bestowed shall
be supported
and
preserved.
Thus children
have morally
a perfect right of
receiving maintenance
from their parents .
And Montes-
quieu (c) justly observes
upon this head : that the estab-
lishment of marriage in all civilized
states
is built on this
natural
obligation of the father
to provide for his children :
for marriage ascertains and makes known the person who
is bound to fulfil
such obligation
:
whereas , in promis-
cuous and illicit conjunctions , the father is unknown
; and
the mother finds a thousand obstacles in her way ;-shame ,
remorse , the constraint of her sex , and the rigour of laws ;
-that stifle her inclinations
to perform this
duty ; and
besides , she usually wants ability.
The municipal
laws of well -regulated
states
have taken
care to enforce this duty : though
Providence
has done it
more effectually than any laws , by generally
implanting
in the breast of parents a natural affection , which not even
the deformity of person or mind , not even the wickedness ,
ingratitude , and rebellion of children
can totally
suppress
or extinguish .
The civil law (d) obliged
the parent to provide
mainte-
nance for his child : and said , if he refused , "judex de ed
re cognoscet ."
Nay, it carried this matter so far , that it
would not suffer a parent at his death totally
to disinherit
his child, without
expressly giving his reason for so doing ;
and
there
were
fourteen
such
reasons
reckoned up (e) ,
which might justify
such
disinherison . If the
parent
alleged no reason , or a bad, or a false one, the child might
set
the will
aside , tanquam
testamentum
inofficiosum , a
testament
contrary
to the natural
duty
of the
parent .
And it is remarkable
under what colour the children
were

551
to move for relief in such a case ; by suggesting that the
parent had lost the use of his reason ; when he made the
inofficious testament . For this , as Puffendorf
remarks (ƒ) ,
was not to bring into
dispute the
testator's power of dis-
inheriting his own offspring ; but to examine the motives
upon which he did it : and , if they were found defective in
reason , then to set them aside.
This , however , was surely
going too far ; every man
has, or ought to have, by the
laws of society , a power over his own property : and , as
Grotius
very
well
distinguishes (g) ,
though
children
may have a natural
right to a necessary maintenance ;
yet
to
anything
more
they
can have
no
other
right
than
that
which
is
given them by the favour
of their
parents , or the
positive
constitutions
of the
municipal
law.
Let us next see what provision our own laws have made
for this natural
duty .
It has by some been thought that
there is a legal obligation
imposed
on every man to pro-
vide for his children
; but the common law of England (h)
seems never to have afforded any means of enforcing such
duty if it existed (i) .
Such
principle
has , however , been
recognised , and such
duty
has been
enforced by various
statutes
beginning
as
long ago as the reign of queen
Elizabeth , and it is now enacted
that the father , mother ,
grandfather , and grandmother of every poor , blind , lame ,
and impotent person , or other poor person not able to work ,
(f) L. 4, c. 11, s. 7.
(g) De Jur. Bel.
et.
Pac . 1. 2,
c. 7, s. 4, n. 3.
(h) It is now settled that this is
a moral obligation
merely , not en-
forceable
at
law ;
Mortimore
v.
Wright, 6 M. & W. 482.
Neverthe-
less if anybody
supplies
an infant
with necessaries fit for his station ,
very slight evidence of the father's
assent to such
supply will usually
suffice to make him liable to pay
for them
under
an implied
con-
tract .
See Law v. Willin, 6 A. &
E.
718.
(i) Cooper v. Martin , 4 East , 84.
It seems, however , to have been an
indictable
offence
to
refuse
or
neglect to provide
sufficient
food ,
bedding , &c., and so to injure the
health
of any
infant of
tender
years , servant , apprentice , or child,

shall , if of
sufficient
ability (k) ,
at their
own
charges ,
relieve and
maintain
such
poor person in such manner ,
and
at such rate
as
shall
be
adjudged by the
quarter
sessions (1) , or by two or more justices in petty sessions ( m ) ,
and if such sum be not duly paid , it may be
recovered
(together with a penalty of twenty shillings a month for
not paying it) by distress or imprisonment
( n). The provi-
sions of this statute have long been held to extend only to
blood relations , and therefore
no one was bound under it
to support those who were connected with him by affinity
only (0) ; but now , by statute 4 & 5 Will . 4 , c. 76 , s . 57 ,
a man marrying a woman who has children
at the time of
such marriage ,
is
compelled
to support
them till they
respectively
attain
the
age of sixteen , or until the death
of the mother , and this liability is irrespective of the fact
of their being legitimate
or illegitimate
.
No person is bound to provide
a maintenance
for his
issue , unless such children

of such child shall

jured,

shall

Though

is
primarily
liable to
support
his child, it has

and then is
only
obliged
to
find
them
necessaries
, the
requisite
amount thereof being determined by the justices .
For the policy of our laws , which
are ever watchful
to
promote
industry , did
not mean to
compel
a father
to
maintain his idle and lazy children in ease and indolence ,
and thought it unjust
to oblige the parent against his will
to provide them with superfluities , and other indulgences
of fortune ; imagining
they might
trust to the impulse of
nature if the
children
were deserving
of such
favours .
There
were two
exceptions
to
this
rule
when religious
bigotry was
very
strong , it being
enacted by stat .
11
Will . 3 , c. 4 , that if any popish parent should , in order to
induce
him
to
change his
religion , refuse to allow
a
protestant
child a fitting maintenance , according
to his
fortune , the lord - chancellor
might , by order of the court ,
compel him to do what was just and reasonable ; and very
shortly
afterwards
a
similar
provision
was
made with
respect to Jews , by 1 Anne , stat. 1. c. 24 , and both these
enactments
remained in force till A.D.
1846 , having been
repealed by the 9 & 10 Vict . c. 59 .
Our law has made no provision
to prevent the disinhe-
riting of children by will : leaving
every man's
property
in his own disposal , upon a principle of liberty in this , as
well as other actions ;
though
among persons of rank or
fortune , a competence
is
generally provided
for younger
children , and the bulk of the
estate
settled
upon the
eldest.
The
heir , also , is
a favourite
of our
courts of
justice , and cannot
be disinherited
by dubious
or ambi-
guous words ; there
being

maintain

uphold
his
children
in
their law-suits
without being guilty of the legal
crime of maintaining
quarrels (r).
A parent
may
also justify an assault
and
battery
in defence
of the
person of his
child (s) .
Such
indulgence
does
the law show to the frailty of human
nature , and the workings
of parental affection .
The last duty of parents to their legitimate children
is
that of giving them an education
suitable to their station
in life ; a duty pointed
out by reason, and manifestly of
the
greatest
importance .
For ,
as
Puffendorff
well ob-
serves (t), it is not easy to imagine or allow, that a parent
has conferred
any considerable
benefit upon his child by
bringing him into the world , if he afterwards
entirely
neglects
his
culture
and education ,
and
suffers him to
grow up like a mere beast , to lead a life useless to others ,
and
shameful
to himself.
Our municipal
laws
do
not ,
however ,
constrain
parents
to bestow
proper
education
upon their children .
Perhaps
they think it punishment
enough to leave the parent , who neglects the instruction
of his family , to labour
under
those griefs
and inconve-
niences, which his family, so uninstructed , will be sure to
bring
upon
him ; and they leave the rich to their own
option , whether
they will bring up their children
to be
ornaments or disgraces to their family (u).
Nevertheless ,
the legislature
has made from time to time certain pro-
visions for the improvement and education of the poor.

It is
true
that
through
a dread of
interfering
with
individual liberty,
education
has not
as yet
been made
universally
compulsory
; but institutions
have been estab-
lished
for those who most require
them , in the shape of
industrial or reformatory schools , for those who have fallen ,
or are likely to fall , into crime (x), and of educational
establishments
for pauper
children (y) , who are thus not
permitted
to grow up in entire
ignorance (≈) , and lastly ,
enactments have been made for regulating
factories and

it is provided

therein shall be bound to attend

And
upon this
score the municipal

a
much
larger
authority
to the
parents than others.
The
ancient
Roman
laws
gave the father a power of life and
death over his children
; upon this principle , that he who
gave had
also the power of taking
away (6).
But
the
rigour of these laws was softened by subsequent constitu-
tions ; so that (c) we find a father banished by the emperor
Hadrian for killing
his son, though he had committed
a
very heinous crime , upon this maxim , that " patria potes-

authority
for a son could not acquire any property of his
own during
the life of his father ; but all his acquisitions
belonged to the father , or at least the profits of them for
his life (d).
The power of a parent by our English laws is much more
moderate ; but still
sufficient
to keep the
child in order
and obedience
.
He may lawfully correct his child , being
under age, in a reasonable manner (e) ; this being for the
benefit of his
education .
The
consent or concurrence of
the parent to the marriage of his child under age is also ,
as we have seen (f), directed by our law to be obtained .
Under
ordinary circumstances
a father is the guardian of
his children , and entitled to the custody of them , so that
if they be taken from him when under age , a habeas corpus
lies
for their restitution , and at any rate till the age of
sixteen they cannot leave him
against
his will , whether
they desire to do so or not (g) .
And the unlawful
abduc-
tion of a daughter
under the
age
specified
is a misde-
meanor (h) .
The father is entitled to the custody of his
children
as against
other persons till they attain the age
of twenty - one ; but they will
not
be obliged to return to
him against
their will , if they be of an age to exercise a
choice, and this age seems to be sixteen (?) .
This paternal
power applies to the father
only , and not to the mother ,
who has none during her husband's life (k) ; indeed , until
recently the mother might be excluded by the father from
all access to her children ; and though
the husband thus
acted avowedly for extortion
or intimidation
, the
court
would not relax the rule (7). And even the court of chancery

refused to interfere with the legal right of the father to
absolute dominion
over his infant children , being wards of
court , unless upon
distinct
proof that he was of immoral
and irreligious principles , and that his children were likely
to be corrupted by him (m) . But now , by 2 & 3 Vict . c. 54 ,
a mother
(unless
an adulteress ) , may by petition
to the
court of chancery (n ) , obtain
an order for
access
to her
infant children , at such times and subject to such regula-
tions
as the court shall think
proper ; and if such infant
or infants shall be within the age of seven years, she may
obtain an order that they be delivered to and remain in
her
custody until
attaining
such
age ,
subject
to such
regulations
as
aforesaid ,
and
by the divorce
acts ,
the
court is allowed to make arrangements for the custody of
children , pendente
lite, and afterwards , for their permanent
custody and maintenance (0) .
This power of a father
over
the
person of his child
ceases at the age of twenty -one , when he is supposed to
have arrived at years of discretion , unless the
father , by
consenting
to his child's
marriage
previously
to attaining
that
age,
has
impliedly
emancipated
him.
And this
authority of the father may continue even after
his death ,
for he may by his will appoint
a guardian to his children .
He may
also, during
his
lifetime , delegate part of his
parental
authority
to the tutor or
schoolmaster
of his
child, who is then in loco parentis , and has such a portion
of the power of the parent
committed to his

that of restraint

fancy , are entitled
to our protection
in the infirmity of
their
age ; they, who by sustenance and education
have
enabled their
offspring
to prosper , ought in return to be
supported by that offspring
in case they stand in need of
assistance .
Upon this
principle
proceed
all the duties of
children
to their parents which
are enjoined by positive
laws .
And the Athenian laws (p) carried
this principle
most strictly into
practice ; obliging children
to provide
for their father , when fallen into poverty ; with an excep-
tion in the
case of
spurious
children , of those
whose
chastity
had
been prostituted
by
consent of the
father ,
and of those whom he had not put in any way of gaining
a livelihood .
The
legislature , says
Montesquieu (g) , con-
sidered , that in the first case the father , being uncertain ,
had rendered the natural
obligation
precarious ; that in
the second
case , he had sullied
the life he had given , and
done his
children
the greatest of injuries , in depriving
them of their reputation ; and that in the third case he
had rendered their life (so far as in him lay ) an
insup-
portable
burthen , by furnishing them with no means of
subsistence .
Our laws agree with those of Athens with regard to the
first only of these particulars , the case of spurious issue.
In the other cases the law does not hold the tie of nature
to be dissolved
by any misbehaviour
of the
parent ; and
therefore a child is equally justifiable in defending
the
person of a bad parent as a good one ; and is compellable ,
if of sufficient
ability, to maintain
a parent in distress
and unable
to
work, whatever
his
conduct
may have
been (r).

bastard.
1. A bastard , by our English
law, is one who
is not 1. Who is a
only begotten , but
born , out of lawful matrimony .
The
civil and canon
laws do not
allow
a child
to remain
a
bastard , if the
parents
afterwards
intermarry (s) :
and
herein
they
differ
most
materially
from our
own law ;
which , though
not
so strict as to require
that the child
shall be begotten , yet
makes it
an indispensable
con-
dition , to make it legitimate , that it shall
be born , after
lawful wedlock (t).
And our English law seems
superior
in this respect to the Roman , if we consider the principal
end and design of the contract of marriage
taken
in
a
civil light ;
abstractedly
from any religious
view .
The
main
end and
design of marriage in a state being to
ascertain and fix upon some
certain
person , to whom
the
care, the protection , the maintenance , and the education
of the children
should
belong :
this end is undoubtedly
better answered by legitimating all issue born after wed-
lock, than
by legitimating
all issue of the
same
parties
even born
before wedlock , provided
wedlock
afterwards
ensues
; (1. ) Because of the uncertainty
there may be in
proving
that the issue was begotten by the
same
man ;
whereas by confining
the
proof
to the birth, and not to
the begetting , our law has rendered it certain what child
is to be deemed
legitimate , and who is to take care of the
child.
(2.) Because by the
Roman
law a child
may be
allowed to remain
a bastard , or be made legitimate , at the
option of the father
and mother by a marriage
ex post
facto; thereby opening
a door to frauds
and partialities
which by our law
are
prevented .

law a man may remain a bastard till forty years of age ,

of his
parents ; whereby the main
end of marriage ,
the
protection
of infants , is
frustrated .
(4.) Because this
rule of the Roman law admits of no limitations
as to time
or as to the number of bastards so to be legitimated
; but
a dozen of them
may , twenty years after their birth, by
the subsequent marriage of their
parents , be admitted
to
the privileges
of legitimate
children .
This is plainly a
discouragement to the
matrimonial
state ; to which one.
main
inducement is usually not only the desire of having
children , but also the desire of procreating
lawful heirs .
Whereas
our constitutions
guard
against this
indecency ,
and at the same time give sufficient allowance to the frailties
of human nature .
For , if a child be begotten while
the
parents
are single , and they will
endeavour to make an
early reparation for the offence , by marrying
within a few
months
after , our law will not bastardise the child , if it
be born , though not begotten in lawful wedlock
for this
is
an incident
that can happen but once , since all future
children of the same
parents will be lawfully and honour-
ably begotten.
Upon reasons like these we may suppose
the peers to have
acted
at the parliament of Merton
(u) ,
when
they
refused to
enact that
children
born
before
marriage should be esteemed
legitimate .
:
From what
has been said , it
appears
that all
children
born before matrimony
are bastards by our law
and so it
is of all children
born so long
after the death of the hus-
band , that by the usual course of gestation , they could not
be begotten by him .
But this being
a matter of some
uncertainty , our law is not
exact as to a few
days , and
has
not
authoritatively
established
any fixed period for
gestation , but the legitimacy
or illegitimacy
of a posthu-
mous child is in each
particular
case
a question
for the
jury (x).
This uncertainty , however , gave rise to a pecu-
liar proceeding at common law, where a widow was
sus-
pected
to feign
herself with child , in order
to produce

supposititious
heir
to the
estate.
In this
case the heir
presumptive
or a
devisee
over
on
failure
of issue (y) ,
may have a writ de ventre inspiciendo , to examine whether
she be with child or not (2) ; and , if she be , to keep her
under
proper
restraint , till delivered ; which
is entirely
conformable to the practice of the civil law (a) ; but if the
widow be upon due examination
found not pregnant , the
presumptive
heir shall
be admitted
to the inheritance ,
though liable to lose it again , on the birth of a child within
due time from the death of the husband (b) .
But if a man
dies , and his widow soon after marries again , and a child is
born within such a time , as that by the course of nature it
might have been the child of either husband ; in this case he
was once said to be more than ordinarily
legitimate
; for he
might, when he arrived at years of discretion , choose which
of the fathers
he pleased (c) .
But
this doctrine , if ever
recognized , was too absurd to last , and it was afterwards
held to be a question for the jury to determine , according
to the evidence
, which husband was most likely to be the
father (d) .
To prevent this, among other inconveniences ,
the civil law ordained that
no widow should marry infra
annum
luctus ( e) , and we find it established
under
the
Saxon and Danish governments , that she should not marry
within twelve months after her husband's
death (ƒ) .
As bastards
may be born
before the coverture or mar-
riage
state
is begun , or after it is
determined ,
so also
children
born during wedlock
may in some circumstances
be bastards .
As if the husband be out of the kingdom of
England (or ,

somewhat
loosely
phrases it,

But, generally
during the coverture , access of the husband
is presumed , unless the
contrary
be shown .
This was
formerly
held such a negative
as could only be proved by
showing
him to

the
general
rule
being

legitimatione ;
but the old doctrine of the

since exploded (h) , and the child
will now be considered illegitimate if he be born
under
such circumstances as make it impossible that his mother's
husband could
have begotten him , whether this
impossi-
bility arise from non-access , physical
infirmity , or other
cause (i) ; but the presumption
of legitimacy
still
holds
to this extent , that if the husband
have any opportunity
of sexual
access
during
the natural
period of gestation ,
the child will be considered legitimate , though there may
be the strongest
reason for supposing it the offspring of
an adulterer , the question for a jury in such a case always
being , not whether the husband be the father , but whether
he could have been such (k).

is that their bastard
of maintenance .
For though bastards are not looked upon
as children for any civil purposes , yet the ties of nature , of
which maintenance is one , are not so easily dissolved : and
they hold indeed for some other purposes ; as , for instance ,
a man
cannot
marry his
bastard sister or
daughter (n) .
The civil law, therefore , when it denied maintenance
to
bastards begotten under certain atrocious circumstances (o) ,
was neither
consonant to nature
nor
reason ;
however
profligate and wicked
the parents might justly have been
esteemed.
The method in which
the English law provides main-
tenance for bastards is
as follows .
Prior to
or within
twelve months (p) after the birth of an illegitimate
child ,
the mother , who is
primarily
liable
to support it (q) , may ,

next to the rights and incapacities which
appertain to a bastard .
The
rights
are very few, being
only such as he can acquire ; for he can inherit nothing
( u) ,
being looked upon as the son of nobody , nullius filius (x).
Yet
a bastard
may gain a
surname by reputation (y) ,
though he has none by inheritance , being entitled
neither
to that of his father or his mother .
It was formerly held
that he could only have a birth settlement , but as we have
already seen , he is now entitled to that of his mother until
he attains the age of sixteen (z).
The incapacity of a bastard consists indeed principally in
this , that he cannot be heir to any one , neither can he have
heirs , but of his own body ; for being
nullius filius , he is
of kin to nobody , and
has
no ancestor from
whom
any
inheritable
blood
can be
derived .
A
bastard
was
also
formerly
held , in strictness , incapable of holy orders
; and
when that was dispensed with , he was still long considered
disqualified
to
hold
any dignity in the church (a) ; but
this doctrine seems now altogether obsolete ;
and in most
other respects there is no distinction
between a bastard and
another
man ( ) .
And really any other distinction

THE
STUDY
OF THE
LAW .
COMMENTARIES
on the Laws of England may properly
commence with some general exhortation
to the study of
our law , and some specific reasons why that study should
be cultivated .
A law is an ordinance
dictated
by some power which
can enforce obedience to its will (a) .
A complete body
of laws professes to be adapted, or to be capable of adapta-
tion , to every case calling for the interposition
of justice
which can arise within the limits of the country where it
obtains .
Legal principles
therefore
do not
change
or
vary in subservience to the fashion of the times , though
they are flexible and accommodate themselves to new facts
which could
not have been within the contemplation
of
those who originated
and propounded them .

THE
STUDY
OF THE LAW.
Importance
of a know-
ledge of
law to all
classes:
are uniform , in a much greater degree , at all
events , than
may popularly
be supposed.
A mere statement of the foregoing propositions might
suffice to
show
that law is the science which regulates
our social system , which ensures
its
stability
and cohe-
sion , which affords to each member of the commonwealth
a due protection .
Law , in
short , is the
science
which
maintains
an
equilibrium
between
the
different
social
forces, each
of which
being
placed under
subjection
to
the law is made to act harmoniously
with its fellows .
To demonstrate
still
further
the utility of some ac-
quaintance with our laws to all classes of the community ,
the following
reflections may be offered .
Political
or civil liberty rightly understood consists in
the power of doing
whatsoever
the laws
permit (b ) ; it
can only exist in virtue
of a general
conformity
by all
orders and degrees
to those equitable
rules of action , by
which the meanest individual is protected from the in-
sults
and oppression of the greatest .
As therefore every
subject is interested
in the preservation
of the
laws , it
is incumbent
upon
every
man
to be acquainted with
those , at least , with which
he is
immediately
concerned ;
lest
he
incur
the
censure, as
well
as
inconvenience ,
of living
in society without
knowing the
obligations
which
it lays him under .
And thus
much
may suffice
for persons
of inferior
condition , who have neither
time.
nor
capacity to enlarge their views
beyond
that
con-
tracted
sphere in
which
they
are
appointed
to
move .
But those on whom
nature
and fortune
have bestowed
more
abilities
and
greater
leisure , cannot be
so
easily
excused .
These
advantages
are
given
them , for the
benefit not of themselves only , but
also of the
public
;
and yet they cannot , in any scene
of life , discharge pro-
perly their
duty
either to the public
or to themselves ,

strange
absurdity .
Landed
property , with its long and
voluminous
train
of
descents
and
conveyances

ments ,

and
incumbrances ,

and extensive branch
of legal
knowledge
; the thorough comprehension of this , with all
its minute

for any but a lawyer

understanding
of a few leading
principles ,
relating
to

and
conveyancing , to the forms
of
leases
and
agreements
may form
some check
and guard upon the
inferior agents of a landed proprietor , and preserve him ,
at least , from very gross and notorious impositions .
Again , the policy
of our law has
made some forms to testators,

of wills , and in the manner of
attesting

consideration .
A very large
portion
of the com-
munity are liable to be called upon to establish the rights ,
to estimate the
injuries of their fellow - subjects , to weigh
the accusations
against
them , and sometimes to dispose
of their
lives , by serving
upon juries.
Persons
in this
responsible
situation
are
frequently
obliged
to
decide ,
upon
their
oaths , questions
of nice
importance , in the
solution of which
some legal skill
is requisite ; especially
where
law and fact ,
as
often
happens ,
are
intimately
blended together .
And the
incapacity
to do this with
propriety , tends
to diminish the credit
and authority
of
juries , and
has , perhaps , thrown
more power
into the
hands of the judges
to direct , control , and
even
reverse
their verdicts , than by the constitution
was intended .
For
one placed in the
commission
of the
peace
an
ample field is open to exert his talents by maintaining
good order in his neighbourhood
; by punishing
the dis-
solute and
idle ;
by protecting
the
peaceable
and
in-
dustrious ;
and ,
above
all , by healing
petty
differences ,
and preventing vexatious
prosecutions .
But , in order to
attain these desirable ends , it is necessary
that the magis-
trate should
understand
his business ; and have not only
the will , but the power also , by possessing the required
knowledge , to
administer
justice .
Else , when
he
has
mistaken
his
authority , through
passion , through
igno-
rance , or
carelessness
, he will incur
contempt from his
inferiors , and censure from those to whom he is account-
able for his conduct .
Yet further
many gentlemen of property , position , or

some
period
or
other of life, are desirous of

are ambitious of receiving so high a trust , would
do well
to remember its nature
and importance .

; but , upon
con-
siderations
far
more
interesting
and
important .
They
are
the
guardians
of the
English
constitution
;
the
makers , repealers , and in some sense
interpreters
of the
English laws ; delegated to watch , to check , and to avert,
every dangerous
innovation , to propose, to
adopt, and to
cherish any solid and well -weighed
improvement ; bound
by every tie of nature , of honour ,
and
of
religion ,
to
transmit that
constitution
and those laws
to their
pos-
terity , amended if possible , at least without
any deroga-
tion .
And how unbecoming must it appear in a member
of the
legislature
to vote for a new law who is utterly
ignorant of the old ! what kind of interpretation
can he
be enabled
to give , who is a stranger
to the text upon
which he comments !
Indeed , it is amazing that to the
science
of legislation ,
the noblest and most difficult of all
sciences , no prelimi-
nary method of instruction
is looked
upon
as
requisite .
Apprenticeships
are held
necessary to almost
every art ,
commercial or mechanical
; a long course of reading and
study must form
the divine , the physician , the practical
professor of the laws : but many a man of superior fortune
thinks himself born
a legislator .
The
great
Roman
orator (d) , however , was of a different
opinion : " It is
necessary (says
he ) for a senator
to be thoroughly
ac-
quainted with the constitution
; and this (he declares ) is
a knowledge
of the most
extensive nature ; a matter of
science, of diligence ,
of reflection ;
without
which
no
senator can possibly be fit for his office."
The
mischiefs
that have arisen to the public from in-
considerate alterations
in our
laws , are too
obvious to be
called in question : and how far they have been owing to
the
defective
education of our
senators , is a point well
worthy of attention .
The
common law of England has

fared like other venerable edifices of antiquity , which rash
and inexperienced
workmen
have ventured
to new -dress
and
refine , with all the
rage of modern
improvement .
Hence
frequently
its
symmetry
has
been
destroyed
,
its
proportions distorted
,
and its majestic simplicity exchanged
for specious embellishments
and fantastic novelties
.
For
,
to
say the truth
,
almost all the perplexed questions
,
almost
all the niceties
,
intricacies
,
and delays
(
which have some-
times
disgraced
our courts
of
justice
),
owe their
origin
not
so
much
to
the common law itself
,
as
to
innovations
that have been made
in
it
by acts
of
parliament
;
"
over-
laden
(
as
sir Edward
Coke
expresses
it
(e))
with pro-
visoes and additions
,
and many times on
a
sudden penned
or
corrected by men
of
none
,
or
very little judgment
in
law
."
This
great
and
well
-
experienced
judge
further
declares
(ƒ
),
that
"
the greatest questions arise not upon
any
of
the rules
of
the common
(
i.e.
,
unwritten
)
law
;"
and
warmly laments
the confusion
introduced by
ill
-
judging
and unlearned
legislators
.
But
"
if,"
he subjoins
,
"
acts
of
parliament
were after the old fashion penned
,
by such
only
as
perfectly knew what the common law was before
the
making
of
any
act
of
parliament
concerning
that
matter
,
as
also how far forth former statutes had provided
remedy for former
mischiefs
,
and
defects
discovered by
experience
;
then
should very few questions
in
law arise
,
and the learned should not
so
often and
so
much perplex
their heads
to
make atonement and peace
,
by construction
of law
,
between insensible
and
disagreeing
words
,
sen-
tences
,
and
provisoes
,
as
they
now
do
."
And
if
this
inconvenience was
so
heavily
felt
in
the reign
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
how
must
the evil
have
increased
in
later
times
,
when the statute

book
is
swelled
to
a
vastly larger
bulk
;
unless
,
indeed
,
it
should
be
found

that

What has been said of our commoners in general , and to
the
no-
the propriety
of
their applying themselves
to
the study
of
our laws
,
will hold
equally
,
or
still more
strongly
,
with
regard
to
the nobility
of
this realm
,
except only
in
the
article
of
serving
upon juries
.
But
,
in
lieu
of
this
,
they
have
peculiar
provinces
of
far
greater
consequence
and
concern
;
being
by birth
hereditary
counsellors
of
the
crown
,
and
judges
upon their honour
as
well
of
great
political offenders
as
of
their brother
-
peers
.
Onerous
as
this trust
is,
it
can no where be
so
properly reposed
,
as
in
the
noble
hands
where
our
excellent
constitution
has
placed
it;
and assuredly
it
behoves
the members of our
Upper House
,
from the independence
of
fortune
and dig-
nity
of
station which
they enjoy
,
to
employ that leisure
which
is
a
consequence
of
both
,
in
attaining
a
more ex-
tensive knowledge
of
the laws
,
than for persons
of
inferior
rank may be essential
.
The Roman
pandects will furnish
us
with
a
piece
of
history not inapplicable
to
our present purpose
.
Servius
Sulpicius
,
a
gentleman
of
the patrician
order
,
and
a
cele-
brated orator
,
had occasion
to
take the opinion
of
Quintus
Mutius Scævola
,
the then oracle
of
the Roman law
;
but
,
for want of some knowledge
in
that science
,
could not
so
much
as
understand
even the technical terms
,
which his
friend was obliged
to
make use
of
.
Whereupon
,
Mutius
Scævola
could
not
forbear
to
upbraid
him with this
memorable reproof
(g),
"
that
it
was
a
shame for
a
patri-
cian
,
a
nobleman
,
and an orator
of
causes
,
to
be ignorant
of
that law
in
which
he was
so
peculiarly
concerned
."
This reproach
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
Sulpicius
,
that he immediately
applied himself
to
the
study
of
the
law
;
wherein
he attained
to
such proficiency
,
that he left
behind him about
a
hundred and fourscore volumes of his
own compiling
upon
the
subject
;
and
became

opinion of Cicero (h), a much more complete lawyer
than
even Mutius
Scævola himself .
I would
not be thought
to recommend to our English
nobility and gentry , to become as great lawyers
as Sul-
picius ; though
he , together with this character , sustained
likewise that of an excellent
orator , a firm patriot , and a
wise, indefatigable
senator ; but the inference which arises
from the story is this , that ignorance
of the
laws of the
land has ever been
esteemed
dishonourable
in those , who
are intrusted by their country to maintain , to administer ,
and to amend them .
Nor will some amount of legal knowledge
be found in
the least superfluous
for
professional
persons though
of
inferior
degree .
The clergy , in particular , have abundant
reason to be acquainted with many branches of the law,
which are almost peculiar and appropriated
to themselves
alone.
Such are the laws relating to advowsons , institu-
tions , and
inductions
;
to simony , and
simoniacal
con-
tracts ; to residence
and pluralities
; to church -rates ; to
tithes , and other ecclesiastical
dues ; to marriage , and to
various
religious
observances
which are
consigned
to the
care of their
order, yet
attract
in no slight degree
the
attention , and awaken the interest of the laity.
To under-
stand
these
aright ,
to
discern
what
is
warranted
or
enjoined , and what is forbidden
by law, demands a sort of
legal apprehension
; which is no otherwise to be acquired ,
than
by use , and by a familiar acquaintance with legal
writers .
The
science of medical jurisprudence
has of late years
attained to especial
prominence and importance ; inasmuch
also as the evidence
of skilled witnesses is justly deemed
entitled to much weight ; some general acquaintance with
legal
principles ,
and the nature of criminal offences , is
suggested for those
professing
the faculty
of physic
as
desirable and useful .

officers.
A word
as to
purely
judicial
officers
will of course to judicial
suffice .
Should
a judge in the most subordinate jurisdic-
tion be deficient in knowledge of the law, it would reflect
disgrace upon himself, as well as upon those who appointed
him , and yet the
consequence
of his ignorance
might
be
comparatively
trifling :
his
judgment ,
moreover , might
sometimes
be examined , and
his
errors
be rectified , by
other courts .
But , how much
more
serious
and affecting
would
be the case of a superior judge , if without
com-
petent skill in the laws he should boldly venture to decide
a question upon which the welfare and subsistence of whole
families
might depend ! where the chance of his judging
right or wrong , is barely equal ; and where , if he
chances
to judge wrong , he does
an injury of the most alarming
nature , an injury perhaps without
possibility
of redress .
A judge ought , moreover , not only
to decide correctly ,
but to give
correct reasons for his decision , so that , the
grounds on which it rested being understood , the judgment
itself may afterwards be confidently applied (i) .
(i) In Wilkes's
case,
19
St.
Tr .
1098, Lord
Mansfield
observed :—
" It is not only a justice
due to the
Crown
and
the
party in
every
criminal cause where
doubts
arise
to weigh
well
the
grounds
and
reasons of the judgment , but it is
of great
consequence
to
explain
them with
accuracy
and
precision
in
open
court ,
especially if the
questions be of a general tendency ,
and upon
topics never before fully
considered
and
settled- that
the
criminal law of the
land may
be
certain and known ."
It was indeed
affirmed by no less
considerable
a
judge
than
Lord
Hardwicke
that
courts
neither
of
equity
nor of law
are
obliged
to
give
reasons for their
judgments
(Gregory
v.

but
this
idea, which
was
never
much
acted upon , has long
since been exploded , and not
a few
recent judgments
might
confidently
be appealed to as models
of logical
reasoning ,
of
methodical
arrange-
ment , of learned
and luminous

THE
STUDY
OF
THE
LAW.
Causesof
the neglect
Admitting
that a knowledge of our laws is , for most of
of
the
study our fellow
-
countrymen
,
desirable
,
and for some essential
,
the
a
brief inquiry
may
be
proper
why
legal
studies
,
now
happily
reviving
,
fell
,
during
a
long period
,
into disrepute
and neglect amongst us
.
Sir John
Fortescue
,
in
his panegyric
on
the
laws
of
England
(k)
(
written
in
the
reign
of
Henry VI
.),
puts
a
very obvious question
in
the mouth
of
the young
prince
,
whom he
is
exhorting
to
apply himself
to
that
branch
of
learning
:
-
"
why the
laws
of
England
,
being
so
good
,
so
fruitful
,
and
so
commodious
,
are not taught
in the universities
,
as
the
civil
and
canon laws
are
?"
In answer
to
which
he gives
(1)
what
seems
,
with due
deference
be
it
spoken
,
a
very jejune
and unsatisfactory
reason
;
being
,
in
short
,
that
"
as
the
proceedings
at
common
law were
,
in
his
time
,
carried
on
in
three
different tongues
,
the English
,
the Latin
,
and the French
,
that
science
must
be necessarily
taught
in
those three
several
languages
;
but that
in
the universities
,
all sciences
were taught
in
the Latin tongue only
;"

It became endeared
to the people
in general , as well because
its
decisions were universally
known, as because it was found to be excellently
adapted
to the genius of the English
nation (n) .
In the know-
ledge of this law consisted great part of the learning of
the dark ages ; it was taught , says
Mr.
Selden (0) , in the
monasteries , in the universities , and in the families of the
principal nobility.
The clergy , in particular , as they then.
engrossed almost every other branch of learning , so (like
their predecessors
the British Druids (p) ) were they pecu-
liarly remarkable
for their
proficiency in the study of the
law.
Nullus clericus nisi causidicus, is the character given
of them soon after the conquest by William of Malmes-
bury (q) .
The judges , therefore , were usually
created
out
of the
sacred
order
(r) , as was likewise
the
case
among
the Normans
(8) ; and all the inferior
legal offices
were
filled
by the lower
clergy ,
which
has occasioned their
successors
to be denominated " clerks " to this day.

who pre-
ferred the
civil law,
its authority remained in Italy (x) and the
eastern pro-
vinces of the empire (y).
It now became
in a particular
manner
the favourite of the popish
clergy , who borrowed
the
method
and many of the
maxims of the canon law
from this original .
The study of it was introduced
into
several
universities
abroad , particularly
that of Bologna ,
where exercises
were performed , lectures read , and
degrees
conferred in this faculty , as in other branches of science
;
and many nations
on the continent , just
then beginning
to recover from the convulsions consequent upon the over-
throw of the Roman empire , and settling by degrees
into
peaceable
forms of government , adopted
the
civil
law
(being the best written
system then extant ) , as the basis
of their several constitutions
; blending
and interweaving
it among their own feudal customs , with, in some
places ,
a more extensive , in others a more confined authority (≈) .
Nor was it long before the prevailing
mode of the times
reached England .
For Theobald , a Norman
abbot , being
elected
to the see of Canterbury (a) , and extremely ad-
dicted to this
new study , brought
over with him in his
retinue many learned proficients
therein ; and among the
rest Roger
surnamed
Vacarius , whom
he placed in the
university
of Oxford (b) , to teach it to the people of this
country .
But it did not meet with the same
easy recep-
tion in England, where a comparatively mild and rational
system of laws had been long established , as it did upon
the continent ; and though the monkish
clergy (devoted to
the will of a foreign primate )
received it with eagerness
and zeal , yet the laity, who were more interested to pre-
serve the old constitution , and had already
severely felt
the effect of many Norman innovations , continued wedded
to the use of the common law.

adhered

equal
pertinacity

law ; both of them
reciprocally jealous of what
they
were unacquainted
with , and neither of them , per-
haps , allowing
the
opposite system that real merit which
is abundantly to be found in each .
This may appear , on
the one hand , from the spleen with which the monastic
writers (e) speak of our municipal
laws , and, on the other ,
from the firm temper which the
nobility showed at the
famous
parliament of Merton , when the prelates
endea-
voured to procure an act , to declare
all bastards legitimate
in case the parents intermarried , alleging this only reason ,
because holy church (that is, the canon law ) declared such
children legitimate
; but " all the earls and barons (says
the parliament roll (ƒ) ) , with one voice answered, that they
would not change the laws of England which had hitherto
been used and approved ." And we find the same jealousy
prevailing above a century afterwards

realm of England hath never been unto this hour , neither
by the consent of our lord the king , and the lords of par-
liament , shall it
ever be , ruled
or governed by the civil
law" (h).
And of this temper
between the
clergy
and
laity many more instances might be given (¿).
While things were in this situation , the clergy , finding
the clergy it impossible
to
root
out
the
municipal
law, began
to
withdraw themselves by degrees
from the temporal courts ;
and to that
end , very early in the reign of king Henry
III. , episcopal
constitutions
were published
(k) , forbid-
ding ecclesiastics to appear as advocates
in foro sæculari;
nor did they long
continue
to act
as judges
there ,
not
caring
to take
the
oath of office which was then
found
necessary to be
administered , that
they
should
in all
things determine according to the law and custom of this
realm ( ) ; though
they still
kept possession of the high
office of chancellor
; an office then of little juridical power ;
and afterwards , as its business increased by degrees , they
modelled the process
of his court at their own discretion .
But wherever they retired , and wherever their authority
despisedby extended , they carried with them the same zeal to introduce
the rules of the civil, in exclusion of the municipal
law.
This appears in a particular manner from the spiritual courts
of all denominations , from the
chancellor's
court at the
university
of Cambridge , and from the court of chancery
before mentioned ; in all of which
the proceedings are to
this day in a course much conformed to the civil law : for
which
no tolerable
reason
can be assigned , unless that
these courts
were all under the immediate
direction
of
the popish
ecclesiastics , among
whom it was a point of
religion
to exclude the municipal
law ; Pope Innocent IV.

it, in the most public manner .
After the withdrawal
, in-
deed , of the clergy from practice in the temporal
courts ,
the common
lawyers
made a firm and successful opposi-
tion to the efforts of the Anglican hierarchy to free them-
selves
from the control
of the law.
This is shown at
various epochs of our history .
Before the Reformation
the papal clergy had two prin-
cipal objects in view , the withdrawal
of spiritual
persons
from lay jurisdiction ; and the acquisition of an exclusive
jurisdiction for the spiritual courts over " divine matters ."
Their struggles
for the former were nipped in the bud by
the Constitutions
of Clarendon , whilst the writ of pro-
hibition checked
every
successive
attempt to seize
upon
the latter .
In order to free himself from the control of
this writ , Archbishop
Boniface
struggled
vehemently in
the reign of Henry III . , fairly trying his strength against
that of the courts of
common law, by threatening
the
judges ofthose courts with excommunication if they should
dare to issue prohibitions
on the matters
specified in his
articuli cleri .
Yet , says Lord
Coke (p) , notwithstanding
the
greatness of the archbishop ,
and
that
divers of the
judges and all the great officers of state were clergy , the
judges
proceeded according
to the laws of the
realm ,
and still kept , though with great difficulty , the ecclesias-
tical courts within
their just and proper limits .
At the
Reformation
the
contending
parties
came
to issue in
the parliament
held in the 21st year of Henry VIII . , on
the abuses of the church .
In that
parliament
three bills
were sent up to the lords from the commons , one against
unreasonable
exactions of fees
for the
probate of wills ,

another
against
mortuaries ,
and
the third
to
restrain
pluralities and non -residence, to forbid the clergy taking
farms ,
&c. , and
to
confine them to a due discharge of
their
functions .
These
bills
having
eventually
been
passed (9), were, after
a long
interval , followed
up by
enactments against appeals to Rome (r) , for the submis-
sion of the clergy ( s) , against
payment of first fruits to
the pope ,
and for the
election
of
bishops (t), against
Peter's
pence and dispensations (u) , for the king's supre-
macy (x), for the suppression of the lesser monasteries (y),
for extinguishing
the authority
of the pope
(~) , and for
the total suppression of the monasteries (a).
Even during the reign of Elizabeth , the animosity
be-
tween the lawyers and the clergy
was not
entirely
dor-
mant
(b) , and no
sooner
had
James I.
ascended
the
throne , than we find the prelates renewing their claims to
a jurisdiction beyond the control of the courts of common
law, and making
especial remonstrance against the use of
the writ of prohibition
.
The exact nature of these eccle-
siastical
demands will be learned
from a survey of the
canons of 1603
(c) , and the articuli
cleri of Archbishop
Bancroft
(d) in the same year .
The successful opposition
made by the judges
to the
pretensions of Bancroft
only
served to exasperate both parties , and to aggravate that
jealousy
of the
ecclesiastical
courts ,
which
the common
lawyers had long
entertained (e) .
But the supremacy of
the legal over the
ecclesiastical
power was shortly after
this period finally established .

common
in one spot.
The court of
In the thirteenth
century an incident had occurred which
pleasfixed
greatly tended to the support of our
common law.
This
incident
was the fixing the court of common
pleas ,
the
grand
tribunal
for
disputes
concerning
property , in one
certain spot ; that the
seat of ordinary justice might be
permanent
and
notorious to all the
nation .
This
court
had previously
been held before the king's chief justiciary
of England ,
in the
aula
regis, or such of his
palaces
wherein his royal person resided ;
and had removed with
his household
from
one end of the kingdom
to the other .
This was found
to
occasion
great
inconvenience to the
suitors ; to remedy which it was made an article of the
great charter of liberties , both that of king John and that
of king Henry III.
(ƒ) ,
that " common
pleas
should
no
longer
follow the king's court , but be held in some
certain
place : " in
consequence
of which
they have ever
since been held (a few necessary removals in times of
sickness
excepted ) in the
palace of
Westminster
only .
This
brought
together
the
professors of the municipal
law, who
before were dispersed about the kingdom , and
formed them into an aggregate body ; whereby a society

(as
Spelman (g)

serves ) , addicting
themselves wholly to the study of the
laws of the land , and no longer
considering it as a mere

science , for the

raised those laws

exercises were performed , lectures read, and

were those

The sons of
In this juridical
university
(for such it is insisted to
and gentry
have
been
by Fortescue (q) and sir Edward
Coke (r) )
there were two
sorts
of
collegiate
houses
;
one
called
inns of chancery , in which the younger
students of the
law were usually
placed , " learning
and studying ," says
Fortescue (s), " the
originals ,
and
as it were the ele-
ments of the law ; who , profiting
therein ,
as they grew
to ripeness , so
were they admitted
into the greater inns
of the
same study ,
called
the inns of court ."
And in
these
inns
of both kinds, he
goes
on
to tell
us , the
knights and barons , with other grandees and noblemen of
the realm , did use to place their children , though they did
not desire to have them thoroughly
learned in the law , or
to get their living by its practice : so that in his time there
were about two thousand
students at the several
inns , all
of whom
he informs
us were filii nobilium , or gentlemen
born .
Hence it is evident , that though under the influence of
the monks
our
universities
neglected
this
study , yet in
the time of Henry VI. it was thought
highly necessary,
and was the universal practice , for the young nobility and
gentry to be instructed
in the elements of our laws .
By
degrees , however , this custom unfortunately
fell into dis-
use; so that in the reign of queen Elizabeth
sir Edward
Coke (t) does
not reckon
above a thousand
students for

the bar, and the number
at present is very considerably
less .
Yet although many of such as are admitted
to the
degree of barrister
neither
intend
to
practise
nor
have
qualified
themselves
to do
so , the requirements
of the
public in regard to this learned
profession have doubtless
during recent years been more than adequately supplied .
The privilege of calling
to the bar is (subject to limi-
tations
below
indicated (u) )
vested
in
the
benchers or
governing
body of each of the four inns of court ; and by
these societies has recently been framed and brought into
operation
a curriculum
of legal
education ,
the
outlines
whereof
are sufficiently
set forth in the Appendix (x).
From the
introduction
and establishment of this
system
solid advantages have flowed , and it is satisfactory to add,
that legal studies are now , through
the wisdom
of col-
legiate
preceptors
and the
beneficence of private
bene-
factors ,
gradually
receiving
in
our
great
universities
attention
and encouragement in
some
degree commen-
surate with their value .
Without
at all insisting upon
academical
education
as an indispensable
preliminary
to
entering
the profession of the law , or even
upon making
the
rudiments
of law
a
necessary
part
of academical
education , we need not scruple to affirm that
sciences

the
decision
of the
Benchers
be adverse , the
applicant
may appeal to the Judges , who will
determine
whether
the grounds
of
rejection
assigned
are
or
are
not
sufficient .
In The King v. The
Benchers of
Lincoln's Inn, 4
B. & C. 855, the
Court
of Queen's
Bench
refused
a
mandamus ,
and
the
judges
also
refused to interfere , as visitors , to
compel the admission
of a student ;
but with respect to the
call
to the
bar , Mr. Justice Littledale
said that
" a member
who has been suffered
to
incur
expense with a view
to
being called to the bar, thereby
ac-
quires an inchoate right to be called ,
and if the benchers
refuse to call
him , they ought to assign
a reason
for
so doing ;
and if there
be no
reason , or an insufficient
one, then
the member , who has acquired
such
inchoate
right, is entitled
to have
that right perfected ."
The benchers
claim ,
and
have
occasionally
exercised , the power to
disbar members after they have been
called to the degree of barrister -at-
law.

best in the neigh-
bourhood
of
each
other :
that
there
is
no
branch
of
learning
but may be helped and improved by assistance
drawn from other arts .
If, therefore , the student of our
laws
has polished
and matured
his style , by perusal and
imitation of the purest classical writers , among whom the
historians
and orators will best deserve
his regard ; if he
can reason with precision ,
and separate argument
from
fallacy , by the clear simple rules of unsophisticated
logic ;
if, disciplined
by abstract
mathematical
demonstrations ,
he can fix his attention and steadily pursue truth through
any the most
intricate
deduction ; if he has enlarged his
conceptions of nature
and art , by a view of the several
branches of genuine
experimental
philosophy
; if he has
impressed on his mind
the sound maxims of the law of
nature , the best and most authentic foundation of human
laws ; if, lastly,
he
has
contemplated
those
maxims
reduced to a practical
system in the
laws
of
imperial
Rome ; if he has done this , or any material
part of it , a
student thus
qualified
may enter upon the
study of the
law with incredible advantage and reputation . If, indeed ,
during
the acquisition of these
accomplishments , he can
afford himself leisure at the university , to lay the founda-
tion of his
future
labours in a solid
scientifical
method ,
without
thirsting too early to attend that practice which
it would be impossible
he should rightly comprehend , he
will
afterwards
proceed
with the greater
ease , and will
unfold the most intricate points with an intuitive
sagacity
and clearness
.
With reference to the mode of pursuing
legal studies , a
few remarks- 1st ,
general ,
2ndly ,
practical ,
in
their
nature , are subjoined .
First may be urged upon the student the supreme im-
portance of method (y) in studying our law.

should be stretched , as it were, a map indicating
the shape
of the country to be explored , its connexions
and
boun-
daries , its greater divisions and
principal
cities ; it is not
indeed for the student to describe minutely its subordinate .
limits , or to fix the longitude
and latitude of every incon-
siderable hamlet in it.
His attention should be engaged,
like that of the students mentioned by Fortescue (~) "in
tracing
out the originals , and , as it were, the elements of
the law. "
For if, as Justinian (a ) has observed
, the tender
understanding
of the student be loaded at the first with a
multitude and variety
of matter , it will either
occasion
him to desert his studies , or will carry him heavily through
them , with much labour , delay , and despondence
.
These
originals
should
be traced to their fountains , as well
as
our distance will permit ; to the customs of the Britons
and Germans , as recorded
by Cæsar and Tacitus
; to the
codes of the northern
continental
nations , or to those of
our own Saxon princes ; to the rules of the Roman law,
either left here in the days of Papinian
, or imported by
Vacarius
and his followers : but above all to that
inex-
ways the weight
or novelty
of his
remarks ; not always the interest of
the facts which he communicates ,
or the peculiarity of his words
and
phrases ; but " the true
cause
of
the impression
made upon us is that
his mind is methodical ."
Through-
out what he says is manifest
some
leading
and
definite
idea , is mani-
fest distinctness
of mental vision , a
power of foreseeing at the beginning
of every
sentence
how it is to end ,
and how
all
its parts may
be
brought
out in the best and
most
orderly
succession
.
These
are
suggestive
words
,
which should
impress them-
selves
on the mind
of
every
one
who would aspire
to
excellence
as
an
advocate
,
or
who
would
aim
at
achieving
reputation
on
the
bench
or in

THE
STUDY
OF THE LAW.
haustible
reservoir of legal
antiquities
and learning , the
feudal law, or , as Spelman (6) has
entitled it , the law of
nations in our
western
orb .
These primary
rules
and
fundamental
principles
should be weighed
and compared
with the precepts of the law of nature and of nations , and
when possible with the practice of other countries ; should
be explained by reasons , illustrated
by examples , and con-
firmed by undoubted
authorities
; their history
should be
deduced, their changes and revolutions
observed
; and it
should be shewn how far they are connected
with , or have
at any time been affected
by, the civil transactions of the
kingdom .
To one who thus addresses
himself to legal studies , who
searches
for
correct
and
wholesome law at the
sources
whence it may be drawn ,
certain
difficulties
calculated
much to retard , if not wholly to arrest his progress , may
present themselves .
Law is a technical
science , so that
in
developing
and
applying
it,
technical
words
and
phrases are employed , with the full significance of which
familiarity must
gradually
be
acquired by reading
law
treatises and reported cases , by the study of pleading , and
by observing the practice of our courts (c).
The desirableness of studying
decided cases will appear
from a remark of Best , C. J. (d) , that " the judgments
of
the Courts
of Westminster
Hall are the
only
authority
that we have for by far the greatest
part of the law of
England," i.e. , of the customary or unwritten
law.
The
decision of
a
court
must
be regarded
as
the
answer
solemnly given by it to a question raised between parties ,

peculiar
process as may be allowed , and it may conse-
quently well be that the prodigious
series
of decisions
noted up by the reporters really does constitute or authen-
ticate
by far the greater portion
of our unwritten
law.
These cases range over and apply themselves
to an almost
infinite variety of subjects , and it is interesting
to notice
how from time to time the drift of decisions has changed
in accordance with the change of system, with the advance
of civilisation -with social progress .
The earlier volumes
of our
reports , including the series of Year
Books
(e) ,
contain for the most part decisions
throwing
light
upon
the feudal tenures-upon real
actions-upon
direct
torts
to land, to chattels , to the person .
In these volumes are
also to be met with some curious
cases
upon
pleading .
To the Year
Books
and
earlier
reports , however ,
we
might vainly look for
authorities
concerning
mercantile
transactions , or (save
only where
torts
simple
in their
nature
are involved )
concerning
chattel
property .
For
some centuries , indeed , after the Conquest , personalty was
little cared for , and those engaged in mercantile pursuits
were little
regarded or
protected by the law ; it was not ,
as
observed by a learned
writer (f) , till the
reign
of
Henry VII.
that
the
advantages
arising
from
our in-
sular position and internal
resources began to
be
deve-
loped
or
brought
into
active
operation .
In
Magna
Carta , doubtless , as ratified by Henry III. , are contained
divers
provisions ,
having
direct
reference
to the law
merchant , and evidently designed to benefit and encourage
trade ; provisions
for insuring
uniformity in the measures
used for the sale of various commodities throughout
the
realm , and for guaranteeing
to foreign
merchants
safe
conduct in this country .
Nevertheless
we might vainly
search our earliest legal chronicles for precedents respect-
ing
mercantile
transactions .

ever, of the 15th century , personal property was gradually

THE STUDY
OF
THE
LAW.
attracting
to
itself
consideration ,
and ,
owing
to
the
increase of trade
and manufactures , was becoming more
and more a subject of discussion in our courts , so that
lawyers were compelled to bestow upon it some share of
their attention , which
seems
before to have
been wholly
engrossed by the learning of real property (g).
From A.D.
1500, until the time when Lord Mansfield presided over the
King's
Bench (h) , many
and not unimportant
reported
cases
are to be found touching the law of contracts .
It
is, however , to the great judge just named that we must
look for an exposition
of the doctrines of our law mer-
chant , and assuredly without
definite rules governing
this
department of our law, the law of contracts itself could
not be said to have far advanced towards
its maturity .
During Lord Mansfield's
long judicial career, our reports
evidence
the
rapidly
increasing
estimation
in
which
commerce and commercial dealings were held amongst us.
There are to be found enunciated principles , often founded
on considerations
of mercantile
convenience, which
have
since been repeatedly recognised as sound .
And although
the body of our Lex Mercatoria has been immensely
added
to since Lord Mansfield's
time , as well by legislative
enact-
ments as by the recorded judgments ofour courts , the hand
which laid the foundations
of this vast structure was
his
alone , and his the genius which designed and amplified its
outlines .
It would
be easy
to show that during the last
three-quarters of a century the character of our reported
cases has materially
changed , that
their
character is still
changing .
And hence the branch of study recommended
is to a great
degree
relieved of monotony , and , if carried
out on a judicious
and comprehensive
plan , will give no
little
insight
into
the
manners
and
customs
of
our
ancestors , as well
as into the history of our country , for
some of the remarkable features of that history
are
to be
found depicted in the reports
as they are depicted in the
Statute Book.

2ndly. The plan of these commentaries forbids an ela-
borate enquiry respecting the course of study proper for a
practitioner
of law (i) ; a few remarks , however , as to the
reading of reported cases may not be deemed
superfluous .
Obviously
the difference is great between so reading cases
as to apprehend
merely the isolated
points
decided in
them ,
and
so
reading
cases
as to extract
out of them
principles , and to acquire that peculiar power of analysing
facts , and
that peculiar
mode of thought
which to the
accomplished
lawyer
are habitual .
The faculty of gene-
ralising is indeed of difficult
attainment .
To
generalise
from
decided
cases
we
must
understand
correctly
the
ground of each of the
decisions
before us, and we must
ever keep in mind this golden dictum (k) :-" The reason
and spirit of cases make law-not the letter of particular
precedents "—so that a knowledge of principles
and cases
may, and
ought
to
be , simultaneously
acquired .
Prin-
ciples
are
evidenced
and
illustrated
by
cases .
Cases
which
may at first sight appear discordant , become
har-
monious
and reconcilable with one
another
by reference
to established principles ( ).
Two plans have been suggested-the one by the illus-
trious
Lord
Bacon -- the
other
by an
eminent
modern
author (m)—whereby familiarity with decided cases may

the
question
raised
being
whether
a particular
contract
was
against law and void
upon the face
of it, Lord
Mansfield
remarked
as
follows :-" It is admitted
that the
contract is against no positive
law ;
it is admitted
that
there is no case
to be found which says it is illegal
;
but it is argued , and rightly , that ,
notwithstanding
it is not prohibited
by any
positive
law , nor
adjudged
illegal
by
any
precedents , yet
it
may be decided
to be so upon prin-
ciples ; and
the
law of
England
would
be a strange
science
indeed
if it were decided
upon
precedents
only .
Precedents
serve
to
illus-
trate principles , and to give them a
fixed
certainty .
But the law
of
England , which
is exclusive of posi-
tive law enacted by statute , depends
upon principles ."

THE
STUDY
OF THE LAW.
without
much
difficulty
be got .
In Lord
Bacon's
mind
the idea of associating cases with principles
predominated ,
and in his Treatise on the Maxims of our Law, a mode of
effecting this association is developed
.
In the preface to
that
treatise , he
tells
us that " there be two
contrary
faults
and extremities in the debating and sifting out of
the law , which may be best noted in two several manner
of arguments .
Some argue upon
general grounds , and
come not near the point in question ; others without lay-
ing any foundation of a ground
or difference do loosely
put
cases-which ,
though
they
go near the point yet,
being
put so scattered , prove
not , but rather
serve
to
make the law appear more doubtful
than to make it more
plain ."
That is to say-principles without cases are too
vague
and general
to serve unerringly as
guides ,
and
cases without
principles
lead but to perplexity
and doubt .
A different
plan
adopted by modern writers
has been
this
to select out of the reports
leading
cases
which
bear upon some branch
or department of the law, and of
which
each
involves , and is usually
cited to establish ,
a
point or principle
of real practical
importance .
And
in
order that
the
consequences
flowing
from
each
decision
may be understood , and its authority
may most
easily be
estimated , notes
are
appended
to the
principal
cases ,
containing
references
to subsequent decisions , and eluci-
dating
difficulties .
Thus , whilst
mainly
and primarily
directing
attention
to
cases , the writers
alluded
to take
such
opportunities
as
offer
of
expounding
principles ,
whereas Lord Bacon presents first the principle , and then
illustrates
and qualifies it by apt examples .
By
either
method
above
suggested
,
much
facility
is
afforded for acquiring
familiarity with the landmarks
of
our law- for acquiring , not merely a knowledge of cases ,
but knowledge
likewise
in regard
to their comparative
weight , authenticity , and importance .
It is satisfactory to reflect that when
once
the founda-
tion of such knowledge
has properly been laid, its super-

structure may with increasing
facility
be reared .
Nor
can time spent in learning
the
rudiments
of law be said
to
have
been
idly
and
unprofitably
spent .
For ,
even
should the idea of practising
in our law courts afterwards
be relinquished , an admirable
mental training will thus
have been gone through- conducing
to a logical precision
of thought- to accuracy of language , and to vigour of the
reasoning
faculty .
And besides these indirect
advantages
which
flow from
legal
studies , a knowledge of law is for
itself,
on
grounds
already
stated (n), to
be
desired .
" There is no jewel ," says sir E. Coke (0) , " in the world
comparable
to learning
; no learning
so excellent , both for
prince and subject , as knowledge of laws ; and no know-
ledge of any laws (I speak of human ) so necessary for all
estates , and for all causes
concerning goods , lands , or life ,
as the common laws of England."

CORPORATIONS ,
ETC.
WE have
hitherto
considered
persons in their
natural
capacities , and have treated of their
rights and duties .
But,
as
many
personal
rights die
altogether
with
the
person ;
and , as the necessary forms of investing
a series
of individuals
, one after another , with the same identical
rights would be very inconvenient , if not impracticable
;
it has been found necessary, when it is for the advantage
of the public to have particular
rights kept on foot and
continued , to constitute certain abstract bodies or artificial
persons , who
may
maintain
a perpetual
succession
, and
enjoy a kind of legal immortality
.
These artificial persons are called bodies politic , bodies
corporate (corpora corporata),
or corporations ; of which
there is a great variety subsisting , for the advancement of
religion , of learning , and of commerce ; in order to pre-
serve entire and for ever rights and immunities , which if,
they were granted only to those individuals
of which the
body corporate is composed , would
upon their death
be
utterly lost and extinct .
To show the advantages of these
incorporations , let us consider the case of a college in one
of our universities
, founded ad studendum
et orandum , for
the encouragement
and support of religion
and learning .
If this
were a mere voluntary
assembly , the individuals
which
compose
it might indeed read, pray , study , and
perform
scholastic
exercises
together
so long
as they
could
agree to do so : but they could neither frame , nor
receive any laws or rules for their conduct ; none at least ,

:
which would
have any binding
force , for want of a coer-
cive power
to
create
a
sufficient
obligation .
Neither
could they be capable of retaining
any privileges
or im-
munities
for if such privileges
should
be attacked , no
one individual
of all this
unconnected
assembly could
have the right , even if he had the ability , to defend them .
And , when
they
were dispersed by death
or otherwise ,
they could not transfer these advantages to another set of
students ,
as
unconnected
as
themselves .
So also with
regard to holding
estates
or other property , if land be
granted for the purposes of religion
or learning to twenty
individuals
not incorporated , there is no legal way of con-
tinuing the property
to any other
persons for the same
purposes , but by endless
conveyances
from one to the
other , as often as the hands are changed.
But when they
are consolidated
and united into a corporation , they and
their successors
are then considered as one person in law :
as one person they have one will , which is usually collected
from
the sense of the
majority of the individuals
: this
one will may establish
rules and orders for the regulation
of the whole , which make a sort of municipal
law of this
little republic
;
or rules and statutes may be prescribed to
it at its creation , which
are then in the place of natural
laws ; the privileges and immunities , the estates
and pos-
sessions
of the
corporation , when
once
vested
in them ,
will be for ever vested
without
any new conveyance (a) ;
for all the individual members that
have existed from the
foundation
to the
present
time , or that shall
hereafter
exist , are but one person in law, a person that never dies ;
in like manner as the river Thames is still the same river ,
though
the parts
which
compose
it are changing
every
instant .

But our laws have considerably
refined
and improved
upon
the
invention , particularly
with regard to sole corporations , consisting of one person
only , of which
the Roman
lawyers
had no notion ;
thus
we read " Neratius
Priscus
tres facere
existimat
col-
legium (d)."
Though they
held ,
that if
a
corporation
originally consisting
of three
persons ,
were
reduced to
one, " si universitas ad unum redit ," it might still subsist
as a corporation
" et stet nomen universitatis " (e).
Before
we proceed to treat of the several incidents of
corporations , as regarded by the laws of England, it will
be convenient
to divide
them into
four
classes , viz. :-
I.
Corporations
existing
at common
law, irrespective
of
statute , and
exclusive
of ;
II. Municipal corporations
;
III. Railway
companies ,
canal
companies ,
gas
com-
panies , and other companies which
require
special par-
liamentary
powers ;
and IV. Joint-stock
companies ,
formed under the Joint - Stock Companies ' Acts (ƒ) .
I.
Under
our first head we propose then
to
treat of
corporations
not falling within
either of the other three
titles
above
mentioned .
We shall find them capable of
various
subdivisions , the respective qualities whereof will
be considered .
One division of corporations is into
aggregate and sole .
A corporation
aggregate consists of many persons united
together
into
one society , and is kept up by a perpetual
succession of members , so
as
to
continue
for
ever ; of
which
kind are the mayor and commonalty of a city , the

person only
and his successors
, who are incorporated by
law, in
order
to give them some legal
capacities
and
advantages , particularly
that of perpetuity , which in their
natural persons they would not have had .
In this sense
the king is
a
sole corporation (g) ;
so is a bishop or an
archdeacon ;
so sometimes is a dean ( ) distinct from his
chapter ;
and so is a rector or vicar .
And the necessity ,
or at least use, of this institution will be very apparent ,
if we consider the case of a parson of a church .
At the
original endowment of parish
churches , the freehold
of
the
church ,
the
churchyard , the
parsonage-house , the
glebe, and the
tithes of the parish
were
vested
in the
then
parson by the bounty
of the donor , as a temporal
recompense to him for his spiritual
care of the inhabitants ,
and with the intention
that
the same emoluments should
ever afterwards
continue
as a recompense for the same
care .
But how was this to be
effected ?
The freehold
was vested in the parson ;
and if we suppose it vested in
his natural
capacity , on
his death it might descend to his
heir , and might be liable to his
debts
and incumbrances
;
or , at best, the heir might be compellable , at some trouble
and
expense , to convey it to the succeeding incumbent .
The law therefore wisely ordained , that the parson , qua-
tenus parson shall never die, any more than the king : by
making
him
and
his
successors
a corporation (i).
By
which
means the original rights
of the
parsonage
are
preserved entire : for the present incumbent , and his pre-
decessor who lived
a century
ago , are in law one and the
same person ;
and what was given to the
one was given.
to the other also ;
though
in order to preserve entire the
original
rights of a parsonage , as against the
acts of the
parson , the legislature
has found it necessary
to restrain

his exercise of the right of alienation
by various
enact-
ments (k).
Another division
of corporations , either sole or aggre-
gate, is into ecclesiastical and lay.
Ecclesiastical
corpora-
tions are those where not only the members that compose
it are entirely spiritual
persons , but where the object of
the institution
is spiritual (7) :
such as bishops ;
certain
deans , all
archdeacons
, parsons , and vicars , who are
sole
corporations ; deans and chapters at present , and formerly
prior and convent , abbot and monks , and the like , bodies
aggregate .
These
are erected
for the furtherance of re-
ligion ,
and perpetuating
the rights of the
church (m).
Lay which
Lay corporations are of two sorts , civil and eleemosynary .
The civil
are such
as
are
erected
for various
temporal
purposes .
The king , for instance , is made a corporation
to prevent in general
the
possibility
of an interregnum,
or vacancy of the throne , and to preserve the possessions
of the crown entire ;
for immediately
upon the demise of
one king , his
successor
is , as we have formerly
seen (n),
in full possession of the regal rights and dignity.
A lay
corporation may be erected
for the good government of a
town or particular district, as a mayor and commonalty ,
bailiff and burgesses
, or the like ;
some lay corporations
have been instituted for the advancement and regulation
of
manufactures
and
commerce ;
as
the
civic
com-
panies (0) of London , and other towns : and some for the

And all these eleemosynary
corporations
are, strictly
speaking ,
lay
and
not
eccle-
siastical ,
even
though
composed
of
ecclesiastical
per-
sons (s) , and although
they may in some things partake
of the nature , privileges , and restrictions of ecclesiastical
bodies.
Having thus mentioned
several species
of corporations
included
within the present
division
of our
subject ,
we
proceed to consider :
1.
How such corporations
may be
created.
2. What
are their powers , capacities , and in-
capacities .
3.
How
corporations
are
visited .
And ,
4.
How they may be dissolved .
1. Corporations , by the civil law, seem to have been
created bythe mere act, and voluntary
association of their
members
provided
such convention was not contrary to
law, for then it was illicitum
collegium (t) .
It does not
appear that the sovereign's
consent was necessary to be
actually given
to the foundation
of them ; it was merely
required that the original founders of these voluntary
and
friendly societies
(for they
were little more than
such)
should
not
establish
any meetings in opposition to the
laws of the state.
But with us in England, the sovereign's consent , either
impliedly or expressly given , is necessary to the erection
of any corporation
such as now treated of (u).
The con-
sent of the crown is implied
in the
case of a corporation
existing
by force of the
common law, to which

kings are supposed to have given their concurrence .
Of
this
sort are the
monarch ,
bishops
(exclusive
of those
recently
constituted
by statute ) , rectors , wardens
of
a
parochial
church , and some others ; who by common law
have ever been held (as far as our books can show us) to
have been corporations virtute officii : and this
incorpora-
tion is so inseparably annexed to their
respective offices ,
that we cannot frame a complete legal idea of any of these
persons , unless we have at the same time
the
idea of
a corporation , capable of transmitting
rights
to its
suc-
cessors .
Another
method
of implication
,
whereby the
crown's consent is presumed , is in the case of a corpora-
tion by prescription ,
such
as the city of London
; and By prescrip-
many
other corporations (x) have existed
as such,
time
whereof the memory of man runneth
not to the contrary ,
and therefore are looked upon in law to be well created .
For though
the
members
thereof
can
show
no
legal
charter of incorporation , yet in
cases
of such high an-
tiquity, the law presumes there once was
one ; and that
by the various
accidents which
length of time
may pro-
duce, the charter has been lost or destroyed
.

So that the imme-

alone , in virtue of the royal prerogative (c).
Corporations

The royal creation may be per-
formed by any words
expressing
incorporation .
Nay , it
has
been held , that if the sovereign grants to a set of
men to have gildam
mercatoriam, a mercantile meeting
or
assembly (d) , this is alone sufficient
to incorporate
and
establish them for ever (e).
The crown (it is said) may grant to a subject the power
of erecting
a corporation (ƒ) , though
the contrary
was
formerly held (g) ; that is, the sovereign may permit
the
subject to name the persons and powers of the corpora-
tion at his pleasure ; but it is really the king who
erects ,
and the subject is but the instrument
: for , though none
but the king can make a corporation , yet he can do it by
deputy (h).

When a corporation
is
erected , a name must be given aname is
to it ; and by that name alone it must sue and be sued , a corpora-
and do all
legal acts ; though
a minute variation
therein
is not material (2).
Such
name is the very being of
its

;
and though
it
is
the will
of
the sovereign
which erects
the corporation
,
yet the name
is
the knot of
its combination
,
without
which
it
could not perform
its
corporate functions
(k).
The name
of

,
says
sir
Edward
Coke
,
is
as
a
proper
name
,
or
name
of
baptism
;
and therefore when
a
private founder
gives his
college
or

a

,
he does
it

as

misdemeanors in its corporate

its members may , in their distinct

Neither

It cannot
be executor or administrator , or
perform
any personal

take an oath

It cannot be seised of
lands to the use of another (c) ; for such kind of confidence
is foreign
to the end of its institution

Neither
can it
be committed
to prison (e) : for its existence being ideal ,
no man can apprehend or arrest it.
And therefore also it
cannot
be outlawed :

that it could

been
settled that an indictment
will, under
various
circum-
stances , lie against it , as for the non -repair of a bridge (h) ,

disobedience to an order of justices (k) ,
the committal

There are , also , other incidents
and powers , which be-
herin
long to some sorts of corporations .
A corporation aggre-
gate may take goods and chattels for the benefit of them-
selves and their successors
, but a corporation sole cannot (x);
for such moveable property is liable to be lost or embezzled ,
and would raise a multitude
of disputes
between the suc-
cessor
and executor ; which the law is careful to avoid .
In ecclesiastical
and eleemosynary foundations , the crown
or the founder
may give them rules , laws , statutes , and
ordinances , which
they are bound to observe
: lay
corpo-
rations , however, constituted for civil purposes , are subject
to no particular
statutes ; but to the common law, and to
their own by-laws , not being
contrary to the laws of the
realm (y) .
Corporations
aggregate , also , which
have by
their
constitution
a head, as
a dean , warden , master , or
the like , cannot
do any
act
during
the vacancy of the
headship ,
except appointing
another :
neither
are they
then
capable of receiving
a grant ; for such corporation
is incomplete without a head ( ≈) .
But there may be a
corporation aggregate constituted
without
a head (a) ; the
component
members whereof have no president
or supe-
rior , but
are all of equal
authority .
In
a
corporation
aggregate , also, the act of the major part is esteemed
the
act of the whole (6) .
By the
civil law this major
part
must
have consisted of two -thirds of the whole ; else no
act could be performed (c) ;
which
perhaps may be one
reason why by it were required
three at least to make a
corporation .
But , with
us, any majority
is sufficient
to
determine
the
act of the whole
body corporate .

Duties of

3. How cor-
porations
may be
visited.
whereas
some
founders
of
corporations
had
anciently
made regulations
in
derogation
in this
respect of the
common
law,
and
rendering
necessary the
unanimous
assent of the society
to any corporate
act (which
king
Henry VIII . found to be a great
obstruction
to his pro-
jected
scheme of obtaining
a surrender of the lands of
ecclesiastical
corporations , ) it was
therefore enacted by
statute 33 Hen . 8 , c. 27 , that all private
statutes should
be utterly void , whereby
any grant or election , made by
the head, with the
concurrence of the major part of the
body , was liable to be obstructed by any one or more ,
being in the minority ; but this
statute extended not to
any negative
or necessary voice given by the founder to
the head of any such society (d).
The general duties of bodies politic , considered in their
corporate capacity , may , like those of natural persons ,
be
reduced to this single one ; that of acting up to the end or
design , whatever it be,
for which
they were created by
their founder (e).
3.
We proceed therefore to inquire , how these corpo-
rations may be visited .
For corporations , being composed
of individuals
subject
to human
frailties ,
are liable
to
deviate from
their
duties .
And for that reason the law
has provided
proper
persons
to visit, inquire
into,
and
correct irregularities
that
may arise in any corporation ,
(d) See Re
Queen's
Coll.
Cam-
bridge , 5 Russ . 64.
(e) It
may be
here incidentally
mentioned
that in the
administra-
tion of property
left upon trust for
charitable
purposes ,
whether
to a
corporation
or to trustees , the rule
that the
donor's
intention
shall
guide the trustees in their adminis
tration
of the trust funds , becomes
much modified
by the
cy-près doc-
trine, which by a long series of de-
cisions
has
now
become
fully
established
in
courts
of
equity .
Under this doctrine
the
Court
of
Chancery will , on failure
of the ex-
press object of the donor's charitable
intentions
,
direct
a
reference
to
inquire what
objects
are (cy-près)
nearest
to
such
express
objects ,
and will direct the
application
of
the trust
funds
to
such
objects .
As to the principles
which govern
the courts in the application
of this
doctrine , see Cherry v. Mott , 1 My.

gers' Co.

HOW VISITed .
581
whether
sole
or
aggregate ,
and whether
ecclesiastical ,
civil , or eleemosynary .
With regard to ecclesiastical cor-
porations , the
ordinary is their visitor ,
so constituted
by
the canon law, and from thence derived to us.
The pope
formerly , and now the sovereign , as supreme ordinary , is
the visitor of the archbishop or metropolitan
; the metro-
politan has the
charge
and
coercion
of his
suffragan
bishops ;
and the bishops in their
several
dioceses
are in
ecclesiastical
matters
the visitors of deans and chapters ,
of parsons
and vicars ,
and all other
spiritual
corpora-
tions (f).
With respect to lay corporations , the founder ,
his heirs , or assigns , are the visitors , whether the founda-
tion be civil or eleemosynary (g) ; for a lay corporation the
ordinary is not to visit (h).
It has often been
said , that civil corporations
are sub-
ject to no visitation , but merely to the common law of the
land ; and this shall be presently explained .
But first , as
we have just stated
that the founder , his heirs or assigns ,
are the visitors of all lay corporations , let us inquire who
is meant by the founder .
The founder of every corpora-
tion in the strictest
and original sense is the sovereign ,
who only can incorporate
a society
and of a civil corpo-
ration , such as mayor and commonalty , &c. , where there
are no possessions
or endowments given to the body , there
is no other founder but the
sovereign : in eleemosynary
foundations ,
however ,
such
as
colleges
and
hospitals ,
where
there is
an
endowment
of lands ,
the
law dis-
tinguishes , and makes two
species of foundation , which ,
according
to sir E.
Coke ,
are called , the
one fundatio
incipiens , or the incorporation , in which
sense the king is
the general
founder
of all colleges
and hospitals
;
the
other fundatio
perficiens , or the dotation of it , in which
sense the first gift of the revenues is the foundation , and
he who gives them is in law the founder : and it is in this

ETC.
last
sense that we generally
call a man the founder
of a
college
or hospital ( ).
But here the royal
prerogative
has effect ; for if the sovereign and a private man join in
endowing an eleemosynary foundation , the sovereign alone
shall be the founder of it.
And , in general , the monarch
being the sole founder
of all civil corporations and the
endower the perficient
founder of all eleemosynary ones ,
the right of visitation
of the former results , according
to
the rule laid down , to the crown ; and of the latter to the
patron or endower.
The sovereign being thus constituted
by the law visitor
of all civil corporations , the law has also appointed
the
place wherein this jurisdiction
shall be exercised
, viz . the
court of queen's bench : where , and where only , all mis-
behaviours of this kind of corporations
are inquired
into
and
redressed,
and
all their
controversies
decided (k) .
And this is what was meant by those who said that these
civil corporations were liable to no visitation
; that is , that
the law having
by immemorial
usage appointed
them to
be visited
and
inspected by their
royal
founder , in
the
court of queen's bench, according to the rules of the com-
mon law, they ought
not to be visited
elsewhere,
or by
any other authority ( ).
And this is so strictly true , that
though
the king by his letters patent had subjected the
(i) 10 Rep . 33.
(k) This only applies to strict visi-
tatorial
superintendence
over the
misbehaviour
of the members
of a
civil corporation in their pure corpo-
rate capacity ; for where a corporation
is guilty of
maladministration
of
trust property , the proper
place for
its remedy is the court of chancery .
Of acivil corporation
the sovereignis
visitor through
the court of queen's
bench ; for corporate bodies , which
respect the regulation
of trade , the
public
police , and the
administra-
tion
of
justice,
are
necessarily
better
regulated
under
the
su-
perintendence
of
a court
of law ;
but,
as regards
eleemosynary
cor-
porations , the visitatorial power of
the
crown
has
been committed
to
the lord
chancellor , as in
matters
of charity
the
more
appropriate
supervisor .

college of physicians to the visitation
of four very learned
persons, the lord chancellor , the two chief justices , and the
chief baron ; though the college had accepted
this charter
with all possible
marks
of acquiescence, and had acted
under it for nearly a century ; yet in the year
1753 , the
authority of this provision , being in dispute , on an appeal
preferred to these
supposed
visitors ,
they
directed
the
legality of their own appointment
to be argued : and , as
this
college
was
merely
a civil,
not
an
eleemosynary
foundation , they at length determined , after several days'
solemn debate , that they had no jurisdiction
as visitors ;
and remitted
the appellant
(if aggrieved) to his regular
remedy in the court of king's
bench ,
since which
time.
persons
having
ground of complaint
against
the
college
have appealed to that court as of course (m) .
Of an eleemosynary corporation , the founder
and his
heirs
are , by the
dotation , of common right the legal
visitors , to see that such property as might otherwise have
descended
to the visitor himself is rightly employed ; but
if the founder has appointed and assigned any other person
to be visitor , then his
assignee so appointed
is invested
with all the founder's
power
in
exclusion of his heir.
Eleemosynary
corporations
are
chiefly hospitals , or col-
leges in the old universities .
These were all
of them
considered by the Roman catholic clergy as of mere eccle-
siastical jurisdiction : however, the law of the land judged
otherwise ; and with regard
to hospitals it has long been
held ( n) , that if the hospital
be spiritual , the bishop shall
visit ; but if lay,
the patron .
This
right of lay patrons
was indeed abridged by stat . 2 Hen . 5 , stat.

But
not
in the light of

as its

are

to
be
reversed
by writ
of
error , it may
be thought to want
one of the essential marks of visita
torial power .

to

commissioners

were of royal

But the subject's right was in part restored
by statute
14 Eliz . c . 5 ,

directed the bishop
to visit those hospitals only , where no visitor is appointed

as shall be nominated

founders .
Yet still , if the founder
appoints nobody ,
the
bishop of the diocese
must visit (0).
Colleges in the universities
(whatever the common law
might formerly have judged ) were certainly
considered by
the
popish
clergy , under
whose direction
they
were, as
ecclesiastical ,
or at least
as clerical ,
corporations ;
and
therefore
the right
of
visitation
was
claimed
by the
ordinary
of the
diocese .
Where
indeed
the
founder
of
a college
wished
to
subject
it
to
a visitor
of
his
own
nomination ,
he
obtained
for
that
purpose
a
papal bull
to
exempt it from the
jurisdiction
of the
ordinary (p).
But whatever might have formerly
been the opinion of
the clergy upon
this subject , it has been established that
colleges are lay corporations , though
sometimes
totally
composed of ecclesiastical
persons ; and that the right of
visitation
does not arise from any principles
of the canon
law, but of necessity was created
by the common law (9) .
The power and jurisdiction
of visitors of colleges and the
doctrine
relating
thereto were considered by lord Holt in
a
case
below
cited (r).
There
the main
question
was ,

(p) Of some of the colleges
at
Oxford , where no
special visitor is
appointed , the bishop
of Lincoln
(the
diocese in which Oxford
was
formerly
comprised ),
has
imme-
morially
exercised visitatorial
autho-
rity
which can only
be
ascribed
to his
supposed title as ordinary
to
visit this , among
other
ecclesias-
tical
foundations .

leges at Cambridge , the

bably for a like reason , the visitor .

POWER
OF THE
VISITOR .

whether
the
sentence
of the bishop of Exeter , who (as
visitor) had
deprived
doctor
Bury the rector of Exeter
college , could be examined
and redressed by the court of
king's bench .
And the three puisne judges of that court
were of opinion , that it might be so reviewed, for that the
visitor's jurisdiction could
not exclude the common law ;
and judgment
was given accordingly .
But the lord chief
justice Holt was of a contrary opinion ; and held , that by
the common law the office of visitor
is to judge accord-
ing to the statutes of the college , and to expel and deprive
upon just occasions , and to hear all appeals of course
: and
that from him , and him only , the party aggrieved ought
to have redress ; the founder
having
reposed in him so
entire
a confidence , that he will
administer
justice
im-
partially , that his determinations
are final , and examinable
in no other court whatsoever .
And , upon this , a writ of
error being brought , the judgment
of the court of king's
bench was reversed
by the house of lords .
This
leading
case has been followed
in subsequent decisions (s).
But ,
where the visitor
is
under
a temporary disability
, there
the court of queen's bench will interpose , to prevent
a
defect of justice (t) .
Also it is said (u) , that if the founder
of an
eleemosynary
foundation
appoints
a visitor ,
and
limits
his jurisdiction by rules
and
statutes , should the
visitor in his
sentence
exceed
those rules , an action lies
against him ; though
not so where he mistakes in regard
to a thing within his power .
(s) In The King v.
The
Master
and Fellows of St. Katherine's
Hall,
Cambridge , 4 T. R. 233, it was de-
cided that , if no special visitor of a
private
eleemosynary
lay founda-
tion
has
been
appointed
by the
founder , the right of visitation
in
default of his heirs devolves to the
crown ,
and
that
the
court
of
queen's
bench
will
not
entertain
visitatorial jurisdiction
over such
foundation
or interfere
by manda-
mus in their
elections ,
but
such
visitatorial
jurisdiction
must
be
exercised
by the
lord
chancellor
alone .

CORPORATIONS , ETC.
4. How a
corporation
4. We will now, in the last place , consider how a cor-
is dissolved. poration may be dissolved .
Any particular
member of it
may be disfranchised , or lose his place in the corporation ,
by acting
contrary
to the laws of the society, or the law
of the land (x) ; or he may resign
by his own voluntary
act.
But the body politic may also itself be dissolved in
several ways ; which
dissolution
is the civil death of the
corporation
and in this
case
their lands and tenements
will revert
to the person
or his
heirs , who granted them
to the corporation ; for the law annexes a condition
to
every such grant , that , if the corporation
be dissolved ,
the grantor
shall have the lands again , because
the cause
of the grant has
failed (y).
The grant is indeed only
during
the life
of the
corporation
;
which may
endure
for ever ; but when that life is determined by the disso-
lution of the body politic , the grantor
takes it back by
reversion , as in the
case
of every other
grant
for life .
The debts of a corporation
aggregate , either to or from
it,
are
totally
extinguished by its dissolution ;
so
that
the members thereof
cannot recover , or be charged with
them , in their natural
capacities (z) ;
agreeably
to the
maxim of the civil law (a) , “ si quid universitati
debetur ,
singulis
non debetur ;
nec, quod
debet universitas , singuli
debent ."
A corporation may be dissolved ,
( 1. ) By
act of parlia-
ment , which is boundless in its
operation .
(2. ) By the
natural
death of all its members , in case of an aggregate
corporation .
(3. ) By the total loss of one or more of its
integral
parts without the power of renewal
(b).

surrender of its

case
the

the regular

an information
in
nature of a writ of quo warranto , to inquire by what war-
rant the members of the defunct body continued to exercise
their corporate power ; having
forfeited
it by such
and
such

The
adoption of this
procedure
for purposes of state in the reigns of king Charles II. and
king James II. , particularly
by seizing the charter of the
city of London , gave great and just
offence
(d) ; though
perhaps , in strictness of law, the proceedings in most of
them were sufficiently
regular : but the judgment
against
that of London was reversed by act of parliament
(e) after
the
Revolution
; and by the
same statute it is
enacted ,
that the franchises of the city of London
shall never more
be forfeited .

At all
events , in the
charter
then
granted
to that
borough , we find words
used granting to the
mayor , burgesses, &c. , that they should
be
one perpetual
corporate commonalty in deed and name, and should have
perpetual
succession (g), words which seem to have been
wanting in earlier charters granted
not only to Kingston-
upon -Hull but to other boroughs , and a charter
granted
to Kingston two years afterwards
recited that it had been
incorporated ( ) .
Other boroughs were incorporated
temp .
Henry VI. in like manner , and from that time charters
of incorporation
were gradually
granted
to the principal
towns throughout
the kingdom .
All these municipal
corporations were undoubtedly in-
stituted for the advancement and regulation of trade, the
local administration
of justice , and the better government
of their
particular
vicinities .
About the reign of queen
Elizabeth ,
however ,
the
municipal
and
parliamentary
franchises
became in most cases united (i) ; and the great
Case of Corporations (k) having ,
about
the
same
time ,
vested the right of making
by -laws in the " select bodies "
of corporations , we find these institutions
completely per-
verted from their original
intention .
In short , from this
period the right of making by-laws , no less than
another
necessary
corporate right , viz . , the right of electing corpo-
rate members , seem to have been much
abused ,
and at
length the " select bodies " did not hesitate to alienate the
corporate property for electioneering purposes () .
These
circumstances , together with the
fact that
the boroughs
throughout
the country were subject to dissimilar
regula-
tions , led to the
passing of the Municipal
Corporation
Act (m) , A.D. 1835 .

This statute ,
as
altered
and amended by subsequent
acts (n) ,
now
regulates
all
municipal
corporations
in
England .
It repeals the provisions of all charters , and
all by-laws , so far , and so far only , as they
are incon-
sistent with the act : it enumerates , in a schedule
, all the
existing
municipal
corporations , and empowers the crown
to incorporate any town in accordance
with the provisions
of the act, on the presentation of a petition
by its inha-
bitants (o).
When incorporated , the management of the borough is
committed to the care of the council ,
a body consisting of
a mayor , aldermen , and councillors , the councillors
being
elected by the burgesses , the aldermen by the councillors
out of their own body , or from
amongst
burgesses quali-
fied to be councillors , and the mayor from and by the
councillors .
Every rated occupier of a house or shop in a
borough who has paid the rates due, and who (not being
an alien ) has resided there (or within seven
miles of it)
for a certain time , and who has not been in the receipt of
relief as a pauper , is entitled to be on the burgess roll (p) .
Further qualifications
are required for the mayor , alder-
men , and councillors .
There are provisions in the act for
the
appointment of various
officers , such as town clerk ,
treasurer , and clerk of the peace , and , in some instances , of
sheriffs and coroners also.

circumstances ,

and also
a salaried
police magistrate .
The general provisions
for appointing
police , and for lighting
and paving
boroughs are usually
vested in the council , and exercised by certain committees
chosen by them out of their own body ; and when an act
of parliament
enacts
that certain things shall be done by
the " local authority " of a place , it usually
declares
that
if there be a municipal
corporation , such local authority
shall be the council .
If unqualified
persons
, or those not duly elected , intrude
themselves into corporate
offices , the remedy is by
quo
warranto .
This
remedy was formerly
only available
to
the crown , and could
only be exercised by the attorney-
general ; but it is now open to any one , by virtue
of the
statute 9 Ann .
c.
20 , which
permits
an information
in
nature of quo warranto
to be brought
with leave of the
court (9) , at the
relation of any person desiring to prose-
cute the same (who is then styled the relator (r) ) , against
any person usurping , intruding into , or unlawfully holding
any franchise
or office in any city , borough , or town cor-
porate ; provides for its speedy
determination ; and directs.
that , if the defendant
be convicted , judgment
of ouster
(as well as a fine ) may be given against him , and that the
relator shall pay or receive
costs
according to the event of
the suit .

establish
a right gained by usurpation
(s) ; but this doc-
trine became gradually
qualified
by rules of court , and
subsequently , by statute 32 Geo . 3 , c . 58 , an information
in the nature of a quo warranto , for the
exercise of any
office or franchise in any city , borough , or town corporate ,
was required to be brought within six years of the defen-
dant's taking the
office upon himself, or of his forfeiture ,
surrender , or avoidance of it.
Also by the 7 Will . 4 and
1 Vict. c. 78 , s . 23 , it is enacted
that .every application
to
the court of queen's bench for the purpose of calling upon
any person to show by what warrant he claims to exercise
the office of mayor , alderman , councillor , or burgess in
any
borough , shall be made
before the
end of twelve
calendar months after the election , or the time when the
person against
whom
such application
may be
directed.
has become
disqualified .
Notwithstanding
the above
enactment , it was doubted
whether
an application
in the nature of a quo warranto
might not still be successfully made against any person
holding
the office of mayor , on the ground
that he was
not duly qualified
to be so elected , by reason of some in-
formality in his previous election to the office of alderman
or councillor , although more than twelve calendar months
might have
elapsed
since such
election
to the office so
alleged to have
been
informal
or defective, and likewise
whether a like application
might not be made against any
other corporate officer on similar grounds .
This doubt led
to the passing of the stat . 6 & 7 Vict . c. 89 , which
enacted
that
no election of a mayor in any borough
should
be
liable to be questioned by reason of a defect in the title
of
such person to the
office of alderman
or councillor ,
to which
he might have been previously
elected , unless
application
should have been made to the court of queen's
bench , calling
upon such person to show cause by what
warrant he claimed to exercise such office of alderman or

councillor , within twelve calendar months after his election
to the said office ; and that every election to any corporate
office within a borough which is not called in question by
application
to the court of queen's bench , shall be deemed
valid to all intents and purposes .
Though
an application
such as
mentioned
cannot now be made after the twelve-
month
specified,
the court
is
not
bound to grant it if
made within that time , but will in their discretion
refuse
it, if they think there has been undue delay (t).
On an
information
for exercising the office of mayor , it was held
no objection to the title that the party who was councillor
when
elected
mayor , was not shown to have been on the
burgess roll at that time , it being
admitted
that he was
defacto
councillor
when
elected
mayor , and that he was
on the burgess roll when elected
councillor
( u) .
To justify
a
quo
warranto
being
issued , the
person
against whom it is applied for must
have actually exer-
cised the office , his title to which is called in question (x).
And it is not sufficient that he has merely been
elected
(y) ,
but the fact of his
having
been sworn in,
though
in-
formally , has been held to be a sufficient user (z).
The
provisions of the statute of Anne
are
confined to
proceedings
taken
against
an individual for usurping
an
office by the party aggrieved .
An information
against a
body of persons for claiming
to be a corporation
can only
be taken by the attorney -general (a).
Indeed the court
have held that they will not even grant an information
at
the suit of a private person
against an individual , when
the object is to try the legality of the charter , and when
it is clear that the information if successful must dissolve

These

as
the

this
prerogative writ issues
from the
court of queen's bench , upon
good
cause
shown to the
court, commanding
the
complainant
to be admitted
or
restored
to his
office .
And the statute requires , that
a
return be immediately made to the first writ of mandamus ;
which return may be pleaded to , traversed , or demurred
to (f) by the prosecutor ,
and his antagonist may reply ,
take issue, or demur , and like proceedings may be had, as
if an action on the case had been brought , for making
a
false return (g) .
After judgment
obtained for the pro-
secutor , he may have a peremptory writ (h) of mandamus
to compel
his admission or restitution .

RAILWAY
COMPANIES ,
ETC.

desired to execute works such as specified , a company was
formed and incorporated for the purpose by act of parlia-
ment, which
act strictly defined the powers it conferred ,
beyond
which
the
company
so
formed
was
unable to
proceed.
When
railways
began
everywhere
to
intersect
the
kingdom , and
other public
companies were set a-going ,
special acts for constituting
them became very numerous ,
and
as of course there were many provisions common to
all
such
acts , it was deemed
expedient
to
pass
certain
general
enactments , to wit , the Companies Clauses
Con-
solidation Act ,
1845 ( 7) , the Lands Clauses Consolidation
Act ,
1845 (m) ,
and the
Railways
Clauses
Consolidation
Act , 1845
(n ) , in reference
to all associations which might
come within their purview .
These acts , amended by subsequent statutes (o) , contain
many useful
provisions which
are applicable
to undertak-
ings of this class, and apply to the companies in question ,
except in so far as they may be altered or affected
by their
special acts of incorporation .
These acts regulate the respective rights of shareholders
and directors of the companies , provide for the making of
mortgages and the borrowing
of money, and settle what
notice is to be given to persons whose land may be taken ,
and how the amount of compensation
due to such persons
is to be assessed .
There is one important particular
in which corporations
such as now treated of differ from those previously
men-
tioned ; the property of the company is divided into shares,
of which
each member holds
one
or more , and which
he
may transfer to any other person , who on the completion
of the transfer becomes
ipso facto a member of the cor-
poration .
These shares
are , however , in very many com-

panies converted into

is divided

the shareholders according to their respective interests (q),
it may be transferred in the
same manner
as
shares (r) ,
and the stockholders , have the same privileges and advan-
tages as shareholders , but , except as regards participation
in dividends and profits , these privileges
are not conferred
by any aliquot part of such amount of consolidated stock
as would
not if existing
in shares
have
conferred the
same (s).
IV. Joint
Stock
Companies
for trading
purposes
are
of comparatively
recent origin.
With the increase of
trade
in modern
times , it
became
usual
to form
com-
panies embracing
a great number
of individuals
for the
purpose of raising
the
requisite
amount
of
capital
for
carrying
on large
operations .
It is obvious
that
consi-
derable
inconveniences
must
attend ordinary
copartner-
ships consisting of very many partners , ex . gr. , in a legal
proceeding it might
be necessary to make every partner
a party
thereto , this would
be difficult to
accomplish
when the company
was plaintiff, and almost impossible
when it was defendant
in a suit ; also in the
course of
time , as the different
partners
died , the difficulty of set-
tling
accounts with their executors
and administrators
would
be well
nigh insuperable .
For
these and
other
reasons it had long been thought desirable to incorporate
companies
such as treated of for certain
purposes ; this
was at one time effected by charter , or special act of par-
liament
and afterwards , in the year 1837 (t) , the crown
was empowered to incorporate such companies by means of
letters patent .
Then , as the number of these undertakings
increased ,
various
statutes
were
passed which
allowed
persons to incorporate
themselves , or rather which incor-

porated them on their
complying with certain formalities
prescribed in the acts themselves .
The statutes now regu-
lating such companies
are the
Companies
Act , 1862
(25
& 26 Vict. c. 89) , and the Companies Act , 1867
(30 & 31
Vict. c.
131 ) , by the former of which
statutes it is
pro-
vided that any number of persons not less than seven (u)
associated for any lawful
purpose
may
by subscribing
their names to a memorandum
of association , and other-
wise complying with the requisitions
of the act in respect
of registration , form
an incorporated
company with or
without
limited liability .
All necessary
formalities
being
complied with , the company becomes
a corporation , and
is
capable
of suing
and
being
sued in
its
corporate
name, and of having
a
common
seal
and
perpetual
succession .
A company
thus
constituted
differs
from
other corpo-.
rations
in many important
respects, inter alia, the pro-
perty of the company
is , like that of railway
companies ,
divided
into
shares, which
may be transferred
from
one
member
to
any
other
person ,
who
thereby
becomes
a
member of the company , and this may (usually )
be done
without the
consent of its
other members .
Each
and
every
member
of the
company is liable
for
its
debts ,
unless the
company be " limited," in which case
he is
liable only to the amount of capital (if any) not called up
on the shares which he holds in it (x).
There are statu-
tory
provisions
for
the
dissolution
of the company by
winding it up , either voluntarily
or compulsorily
, in the
court of chancery when it fails to meet its obligations , or
has lost a certain portion of its property .
(u) After August
7, 1862, no or-
dinary
partnership
for
the
purpose
of carrying
on
trade
can lawfully
consist
of more
than
twenty
per-
sons, or of more than
ten
persons
if established
for
the
purpose

rative .

CORPORATIONS ,
ETC.
A consideration , how brief soever , of these associations ,
naturally suggests
some
reference to the law of partner-
ship in general .
To constitute
a partnership
in respect of
strangers
as well as inter
sese, it has usually
been said ,
that a participation in the profits and loss of the concern (y)
is necessary, and it is clear that
wherever
persons
are
engaged in any trade , business , or adventure on the terms
of sharing in any proportion
the profits and losses there-
from , they
are
at common law partners (~) .
The
true
test of partnership , however , is the fact of agency, or a
participation
in
profits ,
evidencing
that
each
partner
worked
for the benefit of the others , and was therefore
agent for the firm (a ) .
The liability of one partner
for
the
acts
of his copartner is in truth the liability of a
principal for the acts of his agent .
Where two or more
persons are engaged
as
partners
in an
ordinary
trade,
each of them
has an implied
authority
from the others
to bind all
by contracts
entered
into according
to the
usual course of business in that trade.
Every partner
in
trade is , for the ordinary purposes of the trade , the agent
of his copartners , and each is therefore liable for the ordi-
nary trade contracts of the others . " Partners , indeed ,
may stipulate
among themselves that
some one of them
only shall enter into particular
contracts , or into any con-
tracts , or that as to certain of their
contracts none shall
be liable
except those by whom they are actually made ;
but with such private arrangements third persons , dealing
with the firm without notice , have no concern.
The public
have a right to assume that every partner has authority from
his copartners to bind the whole firm in contracts made
according to the ordinary
usages of trade .
This principle
applies not only to persons acting openly and avowedly as
partners , but to others who , though not so acting , are by

secret
or
private
agreement ,
partners
with
those
who
appear ostensibly to the world as the persons
carrying
on
the business "(b).
To exhibit in other words the reasoning above
set forth,
"a man who allows another to carry on trade , whether in
his own name or not , to buy and sell , and to pay over all
the
profits to him, is undoubtedly
the principal , and the
person
so
employed
is the agent ,
and the
principal
is
liable for the
agent's contracts in the
course of his em-
ployment .
So if two
agree
that they should
carry on a
trade , and share the profits of it , each is a principal , and
each
is an agent for the other , and each is bound by the
other's
contract
in
carrying on the trade , as much
as a
single
principal would
be by the
act of an agent , who
was to give
the
whole
of the
profits
to his
employer .
Hence
it becomes
a test of the liability of one
for
the
contract
of another , that he is to receive
the whole or a
part of the profits
arising from that contract by virtue of
the agreement made at the time of the employment " (c) .
Such is the true
principle
of partnership
liability ,
and
perhaps the maxim , that he who partakes
the advantage
ought
to
bear the loss (d) ,
often
stated in the
earlier
cases
on this subject , is
only
the
consequence
, not the
cause why a man is made liable as partner (e) .
The doctrine of implied agency must be applied only in
regard to contracts made in the usual course
of trade, and
a question
sometimes arises whether
a particular
contract
was made in the ordinary
course of trade , so
as to give
one copartner
an authority
to bind the firm.
Thus , al-
though it is clear that merchants
and partners in trade
can bind
each
other by accepting bills of exchange , this
being
an
act necessarily
done in the regular
course of

business , it has
been
held
that
attornies
quà
attornies
have no such power (ƒ ) , nor , it would appear, have far-
mers (g) .
So
a horse dealer
would
have the power to
bind
his
partner
by the
warranty
of a horse,
though
given
contrary
to a private
agreement
between
them-
selves (h),
though
persons in
another
business
could
not .
In applying
the doctrine
that community of profit and
loss constitutes
or
evidences a partnership
as
regards
third
persons , difficulty often
arose
at common
law
in
determining
what participation
in the profits might thus
suffice ( ) ,
and
cases
occurred of
extreme hardship ,
as
where a servant was held to be a partner , and liable for
the debts of the firm , merely because
a per centage of the
profits had been paid to him in part of wages.
All diffi-
culty of this kind has however been obviated by the statute
28 & 29 Vict . c. 86 , which enacts that no person shall
be
constituted
a partner by advancing
to a trader a sum of
money as a loan , with the understanding
that he
shall
receive
a share of the profits by way of interest or other-
wise (k) ; also, that no servant or agent shall be accounted
a partner , because
his remuneration
consists of a specified
share of the profits (7) .
There are , further , provisions in
this enactment
that a man who sells the goodwill
of his
business
and
reserves
a share of the future
profits
as a
consideration for the sale
(m) , and that the widow or child
of a deceased trader , receiving by way of annuity a portion
of the
profits of the business (n) , shall not be subject to
the liabilities
of the trader carrying on the same.

THE CURRICULUM OF LEGAL EDUCATION AT THE
INNS OF COURT .
THE entire system of education at the Inns of Court may be said
to include
the following
subjects-I. The admission of students ;
II. The
mode of keeping terms ; III . The calling
of students to
the bar ; IV. The granting of certificates to practise under the bar ;
and V. The lectures and examinations .
The system is based
upon
certain regulations
approved of by the Four
Societies jointly , of
which the substance is as under :--
I. As to the Admission of Students .-Every person (a), not otherwise
disqualified , who has passed
a public
examination
at any of the
universities
within the British dominions , may be admitted as a
student at any Inn of Court , for the purpose of being called to the
bar , or of practising under the bar , without passing any preliminary
examination . But every other person so applying to be admitted is
required before admission to pass an examination (b) in the following
subjects,
viz .
( a)
The
English
Language
;
( b)
The
Latin
language ;
and
(e) English History.
The
Benchers of any Inn
:
(a) No
attorney at law, solicitor ,
writer
to the signet,
or
writer
of the
Scotch courts, proctor, notary public , clerk in chancery, parliamentary
agent,
or agent in any court original or appellate, clerk to any justice of the
peace,
or person acting in any of these capacities, and no clerk of or to any barrister ,
conveyancer, special pleader, equity draftsman , attorney, solicitor , writer to the
signet, or writer
of the
Scotch courts, proctor, notary public ,
parliamentary
agent, or agent in any court original or appellate, clerk in Chancery , clerk of
the peace, clerk
to any justice of the peace, or of or to any officer in any court
of law or equity, or person acting in the capacity of any such clerk, is admis-
sible as a student at any Inn of Court for the purpose of being called to the bar ,
or of practising
under the bar, until such person shall have entirely and bond
fide ceased to act or practise in any of the capacities above-named or described ;
and if on the
rolls
of any court,
shall
have taken
his
name off the
rolls
thereof.

have power however to relax
or dispense with this regulation , in
whole or in part , in any case in which they may think that
special
circumstances justify a departure from it.
II. As to keeping
terms .-Students of the Inns of Court , being
at
the same time
members of
any
of the
universities
of Oxford ,
Cambridge , Dublin , London , Durham , the Queen's University in
Ireland , St. Andrew's , Aberdeen , Glasgow , or Edinburgh, can keep
terms by dining in the halls of their
respective societies
any three
days in each term ; and students , who are not at the same time
members of any of the said universities , may do so by dining in the
halls of their respective societies any six days in each term (c).
III. As to calling to the Bar.-Every student must have attained
the
age of twenty -one
years before being
called to the bar , and
must
have kept twelve
terms
before being so called , unless any
term
or terms
shall
have
been
dispensed with
as hereinafter
mentioned (d). Further , no student is eligible to be called to the bar
who has not attended during one whole year the lectures and private
classes
of two of the readers , unless he has been a pupil during
one whole year , or periods equal to one whole year , in the chambers
of some barrister , certified special pleader , conveyancer , or drafts-
man in equity , or two or more of
such persons , or
has
satis-
factorily
passed
a general examination (e).
Calls to the Bar take place during term and on the same day by
the several
societies , namely , on the sixteenth day of each
term ,
unless such day happen to
be
Sunday , and in such
case on the
Monday after .
IV. As to certificates
to practise
under
the Bar.-No student of any
Inn of Court
is allowed to apply for or take out any certificate to
practise , either
directly or indirectly , as
a special pleader , or con-
(c) But
no day's attendance in hall will be available
for the
purpose of
keeping term , unless the student attending shall have been present at the grace
before dinner , during the whole of dinner , and until the concluding grace shall
have been said.
(d) A rule has also very recently been promulgated to this effect :-That not
more than four terms under any circumstances be dispensed with in favour of
students
coming
from
India
or the colonies with a view to return to residence
there, and that it is not expedient to dispense with any terms for such students
except on the following conditions , viz . (1.) That students from India do satis-
factorily
pass an examination in Hindu
and Mahommedan
law , the
Indian
penal code, the codeof civil procedure, the Intestate and Testamentary Act, and
in such other codes or acts as may from time to time becomelaw in British
India ;
and in addition to such examination
do pass such examinations and abide by
all such rules and regulations as are now in force for
students seeking a pass
certificate
by examination for
call
to the
bar.
(2.) That
students from the
colonies do pass such an examination as is required , and do abide by all such
rules
and regulations as are now in
force in order to obtain
a certificate of
honour .
(3.) Provided that each Inn of Court may under very special circum-
stances dispense with the above conditions .
(e) Students
admitted
before the
first
day of Hilary Term ,
1864, have
the
option of qualifying
themselves to be called to the bar, either under the
previous
rules
of
the
Inns of
Court
of Hilary Term ,
1852, or under the
present regulations .

veyancer , or draftsman in equity , without the special permission of
the benchers of the society of which
he is a student , and no such
permission will
be granted until the
student
applying
has kept
twelve terms .
Such permission is granted for one year only from
the date thereof , but may be renewed
annually .
No student
can obtain any such certificate unless he shall have
attended
such lectures and classes , or passed
such an examination ,
or been such pupil,
as would
be necessary to entitle him to be
called to the Bar (ƒ).
V.
As to the Lectures
and Examinations .-These are
under the
special superintendence of " The
Council
of
Legal
Education ,"
consisting of eight Benchers , of whom two are nominated by each
of the Inns of Court , and of whom four are a quorum .
The Council
has power to grant
dispensations to students , who
may have been prevented by any reasonable cause from complying
with
the regulations
as
to attendance at
lectures and
classes ,
and all arrangements touching the number of public lectures to be
delivered by the readers, and the hours
and
extent
of
private
classes , are with the Council .
For the purposes of education the legal
year is
considered
as
divided into three terms , one commencing on the
1st of November
and ending on the 22nd of December , the second
commencing on
the 11th of January and ending on the 30th of March , and the
third commencing
on the 15th of April and ending on the 31st of
July, subject to
a deduction
of the days intervening
between the
end of Easter and the beginning of Trinity Term .
For the purpose of affording to the students , the means of ob-
taining
instruction
and guidance in their legal studies, six readers
are appointed , viz. :—( 1) a reader on jurisprudence
and civil and
international
law ;
(2) a reader on the law of real property ; (3) a
reader
on the
common law (g) ;
(4 ) a reader on equity ;
(5) a
reader on constitutional law and legal history ; and (6 ) a reader on
Hindu
and Mahommedan law, and on the laws in force in British
India .
The duties of these readers
principally
consist in the delivery of
lectures in each
educational term ( h) ;
of the formation of classes
of students , for the
purpose of
giving
instruction
in
a more
detailed
and personal
form than
can be
supplied
by
general
lectures ;
and of
affording
to
students ,
generally ,
advice
and
directions for the conduct of their professional studies .
The
readers also assist in conducting the general examinations
(f) Students admitted before the
first
day of Hilary Term ,
1864, have
the option of qualifying
themselves to obtain such certificates, either under the
rules
of the Inns of Court
of Hilary Term ,
1852, or under
existing regu-
lations .
(g) It is part of the duty of the reader on the common law to give instruc-
tion in his lectures on the subject of the office and duties of magistrates.
(h) Two courses of lectures are delivered by the reader on common law, the
reader on equity, and the reader on real property , in each educational term , of
which one is on the elementary, and the other on the more advanced portion of
the subject to which his lectures apply .

held twice a year (i) , for the examination
of all such
students as
may be desirous of being examined
previously
to being called to
the bar .
As an inducement
to students
to propose themselves for such
examination , studentships
and
exhibitions
have
been
founded
of fifty guineas
per
annum
each , and twenty - five
guineas
per
annum
each
respectively , to continue for a period of three years .
One such studentship is conferred on the most distinguished student
at each general examination , and one
such exhibition is conferred
on the student who obtains the
second
position ; and further
the
examiners select and certify the names of three other students who
have passed
the next best examinations , and the Inns of Court to
which such students as aforesaid belong , may , if desired , dispense
with any Terms , not exceeding two , that may remain to be kept by
such students previously to their being called to the bar .
Pass
certificates for a call to the bar are also awarded at these examina-
tions ; the examiners , however , are not obliged to confer or grant
any
studentship ,
exhibition ,
or
certificate ,
unless
they
are of
opinion
that
the examination
of the
students has been
such as
entitles them thereto .
At
every
call to
the bar
those
students who have
passed
a
general
examination , and either obtained
at such examination
a
studentship , an exhibition , or a certificate of honour , take rank in
seniority
over all other students who may be called on the same
day .
The examination
is by printed
and oral questions on books and
subjects specified
in a programme previously
issued .
Besides the above
general examinations there are, in the month
of July, in each
year , voluntary
examinations
of the
students
upon the subjects
of the
several
courses
of lectures ,
but
no
student is entitled to go in for examination on any of such subjects ,
unless he has obtained
a certificate from the reader that he has
duly attended
his lectures and classes upon the subject on which he
offers
himself for examination (k).
These voluntary
examinations
are conducted
by
barristers
(not being
readers) nominated for
that purpose by the Council of Legal Education .
As an inducement
to students to attend and make themselves
proficient in the subjects of the lectures , exhibitions of the respec-
tive
values below
mentioned (7), have
been founded and are con-
(i) These examinations are held in or shortly before Michaelmas Term , and
in or shortly before Trinity Term .
(k) It is ordered that no student
who shall be entitled
to a certificate of
having attended the advanced course of lectures of the reader on common law ,
on equity , or on the law of real property , shall
be at liberty to go in for ex-
amination
upon the subject of the elementary course of lectures on the same
head ;
and that
no student ghall be admitted for examination on the subject
of the elementary course of lectures, on any of the above-mentioned heads, after
he shall
have kept more than
eight terms, or for examination on any of the
subjects,
after
he shall
have kept
all
his
terms, unless in
either case the
Council of Legal Education for special reasons think
fit
to
allow the same

THE EXISTING
STATE
OF THE FRANCHISE , ETC (a).
VOTERS at elections , or persons
enjoying the franchise , may with
a few exceptions be divided into two classes , viz . voters in counties
and voters in boroughs ,
whose
qualifications
are different ,
and
principally
depend upon the reform acts of 1832 (b) and 1867 (c).
Voters for counties comprise first the forty -shilling
freeholders ,
that is , those who have a freehold property in fee simple or fee tail
of that value
per annum (d).
Secondly , any person possessing a
freehold estate for life or lives of the annual value of forty shillings ,
but under

If
persons
of
this
class
do
not actually occupy
the premises which
qualify them

they must either have possessed
the

person to a vote by reason of his being
a joint occupier
of any
dwelling house, but as it is expressly enacted (n ) that the franchises
conferred by that act are in addition
to and not in substitution
of
any franchises already existing , this provision
does
not take away
the right of voting conferred by stat. 2 Will . 4 , c. 45 , s. 29 , on all
joint occupiers in a borough when the annual value
of the house
divided by the number of occupiers is not less than 107.
Secondly , the rated occupiers of premises
other than a dwelling-
house of the annual value of 107., and in this
case joint
occupiers
may vote, provided that the value of the
premises divided by the
number of occupiers be not less than 10%. If it be less , none of the
occupiers
have any vote (o) .
Thirdly , the
occupiers of lodgings ,
such
lodgings
being part of the
one and the same dwelling house ,
and of the annual value of 107., if let unfurnished (p).
The above mentioned comprise the principal
persons who are now
entitled
to the franchise ; the privilege is also
possessed
by some
persons
as members of certain universities , who have a right of
voting for candidates to be returned to parliament by such univer-
sities .
And there are a few other persons such as freeholders and
burgage tenants in some cities or towns having certain estates , also
freemen and liverymen in London , and freemen and burgesses by
servitude (7) in a few other places .
We proceed to notice certain
necessary formalities which must
take place before an election can be held .
In the case of a general
election , following
a dissolution of parliament , the procedure is, after
a royal proclamation
to that
effect ; that writs
are sent from the
petty bag office (r) to the sheriff of every county , and the return-
ing officer of every city and borough , for the election of knights ,
citizens and burgesses to serve in parliament .
If a vacancy take
place during
the
session
the
speaker, on motion
made, signs
a
warrant to the clerk
of the crown in chancery , to issue a writ for
the return
of a fresh
member ;
and the
same
course is pursued
during the recess of parliament , as
soon
as the speaker is informed
of the vacancy by the
certificate of two
members (s).
On the
receipt of such writ, the sheriff , or other returning
officer, is to
give public
notice that
an election will
be held within a certain
specified
time (t) .
He is also to provide for the erection of polling
booths and give public notice of the situation of each booth (u).
On the day of election , as
soon
as the writ has been
read , the
sheriff or other returning
officer, must take the bribery oath (x) ,
after which it is usual for the respective candidates to be proposed
and seconded
by electors, and if no more are proposed

returned , they are then
and there duly
elected . If there be more
than the proper number , the sheriff , or returning
officer, calls for a
show of hands , and pronounces
the candidate or candidates duly
elected for whom , in his opinion , the largest
number
of hands is
displayed .
This decision , if not
questioned , is conclusive ;
but a
poll is often called for , and if demanded by any candidate or elector
must be granted .
The poll in most instances must commence
the
day or day but
one
after the nomination , and in most
cases can
only last one day , and between the hours of eight and four (y).
Till
1854 every voter was obliged to take the bribery oath , if so
required (z), but this necessity no longer exists (a ) ;
there are only
two questions which
can now be put to an elector before
he votes,
viz .
1st , whether he be the same person whose name appears on
the register , and 2ndly , whether he have already voted
(b) , and, if
required , he must answer these questions on oath (c).
At the termination
of the poll the poll books are to be closed and
sealed , and delivered
to the
sheriff or returning
officer, who in
counties
is to keep them till the day but one , and in boroughs till
the day following
the poll , when
he is openly to break the seals ,
add up the number of votes, then
openly declare the state of the
poll , and make proclamation
of the
member
or
members duly
elected
(d ) .
In cities and boroughs , however , the returning
officer
may , if he
pleases , declare the
final
state of the poll , and make
the return immediately at the close of the poll ; if he does not do
so then , he must wait till the next day (e).
Formerly, if a candidate was considered
unduly
returned to par-
liament , the remedy was by petition to the House of Commons , on
which the House appointed a committee of its own members to try
the question (f) , but now , by 31 & 32 Vict. c. 125 , the petition is
to be presented to the Court of Common
Pleas , and the case is to
be tried by one of the puisne judges of the
superior courts , with-
out a jury.

SECTION II.
THE
NATURE
OF
LAWS
IN GENERAL .
LAW, in
its
most
general
and
comprehensive
sense
,
signifies
a
rule
of
action
;
and
is
applied indiscriminately
to
all
kinds
of
action
,
whether
animate
or
inanimate
,
rational
or
irrational
(a).
Thus
we
say
,
the
laws
of
motion
,
of gravitation
,
of
optics
,
or
mechanics
,
as
well
as
the laws
of nature
and of nations
.
Law
is
a
rule
of
action which
is
prescribed by some superior
,
and which
the inferior
is
bound
to
obey
.
Thus
,
when the Supreme Being formed
the universe
,
and created matter
out
of
nothing
,
he impressed certain
principles
upon
that
matter
,
from
which
it
can
never
depart
,
and without which
it
would
cease
to
be
.
When
he put
that
matter into motion
,
he established
certain
laws of motion
,
to
which all moveable bodies must con-
form
.
And
,
to
descend from
the greatest
operations
to
the smallest
,
when
a
workman
forms
a
clock
,
or
other
piece
of
mechanism
,
he establishes
,
at
his own pleasure
,
certain arbitrary
laws for its direction
;
as
that
the hand
shall
describe
a
given
space
in
a
given
time
;
to
which
law
as
long
as
the work conforms
,
so
long
it
continues
in
perfection
,
and answers the end of its formation
.
If
we farther
advance
,
from
mere inactive
matter to
vegetable
and
animal
life
,
we
shall
find
them
still
governed by laws
;
more
numerous
indeed
,
but
equally
(a)
The word
"
law
"
may apply
to"
anything
laid down
or
imposed
,
either by God
or
nature
,
by
a
people
binding
themselves
,
or
by
a
prince
governing
a
people
."
Richardson
Dict
.

THE
LAW
OF NATURE .
31
fixed and invariable .
The whole
progress of plants , from
the seed to the root , and from thence to the
seed
again ;
-the method of animal
nutrition
, digestion ,
secretion ,
and all other branches of vital economy ;-are not left to
chance , or the will of the creature itself, but are performed
in a wondrous involuntary
manner , and guided by unerring
rules laid down by the great Creator .
This then is the general
signification
of law, a rule of
action
dictated
by some superior
being ;
and in those
creatures that have neither the power to think nor to will ,
such laws must be invariably
obeyed , so long as the crea-
ture
itself
subsists ,
for
its
existence
depends
on that
obedience.
But laws , in
their
more
confined
sense
(in
which it is our present business to consider them ) , denote
the rules , not of action in general , but of human
action
or
conduct ;
that
is , the
precepts by
which
man , the
noblest of all sublunary beings , a creature endowed with
both reason and free-will , is commanded to make use of
those faculties in the general regulation
of his behaviour .
Man, considered
as
a
creature ,
must
necessarily
be
subject
to the laws of his
Creator ,
for he
is
entirely a
dependent
being .
A being ,
independent of any other ,
has no rule to pursue , but such as he prescribes to him-
self ; but a state of dependence
will inevitably
oblige the
inferior
to take the will of him, on whom
he depends , as
the rule of his
conduct ; not indeed in every particular ,
but in all those points wherein
his
dependence
consists .
This principle
has more or less extent and
effect , in pro-
portion
as the superiority of the
one and the dependence
of the other is greater or less , absolute or limited .
And
as man depends absolutely upon his Maker for everything ,
it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his
Maker's will .
ture.
This will of his Maker

man , and endued him with free-will , he laid down certain
immutable
laws of human
nature , whereby that free -will
is in some degree regulated
and restrained , and gave him
also the faculty of reason to discover the purport of those
laws .
Considering
the
Creator
only
as a being
of infinite
power , he was
able
unquestionably
to
have
prescribed
whatever
laws
he pleased to his creature , man , however
unjust or
severe .
But
as he is also a being of infinite
wisdom , he has laid down only such laws as were founded
in abstract justice.
These
are
the
eternal ,
immutable
laws of good and evil , to which the Creator himself
in all
his dispensations
conforms ; and which he
has
enabled.
human reason to discover , so far as they are necessary for
the conduct of human
actions .
Such among others are
these
principles
: that
we
should
live
honestly ,
should
hurt nobody, and should
render to every one his due ; on
which three general
precepts
Justinian
has grounded the
whole doctrine of law (b) .
But if the discovery of these first principles of the law
of nature
depended
only upon the due exertion of right
reason, and could not otherwise be obtained
than by a
chain of metaphysical disquisitions , mankind
would
have
wanted
some inducement
to have quickened
their inqui-
ries , and the greater part of the world
would
have
rested
content in mental
indolence , and
ignorance , its insepa-
rable
companion .
As therefore
the Creator is
a being ,
not only of infinite
power and wisdom , but also of infinite
goodness , he has been
pleased
so to
contrive the consti-
tution
and frame of humanity , that we should
want no
other prompter
to inquire
after
and pursue the
rule
of
right , but only our own self-love, that universal
principle
of action .

parably
interwoven
the laws of eternal justice
with the
happiness
of
each
individual
,
that the latter
cannot
be
attained but by observing the former : and, if the former
be punctually obeyed , it cannot but induce the latter .
In
consequence of which
mutual
connexion
of justice
and
human
felicity , he has not perplexed
the law of nature
with a multitude
of abstract rules and precepts , referring
merely
to the fitness
or unfitness
of things ; but has
graciously
reduced the
rule
of
obedience
to
this
one
paternal precept- that
man should
pursue his own true
and substantial
happiness .
This is the foundation of what
we
call
ethics ,
or
natural
law ;
the primary
object
of
which is to demonstrate , on the
one
hand , that this
or
that action
tends
to man's real happiness , and therefore
that the performance of it is a part of the law of nature ;
on the other hand , that this
or that
action is destructive
of man's
real happiness , and therefore
that
the law of
nature forbids it.
This law of nature being coeval with mankind , and dic-
tated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation
to any
other .
It is binding
over all the globe , in all
countries , and at all times : no human
laws are of any
validity , if contrary
to this ; and
many of them
derive
their force and principal
authority from this original .
But in order to apply the law of nature to the parti-
cular exigencies of each individual
, it is still necessary
to
have
recourse
to reason : whose office it is to discover , as
was
before
observed
, what the law directs in every cir-
cumstance of life ; by considering what
method will tend
the most
effectually to our
own
substantial
happiness .
And if our reason were always clear and perfect , unruffled
by passions , unclouded
by prejudice , unimpaired
by dis-
ease
or
intemperance ,
the task
would
be pleasant and
easy ; we
should
need
no
other
guide
than
this .
But
every man now finds the contrary in his own experience ;
that his reason is corrupt , and his understanding full of
ignorance and error .

THE NATURE
OF
LAWS
IN GENERAL .
Revealed
law of God.
This has given manifold
occasion
for the benign inter-
position of Divine Providence
; which , in compassion
to
the frailty , the imperfection , and the blindness
of human
reason, has been pleased , at sundry times and
in divers
manners , to discover and enforce its laws
by an imme-
diate and direct revelation .
The doctrines thus delivered
we call the revealed or divine
law, and they
are
to
be
found only in the Holy Scriptures .
These precepts tend ,
as
does
the
original
law of nature , in all their conse-
quences , to man's felicity .
But we are not from thence to
conclude that the
knowledge of these
truths was attain-
able by reason, in its present vitiated state ; since we find
that , until they
were revealed, they
were hid from the
wisdom of ages .
As then the moral
precepts of this law
are indeed of the
same
origin with those of the law of
nature , so their
intrinsic
obligation
is of equal strength
and perpetuity .
Though undoubtedly
the revealed
law is
of infinitely more authenticity
than
that
moral
system
which is framed by ethical writers , and denominated the
natural law.
Because one is the law of nature expressly
declared so to be by God himself ; the other is only what,
by the assistance of human
reason , we imagine to be that
law. If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of
the former , both would have an equal authority
: but , till
then , they can never be put in any competition
together .
Upon these two foundations , the law of nature and the
law of revelation , depend , mediately
or immediately , all
human
laws ; no human
laws should
be suffered to con-
tradict these.
There are, it is true , many matters per se
indifferent , as to which nevertheless legislation
is needed for
the public good , and in foro conscientiæ
obedience
is due to
laws enacted
by the constituted government for the benefit
of society.
With regard to such points
as are not indif-
ferent , human laws must be deemed declaratory of and to
derive
efficacy from the divine
ordinances ;
yet in the
moral guilt of violating a law thus
promulgated , is in-
volved the ingredient
of a disobedience to a defacto social

To instance in the
case of murder : this is
expressly
forbidden
by the divine
and demonstrably
by
the natural law ;
and
from
these
prohibitions
arises
mainly the turpitude of this
crime .
Those human laws
which
annex
a punishment
to it,
do however
superadd
fresh obligation
on
each
member
of the
community
to
abstain from its perpetration . If indeed any human
law
should allow or
enjoin
us to
commit it, we should
be
bound
to transgress that human law,
or
else
we should
offend against
both the natural
law and the divine

But with

matters in

THE

IN GENERAL .
of mankind
to be united in one great society , they must
necessarily
form separate
states ,
commonwealths ,
and
nations , entirely independent of each other , and yet liable
to a mutual
intercourse .
Hence
arises a third kind of
law to regulate this mutual
intercourse , called " the law
of nations " (e) : which ,
as
none of these states will ac-
knowledge
a superiority in the
other , cannot be dictated
by any ; but depends
entirely
upon
the rules
of natural
law , or
upon
international
comity (f) , or upon
mutual
compacts , treaties , leagues , and agreements between these
several communities : in the construction
also of which
compacts , we have no other rule to resort to, but the law
of nature ; being the only one to which all the communi-
ties are equally subject , and therefore in the civil law (9)
we read-quod naturalis ratio inter omnes homines constituit,
vocaturjus gentium (h).
Such and
so broad
as this
being
the
foundation
on
which
international
law reposes , we yet learn from our
reports that it cannot be allowed
to prevail in any case
where it runs counter to elementary principles
of justice ,
to the law of nature , or the law of God .
Thus , in virtue
of international
comity , the judgment
, decree , or sentence
of a foreign
court
is
here
held
conclusive
quoad that
which it professes
to decide, and yet this rule
must
be
limited by provisos that the foreign court has jurisdiction
(e) " The
true
foundation
on
which the
administration
of inter-
national
law must rest , is that the
rules which ought
to
govern
are
those
which
arise
from
mutual
interest
and utility , from a sense of
the
inconveniences
which
would
result from a contrary
doctrine , and
from a sort of moral necessity to do
justice
in order that
justice
may be
done to us in return ."

Having

much
concerning

to treat more fully the principal
subject of this

municipal

is , the rule by which
par-
ticular districts , communities , or nations
are governed ;
defined by Justinian to be (k) quod

with common
speech
; for though , strictly, that expression
denotes the particular
customs

propriety
be
ap-
plied to any one state or nation , which is governed by the

179, an action
of
debt
was
brought
upon
a judgment
of the
Court of Common
Pleas in Ireland .
Plea , that though
the judgment
was
in fact obtained by plaintiff against
defendant , yet " defendant was not
at any time arrested upon or served
with any process issuing
out of the
said
court
for the
cause of action
upon which judgment
was obtained ,
nor had
he
at any time notice
of
such
process , nor did he appear to
the
action ."
The
question
was
whether
this
plea,
assuming
the
facts
alleged in it to
be
proved ,
afforded any answer to the suit ? It
was held
to
do so ; Lord
Denman
observing
that
the
grounds
of a
foreign judgment may be inquired
into where
the
proceedings
which
resulted
in
such
judgment
were
plainly contrary
to natural
justice .
An Irish judgment , he admits , is a
record
for
certain purposes so as to
bar any inquiry into the merits
of
the case or the propriety
of the
de-
cision , though
not
to preclude
in-
quiry whether
the judgment
passed
under such circumstances
as showed
that the court
had
properly juris-
diction
over
the
litigants ;
or
whether
the
defendant
had
had
notice
of the
proceedings , or had
been before the court .
In this case
the defence raised on the particular
issue
availed
the
defendant ,

38
THE
NATURE
OF
LAWS
IN
GENERAL .
Municipal
law is " a
rule"
" of civil
conduct"
power in a state, commanding
what
is right, prohibiting
what is wrong , and regulating
matters in themselves in-
different ."
Let us endeavour to explain its several pro-
perties , as they arise out of this definition .
And , first , it is " a rule ": not a transient
sudden order
from a superior , to or concerning
a particular
person ; but
something permanent , uniform , and universal .
Therefore
a particular
act of the legislature
to confiscate the goods
of Titius , or to attaint him of high treason , does not enter
into the idea of a municipal
law: for the operation of this
act is spent upon Titius
only , and has no relation to the
community in general ; it is rather a sentence than a law.
But an act to declare that the crime of which
Titius is
accused
shall be deemed
high treason ; this has perma-
nency , uniformity, and universality
, and therefore is pro-
perly
a rule .
It is also called a rule , to distinguish
it
from advice or counsel , which we are at liberty to follow
or not , as we see proper , and to judge upon the reason-
ableness or unreasonableness of the thing advised ; whereas
our obedience
to the law depends not upon our approba-
tion , but upon the maker's will .
Counsel is only matter
of persuasion , law is matter of injunction
; counsel acts
only upon the willing , law upon the unwilling also.
It is also called
a " rule," to
distinguish
it from a
compact or agreement , for a compact is a promise
pro-
ceeding from
us , law is a command directed to us.
The
language of a compact is , " I will, or will not , do this ;
that of a law is , " thou
shalt , or shalt
not , do it."
It is
true there is an obligation
which a compact carries with
it,
equal in
point
of
conscience to that of a law ; but
then the origin of the obligation
is different .
In com-
pacts , we
ourselves
determine
and
promise
what
shall
be done, before we
are
obliged to do it ; in laws , we are
obliged to act without
ourselves determining
or promising
anything
at all.
Upon these accounts law is defined to
be " a rule ."
Municipal law is also a rule " of civil conduct ."
This
MUNICIPAL LAW.
39
distinguishes
municipal
law from the natural
or revealed
;
the former of which is the rule of moral conduct , and the
latter not only the rule of moral
conduct , but
also the
rule of faith .
These regard
man as a creature , and point
out his duty
to
God , to himself, and to his neighbour ,
considered in the light of an individual.
But municipal
or civil law regards him also
as
a citizen , and bound to
other
duties
towards
his
neighbour
than
those of mere
nature and religion
: duties , which
he has engaged in by
enjoying
the benefits of the common
union ; and which
amount
to no more , than
that he do contribute , on his
part , to the subsistence and peace of the society.
scribed
It is likewise
a rule " prescribed ."
Because
a bare " pre-
resolution , confined in the breast of the legislator , without
manifesting
itself by some external
sign , can never be
properly
a law.
It is requisite
that this
resolution
be
notified to the people who are to obey it.
But the manner
in which this notification
is to be made, is matter of very
great indifference .
It may be notified by universal tradi-
tion and long practice , as is the customary law of England.
It may be notified , viva
voce , by officers appointed for that
purpose ,
as
is
done
with regard
to proclamations ,
and
such acts of parliament
as are appointed to
be publicly
read in churches
and
other
assemblies (1) . It may be
notified
by printing ,
or the like ; which
is the general
course taken with our acts of parliament .
Yet , whatever
method is made use of, it is incumbent
on the promul-
(7)Thus the Confirmatio Cartarum
(25 Ed . 1) enacted (cap. 3) that the
Great
Charter
of Henry III ., and
the Charter of the
Forest , should
be read
in the
cathedral
churches
throughout
the
realm ,
before the
people , twice in every year .
A few
years
afterwards
(34 Ed. 1) still
more careful provision
was made for
the promulgation
of the statute , de
tallagio non concedendo; by cap. 6
of which it was provided
that "all
archbishops
and
bishops
for
ever
shall
read this
present
charter
in
the cathedral
churches
twice in the
year ; and upon the reading thereof
shall openly
denounce
accursed all
that willingly do, or procure to be
done,
anything
contrary
to
the
tenor , force, and
effect thereof , in
any
point
or
article
whatever ."
Other
similar instances will occur
to the reader of our statute -book .

gators of a law to notify it in the most public and perspi-
cuous manner ; not like Caligula, who
(according to Dio
Cassius ) wrote
his laws in a very small
character , and
hung them up upon high pillars , the more effectually to
ensnare the people.
There is still a more unreasonable
method than this , which is called
making of laws ex post ·
facto ; when , after an action (indifferent
in itself ) is com-
mitted , the legislature
then for the first time
declares
it
to have been a crime , and inflicts a punishment
upon the
person who has committed it.
Here it is impossible
that
the party could
foresee
that
an action , innocent when it
was done , should
be
afterwards
converted
to guilt by a
subsequent law ; he had therefore no cause to abstain from
it ; and all punishment
for not abstaining
must of conse-
quence
be cruel
and
unjust .
Laws
should
therefore
in
general
be made to commence in futuro, and be notified
before their commencement ; which is implied in the term
" prescribed . "
But when this rule is in the usual manner
notified , or prescribed , it is then the subject's business to
be thoroughly acquainted
therewith
; for if ignorance , of
what he might know , were admitted as a legitimate
excuse ,
for a breach of law, the
laws would be of no
effect , but
might be eluded with impunity .
But , farther : municipal
law is
a rule of civil conduct
prescribed " by the supreme power in a state."
For legis-
lature , as was before observed , is the greatest act of supe-
riority that
can be exercised by one being
over another .
Wherefore it is requisite to the very essence of a law, that
it be made by the
supreme power .
Sovereignty
and
a
power to legislate
are indeed thus far convertible terms :
that one of these
cannot subsist without the other.
This may lead us into
a short
inquiry
concerning
the
nature of society and civil government
; and the natural ,
inherent right which belongs to the sovereignty of a state ,
wherever that
sovereignty be lodged , of making
and en-
forcing laws .
The only true and natural foundations of society are the

wants and the fears of individuals
. Not that we can believe,
with some theoretical writers , that there ever was a time
when there was no such thing as society, either natural or
civil ; or when , from
the impulse of reason , and through
a sense of their
wants
and weaknesses, individuals
met
together in a large plain , entered into an original contract ,
and chose the tallest
man present to be their governor .
This
notion , of an
actually existing unconnected
state of
nature , is too wild to be seriously
admitted
; and besides
it is plainly contradictory
to the revealed accounts of the
primitive origin of mankind .
Families formed
the first
natural
society , among themselves ; which ,
every day ex-
tending
its
limits , laid
the
primary ,
though
imperfect
rudiments
of civil or political society ; when , however , a
social
community
grew
too large
to
subsist with
con-
venience in that
pastoral
state , wherein
the patriarchs
appear to have lived , it necessarily , by various migrations ,
subdivided
itself.
Afterwards ,
as agriculture
increased
,
which
employs and can maintain
a much greater number
of hands , migrations
became
less frequent : and various
tribes , which
had previously
separated
, reunited ; some-
times by compulsion
and conquest , sometimes by accident ,
and sometimes
perhaps by compact .
But though society
had not its formal beginning
from any convention of indi-
viduals , actuated by their wants
and their fears ; yet it is
the sense of their weakness and imperfection which
keeps
mankind
together , which demonstrates the necessity of
this union , and which
therefore
is the solid and natural
foundation , as well as the
cement of civil society.
And
this
is what
we mean by the phrase " original contract
of society (m) ; " which , though
perhaps in no instance
has it ever been formally
expressed at the first institution
of a state, yet in nature and reason
must
always
be un-
derstood and implied , in the very act of associating toge-
ther : namely , that the whole should
protect all its parts ,

meaning
of this phrase , post, p. 46.

THE NATURE

IN

Origin and
object of
and that
every part
should
pay obedience to the will of
the whole ; or , in other words , that the community
should
guard the rights of each individual
member , and that (in
return for this protection )
each
individual
should submit
to the laws of the community
; without
which
submission
of all it were impossible that protection could be certainly
extended to any .
For when civil society is
once
formed , government
at
government. the same time
results of course , as necessary to preserve
and to keep that society in order .
Unless
some superior
be constituted , whose
commands
and
decisions
all its
members are bound
to obey , they would
still
remain
as
in a state of nature , without
any judge upon
earth to
define their several rights , and redress their several wrongs .
But , as all the members which
compose this society were
naturally equal , it may be asked , in whose hands are the
reins of government
to be intrusted ?
To this the general
answer is
easy ;
but
the application
of it to particular
cases has occasioned
many of those mischiefs , which
are
apt to proceed
from misguided political zeal.
In general ,
all mankind will agree that government should be reposed
in such persons , in whom
those qualities
are most likely
to be found , the perfection of which
is among the attri-
butes of Him
who is emphatically
styled
the

and of power : wisdom to discern the real interest of the
community
; goodness to endeavour always to pursue that
real interest ; and strength , or power , to carry such know-
ledge and intention
into
action .
These are the natural
foundations
of sovereignty , and these are the requisites
which
ought to be found in every well - constituted frame
of government .
How the
several forms of government
we now
see in
the world at first
actually began , is matter of great un-
certainty , and has occasioned
infinite
disputes .
However

of govern-
The political writers of antiquity will not allow more Three forms
than three regular forms of government :
the first, when ment.
the sovereign power is lodged in an aggregate
assembly ,
consisting
of all the free members of a community , which
is called a democracy ;
the second, when it is lodged in a
council , composed of select members , and then it is styled
an aristocracy ; the last , when it is intrusted in the hands
of
a
single
person ,
and then it takes
the
name of a
monarchy .
All
other
species
of government , they
say ,
are either corruptions of, or reducible
to , these three.
By the sovereign power , as was before observed
, we may
understand to be meant the
power of making
laws ; for
wherever that
power resides , all others must conform to,
and be directed by it , whatever
appearance the
outward
form
and administration
of the government may put on.
For it is at any time in the option of the legislature
to
alter that form and administration
by a new edict or rule ,
and to put the execution of the laws into whatever hands
it pleases
by constituting
one , or a few , or many execu-
tive
magistrates :
and all the
other powers of the state
must
obey the legislative
power in the discharge of their

found than in the
other
frames
of government ;
being
composed, or intended to be composed
, of the most expe-
rienced
citizens
: but there
is
less
honesty
than in
a
republic ,
and
less
strength
than
in
a
monarchy .
A
monarchy
is , indeed , the
most powerful of any ;
for by
the entire
conjunction
of the
legislative
and executive
powers , all the sinews of government
are knit together ,
and united in the hand of the prince ; but then there is
imminent
danger of his employing
that
strength
for im-
provident or oppressive purposes .
Thus
these
three
species
of government
have their
several perfections
and imperfections .
Democracies
are
usually the
best calculated to direct the end of the law ;
aristocracies to invent the means by which
that
end shall
be obtained ;
and monarchies to carry those means into
execution .
And the ancients , as was
observed , had in
general no idea of any other permanent form of govern-
ment than
these
three : for though
Cicero (n) declares
himself of opinion ,
esse

quæ ex tribus generibus
illis , regali , optimo , et populari,
sit
modicè confusa
;
yet Tacitus treats this notion
of
a
mixed
government
,
formed out
of
them all
,
and partaking
of
the
advantages of each
,
as
a
visionary
whim
,
and one which

effected
,
could never be lasting
or

But
,
happily for
us
of
this island
,
the British constitu-
tion has long remained
,
and
I
trust will long continue
,
a
British con- standing exception
to
the truth
of
this observation
.
For
,
as
with
us
the executive power
of
the laws
is
lodged
in
a
single person
,
they
have all the advantages
of
strength
and dispatch
,
that are
to
be found
in
the most
absolute
monarchy
and
as
the
legislature
of
the
kingdom
is
intrusted
to
three distinct powers
,

and
temporal ,
which
is
an
aristocratical
assembly of
persons
selected
for their
piety and learning , their birth,
their wisdom , their valour , or their property ; and thirdly ,
the house of commons , freely chosen by the people from
among
themselves , which
makes it a kind of democracy ;
as this aggregate body, actuated by different springs , and
attentive
to different
interests , composes
the British par-
liament ,
and
has
the
supreme
disposal
of everything
;
there can no inconvenience
be attempted by either of the
three branches which will not be withstood by one of the
other
two ;
each
branch
being
armed with
a negative
power , sufficient
to repel
any innovation
which it shall
think inexpedient or dangerous .
Here
then
is
lodged
the
sovereignty
of the British
constitution
; and lodged as beneficially
as is possible for
society.
For in no other shape could we be so certain of
finding the three great qualities of government
so well
and so happily
united . If the supreme power were lodged
in any one of the three branches
separately , we should be
exposed to the inconveniences of either absolute monarchy ,
aristocracy , or democracy ; and
so want
two of the three
principal
ingredients of good polity ,-virtue , wisdom , and
power.
If it were lodged in any two of the branches ; for
instance , in the king and house of lords , our laws might
be providently
made , and well executed , but they might
not have always the good of the people in view : if lodged
in the king and commons , we should want
that
circum-
spection and mediatory caution , which the wisdom of the
peers
is to afford : if the
supreme rights
of legislature
were lodged in the two
houses
only , and the king had no
negative
upon their
proceedings , they might be tempted
to encroach upon
the
royal
prerogative , or perhaps
to
abolish
the kingly
office ,
and
thereby
weaken
(if not
totally destroy ) the strength of the executive power .

island is so admi-
rably tempered

danger or hurt it, but destroying
the equilibrium
of power
between one branch of the legislature
and the rest.
For
if ever it should happen that the independence of any one
of the three should be lost , or that it should
become
sub-
servient to the
views of either of the
other
two , there
would soon be an end of our constitution .
The legislature
would
be changed from
that which
(upon the supposition
of an original
contract , either actual or implied ) is pre-
sumed to have
been originally
set up by the general
consent and fundamental
act of the society
and such a
change , however
effected , is according
to Mr. Locke (p)
(who perhaps carries his
theory too far ) at once an entire
dissolution of the bands of government
; and the
people
are thereby reduced to a state of anarchy , with liberty to
constitute to themselves a new legislative
power (q) .
:
Having thus cursorily considered the three usual species
of government , and our own singular constitution , selected
and compounded from them all , I proceed to observe , that ,
as the
power of making
laws
constitutes
the
supreme
authority , so wherever the supreme authority
in any state
resides , it is the right of that
authority
to make
laws ;
that is , in the words of our
definition ,
to prescribe

(q) During
the
proceedings
on
the impeachment
of Dr. Sacheverell
(15 St. Tr. 1) we find Mr. Lechmere
thus speaking
to the Lords (Id . 61) :
" The nature of our constitution
is
that of a limited
monarchy , wherein
the supreme power is communicated
and divided
between Queen, Lords ,
and Commons , though the executive
power and administration
be wholly
in the Crown .
The
terms
of such
a constitution
do not only suppose ,
but express ,
an
original
contract
between the Crown
and the people ,
by which that
supreme power was
(by
mutual
consent ,
and
not by
accident )
limited
and
lodged
in
more hands than one ; and the uni-
form preservation
of such
a consti-
tution
for
so
many
ages without
any
fundamental
change
demon-
strates the continuance
of the same
contract .
The consequences of such
a frame of government
are obvious :
that the laws
are the
rule to both ,
the common
measure of the power
of the Crown
and of the
obedience
of the
subject ;
and if the execu-
tive part endeavours the subversion
and total destruction
of the govern-
ment ,
the
original
contract
is
thereby
broken
and the right of
allegiance
ceases.

And this may be discovered
from
the very end and institution of civil states .
For a state
is a collective
body , composed of a multitude
of indivi-
duals , united for their safety and convenience , and intend-
ing to act together
as
one man . If it therefore is to act
as one man , it ought to act by one uniform
will .
But ,
inasmuch
as political communities
are
made up of many
natural
persons , each of whom has his particular will and
inclination ,
these
several wills
cannot by any
natural
union
be joined
together , or tempered
and disposed into
a lasting harmony , so as to constitute and produce
that
one uniform
will of the
whole .
It can therefore be no
otherwise
produced
than by a political
union ;
by the
consent of all persons to submit their own private wills to
the will of one man , or of one or more assemblies of men ,
to whom the supreme authority
is intrusted : and this will

Thus far as to the right of the
supreme power to make The duty to
laws ; but further , it is its duty likewise .
For , since the
respective members are bound
to conform
themselves to
the will
of the
state , it is
expedient
that
they
receive
directions from
the state declaratory of its will .
But , as
it is
impossible , in
so great a multitude
, to give injunc-
tions to every particular man , relative to each
particular
action , it is therefore
incumbent
on the state to establish
general rules , for the perpetual
information
and direction
of all persons in essential points , whether of positive
or
negative duty .
And this, in order that
every man may
know what

hands ; what

of

after

manner

state assigns him, in order to promote
and
secure
the
public tranquillity.
From what has been advanced, the truth of the former
of
the
defi- branch
of
our definition
is
(I
trust
)
sufficiently
evident
;
that
"
municipal
law
is
a
rule
of
civil conduct prescribed
by the supreme power
in
a
state
."
I
proceed now
to
the
latter
branch
of
it
;
that
it
is
a
rule
so

,
"
com-
manding
what

Now
,
in
order
to
do this completely
,
it
is
first
of
all
necessary that the
boundaries
of
right
and
wrong
be
established
and ascertained by law
.
And when this
is
once done
,
it
will follow
of
course
that
it
is
likewise
the
business
of
the law
,
considered
as
a
rule
of
civil
conduct
,
to
enforce the
rights
,
and
to
restrain
or
redress
the
wrongs
,
which have been ascertained
.
It
remains
,
there-
fore
,
only
to
consider
in
what
manner the law
is
said
to
ascertain the
boundaries
of
right
and wrong
;
and the
methods which
it
takes
to
command the
one and
to
pro-
hibit the other
.
For this purpose every law may
be
said
to
consist
of
several parts
:
one

is

and enjoined
to

,
and to abstain from the

:
a

;
whereby
a
method
is
pointed
out
to
recover
a

,
or

his

to
which may
be
added
a

the law
;
whereby
is
signified what evil
or
penalty shall be incurred by such
as
commit
any
public
wrong
,
and
transgress
or
neglect
their duty
.
With regard
to
the first
of
these
,
the declaratory part
of
the
municipal
law
,
this
mainly
depends upon
the
wisdom
and will of the
legislator
.
Those
rights

therefore
called
natural
rights , such
as life and liberty ,
may need the aid of human laws for their protection ; and
will receive additional
strength
when
declared
by the
municipal law to be
inviolable .
On the
contrary ,
no
human
legislature
would
be justified
in
abridging
or
destroying
those rights , unless the owner should himself
commit some act amounting
to a forfeiture of them .
So
divine
or natural duties (such , for instance , as the worship
of God, the maintenance of children , and the like) may
be enforced by and may receive sanction from
the law of
the land , being also declared to be duties by it.
The case
is the same as to criminal acts
forbidden by the superior
laws , and
sometimes
styled
mala in se, such as murder ,
theft , and perjury ; which contract some additional
degree
of turpitude
from being declared unlawful
by the inferior
legislature .
Albeit the legislature in all these cases acts
only in subordination
to the great
Lawgiver , transcribing
and publishing
His
precepts.
Thus
the declaratory part
of the municipal
law may be said to have some certain
force and operation with regard
even
to such actions
as
are naturally
and intrinsically right or wrong .
With regard to things in themselves indifferent , these
are often
regulated
by statute , and further
may become
either right or wrong , just or unjust , duties
or offences ,
according
as the
municipal
legislator
sees
fit
,
for
pro-
moting the welfare
of
society
,
and more effectually carrying
on the purposes of civil life
.
Thus our own common law
has declared
,
that the goods
of
the wife
do
instantly
upon
marriage become the property and right
of
the husband
;
and our statute law has declared smuggling
to
be
a
public
offence
:
yet
that right
and this
offence
have no founda-
tion
in
nature
;
they
are merely created
by the law
,
for
the purposes of civil society
.

And sometimes
,
where the

its

,
the parti-

of

,
as
the laws
of

,

as of natural religion : but who
those superiors
shall
be ,
and in what circumstances , or to what degrees , they shall
be obeyed , it is the province of human laws to determine .
And
so , as to injuries
or crimes , it must
be left to our
own legislature
to decide, in what
cases the
seizing an-
other's
cattle
shall
amount
to a trespass or a theft ; and
where it shall be a justifiable
action , as when
a landlord
takes them by way of distress for rent .
:
Thus much
for the declaratory
part of the municipal
law
and the
directory
stands
much
upon
the
same
footing ; for this virtually includes
the former , the decla-
ration
being
usually
collected from the
direction .
The
law which
says , " thou
shalt
not steal ," implies a decla-
ration
that
stealing
is a crime .
And we have
seen (r)
that , in things
naturally
indifferent , the
very
essence of
right and wrong depends upon the direction of the laws to
do or to omit them .
The remedial
part of a law is so
necessary
, that laws
must
be very
vague and imperfect
without
it.
For in
vain
would
rights
be
declared, in vain
directed
to be
observed, if there
were
no
method
of recovering
and
asserting
those rights, when wrongfully
withheld
or in-
vaded.
This is what
we mean ,
when
we speak of the
protection
of the law.
When ,
for
instance , the decla-
ratory part of the law has said , " that the field
or inhe-
ritance , which belonged to Titius's father , is vested by his
death in Titius :" and the directory
part has " forbidden
any one to enter on another's property , without
the leave
of the owner :" if Gaius , after this , will
presume to take
possession of the land , the remedial
part of the law will
then
interpose
its
office ; will
make
Gaius
restore the
possession to Titius , and also pay him damages for the
invasion .

public
duties ; it is
observable
that
human
legislators
have for the most
part
chosen to make the sanction of
their
laws
rather
vindicatory
than
remuneratory , i.e. , to
consist
rather in punishments , than in actual
particular
rewards .
Because, in the first place, the quiet enjoyment
and protection of our civil rights
and liberties , which
are
the
sure
and
general
consequence
of obedience to the
municipal law,
are in themselves
the
best
and
most
valuable of rewards .
Because also , were the
exercise of
every virtue
to be
enforced by the proposal of particular
rewards , it would
be impossible
for
any state to furnish
stock
enough for so profuse a bounty .
And further , be-
cause the dread of evil is a much more forcible
principle
of human action than the prospect of good (s) .
For which
reasons , though a prudent
bestowing of rewards
is some-
times of exquisite
use , yet we find that those civil laws ,
which
enforce and
enjoin
our duty , seldom , if ever , pro-
pose any privilege
or gift
to such
as
obey the law ; but
constantly come armed with
a penalty denounced against
transgressors ,
either
expressly
defining
the
nature
and
quantity
of their punishment ,
or
else
leaving it to the
discretion of the judges , and of those intrusted
with the
care of putting the laws in execution .
Where also a law regulates a matter in itself indifferent ,
some specific
ill
consequence
is
appointed
to
follow the
breach
or
non
-
observance
of
its requirements
.
Of all the parts
of
a
law the most
effectual
is
the
vindicatory
.
For
it
is
but lost labour
to
say
,
"
do this
,
or
avoid
that
,"
unless
we also declare
,
"
this
shall
be the
consequence of your non
-
compliance
."
We must there-
fore observe
,
that the
main
strength
and force
of
a
law
consists in the penalty
annexed
to
it
.
Herein
is
to
be
found the principal
obligation
of
human laws
.

laws

to

and

not that by any natural violence they

THE
NATURE
OF
LAWS
IN
GENERAL .
What mu-
nicipal laws
bind the
conscience.
a man , as to render it impossible for him to act otherwise
than as they direct , which
is the strict sense of obligation
:
but because , by declaring and exhibiting
a penalty against
offenders , they bring it to
pass
that
no man can easily
choose
to transgress
the law ;
since, by
reason of the
impending
correction ,
compliance
is in
a high
degree
preferable to disobedience .
And , even where rewards are
proposed as well
as
punishments
threatened , the
obliga-
tion of the law seems
chiefly to
consist in the penalty ;
for rewards , in their nature , can only persuade and allure ;
nothing is compulsory
but punishment .
Human laws
are, with the
reservation
already
no-
ticed (t) , binding upon
men's
consciences.
But if that
were the
only
or most forcible
obligation , the good only
would regard
the
laws ,
the
bad
would
set
them
at
defiance.
To perform
natural
duties ,
and to
abstain
from committing
such offences
as
are
mala in se, we are
bound in conscience, because
we are
bound by superior
laws ,
promulgated
before
our
municipal
laws
were in
being , to perform the one, and to abstain
from the other.
To those laws also which
enjoin
only positive duties , and
forbid
only such things
as are not mala
in se, but mala
prohibita merely , without
any intermixture
of moral guilt ,
annexing
a penalty to non-compliance , conscience
is con-
cerned, in yielding
obedience
and submission .
So in regard to rights-when the law has determined a
particular
field
to belong
to Titius , it is matter of con-
science
no longer
to withhold
or to invade it.
When a
contract or agreement has been entered
into , it is matter
of conscience
faithfully and fully to perform it.
I have now gone through the definition
laid down of a
municipal
law
and have shown that it is " a rule-of
civil
conduct-prescribed-by
the
supreme
power in a
state-commanding
what
is right ,
