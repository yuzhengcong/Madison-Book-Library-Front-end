to render the civil power subservient
to their purposes ,
by making
heresy not only a temporal , but even a capital
offence
; the Romish
ecclesiastics
determining , without
appeal , whatever
they pleased to be heresy , and shifting
off to the secular arm the odium and drudgery of execu
tions , with which
they themselves
were too tender and
delicate
to intermeddle .
Nay, they pretended to inter
cede and pray , on behalf of the convicted heretic , ut citra
mortis periculum
sententia
circa eum moderatur (m) : well
knowing
at the same time that they were delivering
the
unhappy
victim
to
certain
death .
Hence
the
capital
punishments
inflicted on the ancient Donatists
and Mani
chæans
by the
Emperors
Theodosius
and Justinian (n) :
hence
also
the
constitution
of
the
Emperor
Frederic
mentioned
by
Lyndewode (o) ;
adjudging
all
persons
without distinction
to
be burnt with fire
,
who were con
victed
of
heresy by the
ecclesiastical
judge
.
The
same
emperor
,
in
another constitution
(p
),
ordained that
if
any
temporal
lord
,
when
admonished by the church
,
should
neglect
to
clear his territories
of
heretics within
a
year
,
it
should be lawful for good catholics
to
seize and occupy
the lands
,
and utterly
to
exterminate
the heretical pos
sessors
.
And upon this
foundation
was built that arbi
trary power
,
so
long claimed and
so
fatally exerted by the
pope
,
of
disposing
even
of
the kingdoms
of
refractory
princes
to
more dutiful sons
of
the church
.
The imme
diate event
of
this
constitution
was something
singular
,
and may serve
to
illustrate
at
once
the gratitude
of
the
holy see
,
and the just punishment
of
the royal bigot
:
for
upon the authority
of
this very constitution
,
the pope after
wards
expelled the Emperor
Frederic
from
his
kingdom
of
Sicily
,
and gave
it
to
Charles
of
Anjou
(9).
Christianity being thus deformed by the demon
of
per
secution
upon the continent
,

own island should be entirely free from the same scourge.
And accordingly we find among our ancient precedents (r)
a writ de hæretico
comburendo , which
is thought
by some
to be as ancient
as the common law itself.
However it
appears from thence, that the conviction of heresy by the
common law was not in any petty ecclesiastical court , but
before the archbishop himself in a provincial
synod ;
and
that the delinquent
was
delivered
over to the temporal
power
so that the crown had a control over the
spiritual
power , and might pardon the convict by issuing
no pro
cess
against him ; the writ de hæretico
comburendo
being
not
a writ of
course , but
issuing
only by the
special
direction of the sovereign in council (s).
But in the reign of Henry the Fourth , when the
eyes
of the christian
world began to open , and the seeds of the
protestant
religion
(though
under the opprobrious
name
of Lollardy (t) ) ,
took
root in this kingdom , the
clergy ,
emboldened by the king's
dubious
title
to
demand
an
increase of their
own
power , obtained an act of parlia
ment (u) , which sharpened the edge of persecution
to
its
utmost
keenness
.
For
,
by that
statute
,
the
diocesan
alone
,
without the intervention
of
a
synod
,
might convict
of
heretical
tenets
;
and unless the convict
abjured
his
opinions
,
or
if
after abjuration
he relapsed
,
the sheriff was
bound
ex
officio
,
if
required
by the bishop
,
to
commit the
unhappy
victim
to
the
flames
,
without
waiting
for the
consent of the crown
.
By the
statute
2

c.

Lollardy was also made
a
temporal offence
,
and indictable
in
the king's courts
;
which did not thereby gain
an ex
clusive jurisdiction
,
but one concurrent with the bishop's
consistory
.

began
to
advance ,
the
power of the
ecclesiastics
was
somewhat moderated : for though what heresy is , was not
then precisely
defined , we
are told in some points what it
is not
the statute 25 Hen .
8,
c.
14 , declaring
offences
against the see of Rome not to be heresy ; and the ordi-
nary being thereby restrained from proceeding in any case
upon mere suspicion ; that is, unless the party were accused
by two credible
witnesses , or
an
indictment
of heresy
were first found in the courts of common law.
And yet
the spirit of persecution was not
then
abated , but only
diverted into a lay channel .
For in six years afterwards ,
by statute
31
Hen.
8 , c. 14, the
bloody law of the six
articles
was
made , which
established
the six most
con-
tested
points
of popery , transubstantiation
, communion
in
one kind, the celibacy of the
clergy , monastic vows,
the sacrifice of the mass , and auricular
confession ; which
points were " determined and resolved by the most godly
study , pain ,
and travail of his
majesty : for which
his
most humble
and obedient
subjects , the
lords
spiritual
and temporal , and the commons , in parliament
assembled
,
did not only render and give unto his highness their most
high and hearty thanks ," but did also enact and declare
all oppugners of the first to be heretics , and to be burnt
with fire ; and of the five last to be felons , and to suffer
death .
The
same statute established
a new and
mixed
jurisdiction of clergy and laity for the trial and conviction
of heretics ; the reigning
prince being then equally intent
on destroying
the supremacy of the bishops of Rome , and
establishing
all
other their corruptions
of the
christian
religion.
I shall
not perplex this detail with the various
repeals
and revivals of these sanguinary
laws in the two succeed-
ing reigns ;
but
shall
proceed directly
to the
reign
of
Queen Elizabeth ; when the reformation
was finally esta-
blished .
By statute
1 Eliz . c.
1 , all former
enactments
relating
to heresy were repealed, the jurisdiction
as to
heresy being left
as it stood
at common law ; viz.,
as

regarded the infliction
of common
censures, in the
eccle
siastical
courts ; and , in case of burning the heretic , in
the
provincial
synod
only (x) .
Sir
Matthew
Hale
is
indeed of a different
opinion , and holds that
such power
resided in the
diocesan also, though
he
agrees , that in
either
case
the writ
de
hæretico
comburendo
was
not
demandable of common right, but grantable or otherwise
merely at the discretion of the crown (y) .
The principal
point , however , now gained
was, that by this
statute a
boundary
was for the first time
set to what
should
be
accounted heresy ; nothing
for the future
being to be so
determined , but only such tenets , which
had been there
tofore
so
declared :
1.
By the words of the canonical
scriptures ; 2. By the first four
general
councils , or such
others as had only used the words of the holy scriptures ;
or, 3. Which should thereafter
be
so
declared by parlia
ment , with the assent of the clergy in convocation .
Thus
was heresy reduced to a greater
certainty
than
before ;
though it might not have been the worse to have defined
it in terms still
more precise and particular
: as
a man
continued still liable to be burnt, for what perhaps he did
not understand to be heresy until the ecclesiastical judge
so interpreted the words of the canonical scriptures .
For the writ de hæretico
comburendo
remained
still
in
force ; and we have instances of its being put in execution
upon
two
anabaptists in the seventeenth of Elizabeth
,
and upon
two Arians in the ninth of James I.
But it
was totally abolished , and heresy again subjected only to
ecclesiastical
correction pro salute animo , by virtue of
the statute 29
Car . 2 , c. 9.
For in
one
and the
same
reign , our lands were delivered from the
slavery of mili
tary tenures (*) , our bodies from
arbitrary
imprisonment
on criminal charges by the habeas
corpus act (a) , and our
minds in some measure from the tyranny of superstitious

horrible

From this period heresy was dispunishable
by our law,
until the legislature
thought proper that
the civil magis

of
it, at one time
prevalent ; for the statute

some
especial portions
of
it

The penal statutes formerly enacted
in

to
Roman

must
be
accounted
for by the
urgency
of
the
times
at
which
they originated
.
The
restless machina

of
the Jesuits during the reign

the
turbulence
and uneasiness
of

duced the parliament
to counteract so dangerous
a spirit
by severely penal laws .
The powder -treason , in the suc
ceeding reign , struck a panic into James I. , which operated
in different ways : it occasioned the enacting of new laws
against the papists , but deterred him from putting them
in execution .
The
intrigues
of Queen Henrietta
in the
reign of Charles I. , the prospect of a popish
successor in
that of Charles II. , the assassination -plot in the reign of
King William , and the avowed
claim of a
popish
pre
tender to the
crown
in that and subsequent reigns , will
account for the infliction of such penalties at those several
periods of our history .
In order the better to secure the
church of England
re-established on the accession of Queen Elizabeth by the
Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity ( d) —against perils from
nonconformists , jews , catholics , and other sectaries , two
bulwarks
were
during
the reign of Charles II.
erected .
By the
Corporation
Act (e) ,
no
person
could
be legally
elected
to
any office
relating
to the government of any
city
or corporation , unless , within
a twelvemonth
pre
viously ,
he
had
received
the
sacrament of the Lord's
Supper according
to the rites of the church of England ;
he was also enjoined
to take the oaths of allegiance
and
supremacy at the same time
that he took the
oath of
office
and , in default of either of these requisites , such
election was avoided .
By the Test Act (f) , all officers
,
civil and military, were directed
to take the
oaths , and
make the declaration
against
transubstantiation
, in any
of the courts at Westminster
, or at the quarter
sessions ,
within six calendar
months
after their admission ; and
also within the same time to receive the sacrament of the
Lord's
Supper , according
to the usage of the church of
(d) 1 Eliz . cc. 1 & 2.

and

into
court
a certificate
thereof
signed
by the minister
and churchwarden , and also to prove the
same by two credible witnesses ; upon
forfeiture of 500 .
and disability
to hold the said office .
These enactments necessarily excluded
as well catholic
as
protestant
nonconformists
from
civil
and
military
offices , and their
operation
was afterwards
extended by
the statutes below cited (g) .
The penal laws directed
against papists might formerly
have
been
divided
into
three
classes
:
1. Those which
concerned lay persons professing
popery ;
2.
Those which
concerned
popish recusants convict ; and, 3. Those which
concerned
popish
priests .
1.
Persons
professing
the
popish
religion ,
besides
being
subject to
penalties
for
not frequenting
their
parish
church , were disabled from
taking land either
by descent or purchase ,
after eighteen
years
of
age , until they
renounced
their
errors :
they
were required at the age of twenty -one
to register their
estates , and all future conveyances
and wills
relating
to
them ; they were incapable of presenting to any advow
son , or granting
to any other person any avoidance of the
same ; they
could
not
keep or
teach any school
under
pain of perpetual
imprisonment
;
and if they
said
or
heard mass , they incurred
pecuniary penalties and impri
sonment .
Moreover , if any person
sent
another
abroad
to be educated
in the popish religion , or to reside
in any
religious
house abroad for that purpose , or contributed
to
his maintenance when
there ; the sender, the sent , and
the
contributor , were
each
disabled
to
sue in law
or
equity , to be executor
or administrator
to any person , to
take any legacy or deed of gift , and to bear any office in
the realm , and incurred
a forfeiture of goods and chattels ,
and of real
estate
for life .

aggravated

ciled , to the see of Rome , the offence
amounted
to high
treason.
2. Popish recusants , convicted in a court of law
of not
attending
the
service of the church of England ,
were subject to the following
disabilities , penalties , and
forfeitures , over and above those before mentioned .
They
were considered
as persons excommunicated ; they could
hold no office or employment ; they were forbidden to keep
arms in their houses , and the
same , if kept
there , might
be seized by justices of the
peace ; they could
not.come
within ten miles of London , on pain of 100 %.; they could
bring no action
at law, or suit in equity ; they were not
permitted to travel above five miles from home , unless by
licence ,
upon
pain
of forfeiting
their
goods ;
and
they
might not come to court
under pain of 100 %.
No mar-
riage or burial of such recusant , or baptism of his
child ,
could
be
had
otherwise
than
by the ministers
of the
church
of
England ,
under
other
severe
penalties .
A
married woman , when recusant , forfeited two-thirds of her
dower or jointure , could not be executrix or administratrix
to her
husband ,
nor
have
any part of his goods ; and
during the coverture might be kept in prison , unless her

Popish

were
in a still more dangerous condition .
For by statute

12 Will .
3 ,
c.
4 , popish
priests
or bishops , celebrating
mass, or exercising
any part of their functions in Eng
land , except in the houses
of ambassadors , were liable to
perpetual
imprisonment .
And by the statute
27 Eliz .

priest , born in the dominions
of the
crown
of England , who should
come
over hither
from
beyond sea (unless driven by stress of weather , and tarry

only a reasonable time (i)) , or should be in England
three days without
conforming
and taking
the oaths, was
guilty of high treason : and all persons harbouring
him
were guilty of felony , and were capitally
punishable .
This is a short
summary of the laws formerly in force
against
the papists , under
their
three several classes , of
persons
professing
the popish
religion , popish recusants
convict , and popish
priests .
Concerning
which the Pre

Montesquieu
observed
(k) ,
that
they
were
so
rigorous , though
not professedly of the sanguinary kind ,
that they did all the hurt that
could
possibly be done in
cold blood ; though
in answer to this it may be observed
that
these
laws
were
seldom
exerted
to their utmost
rigour.
The penal enactments
above referred to have , however ,
by various statutes passed
during the preceding
and the
present
century , been
mitigated
or repealed ; they were
in part mitigated
by statute 18 Geo. 3, c. 60 , with regard
to such papists as duly took the oath therein
prescribed ,
of allegiance , abjuration of the Pretender , renunciation of
the pope's civil power , and abhorrence of the doctrines of

Further, by the statute

many of the
severe restrictions
and penalties already enumerated , were
removed from those
Roman catholics who were willing to
comply with the requisitions of that
statute ;-that they
must appear at one of the
courts at Westminster
,
or at
the quarter -sessions
held for the county , city, or place of
their
residence,
and
make
and
subscribe a declaration ,
that they professed
the Roman
catholic religion , and also
an oath similar

and by 43
Geo .

Roman

Geo.

as if they had
taken
the
oath
therein
prescribed .
On this declaration
and oath being
duly made by any Roman catholic , the officer of the court
was directed to grant him a certificate : and such officer
was required to transmit yearly to the privy council lists of
all persons who had thus qualified themselves in his court
within the year .
The 31 Geo. 3 , c. 32 , then provided (1) ,
that a Roman catholic , thus qualified , should not be pro
secuted
under
any statute for not repairing
to a parish
church , nor for being
a papist , nor for

performing

shall have its

offence against

For, besides the
notorious
indecency
and
scandal of permitting any secular business to be publicly
transacted
on that day, in a country
professing
chris
tianity , and the
corruption
of morals which
must follow
its profanation , the keeping
one day in seven holy , as a
time of relaxation
and refreshment
as well as for public
worship , is of
admirable
service
to a state ,
considered
merely as a civil institution
.
It humanizes
the manners
of the lower
classes
; it enables the industrious
workman
to pursue his occupation in the ensuing week with health
and cheerfulness : it imprints
on the minds of the people
that sense
of their duty to God , so necessary to make
them
good citizens
; but which yet would
be worn
out
and
defaced by an
unremitted
continuance
of labour ,
without any stated times of recalling them to the worship

CHAPTER VI.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE LAW OF NATIONS .
ACCORDING
to the method marked out in the preceding
chapter , we are next to consider offences more immediately
repugnant to that universal law of society, which regulates
the mutual
intercourse
between one
state and
another ;
or, at all events , such of them as are particularly
animad-
verted on by the English law.
The law of nations
is a system of rules , deducible
by
natural reason , and established by universal consent among
the
civilised
inhabitants
of the world (a) ; in
order to
decide disputes , to regulate
ceremonies and civilities , and
to insure the observance of justice and good faith , in that
intercourse which
must
frequently occur between two
or
more independent
states , and the individuals
belonging
to
each of them (b). This general law is founded upon the prin-
ciple
that
different nations ought in time of peace to do
one another all the good they can ; and in time of war as
little harm
as
possible , without
prejudice
to their own
real
interests (c) .
And ,
as
none of these
states
will
allow a superiority
in the other , therefore
neither
can
dictate or prescribe the rules of this law to the rest ; but
such
rules must
necessarily result
from
those principles
of natural
justice , in which
the
learned of every nation
agree ; or they depend upon mutual
compacts or treaties
between the respective communities ; in the construction
of which there
is also no judge to resort to, but the law

GENERAL
OBSERVATIONS .
75
of nature
and
reason , being the only one with which the
contracting
parties are equally conversant , and to which
they are equally subject .
In
arbitrary
states this
law, wherever it
contradicts.
or is not provided for by the municipal
law of the country ,
is enforced by the royal power ; but
since in England no
royal power can introduce
a new law , or suspend the exe
cution of the old , therefore the law of nations (wherever
any question
arises which
is properly
the
object of its
jurisdiction ) is
here adopted in
its full
extent by the
common
law , and
is held to be a part of the law of the
land.
And
those
acts
of parliament
which
have from
time to time been made to enforce this universal law, or
to facilitate the execution of its
decisions , are not to be
considered as introductive of any new rule , but merely as
declaratory
of the old fundamental
constitutions
of the
kingdom
: without
which it must cease to be a part of the
civilised
world .
Thus in mercantile
questions , such
as
bills of exchange and the like : in marine causes , relating
to freight , average, demurrage , insurances , bottomry , and
others of a similar
nature ; the law-merchant (d), which
is a branch of the law of nations , is regularly
and con
stantly
adhered
to.
And whensoever international
ques
tions yet more momentous arise, there is no other rule of
decision but this great universal
law , collected from his
tory
and
usage,
and
such
writers
of all
nations
and
languages as are generally approved and allowed of.
But , though in civil transactions
and questions of pro
perty between the subjects of different
states , the law of
nations ,
as
adopted by the law of England, has much
scope and extent , yet the present branch of our inquiries will
fall within a narrow compass
, since an offence
against the
law of nations can rarely be the object of the criminal law
of any particular
state.
For offences
against this law are
principally incident
to whole
states
or nations ; in which
case
recourse can only be had to war ; which is an appeal

to the God of hosts , to punish
such infractions
of public
faith, as are committed by one independent people against
another
neither state having
any superior jurisdiction to
resort to upon
earth for justice .
But where
the indi
viduals of any state violate this general law , it is then the
interest as well as duty of the government , under which
they
live , to animadvert
upon
them
with
a becoming
severity , that the peace of the world may be maintained .
For
in vain
would
nations
in their
collective
capacity
observe
these universal
rules , if private
subjects were at
liberty to break them at their own discretion , and involve
the two states
in a war .
It is therefore incumbent upon
the nation injured , first to demand satisfaction and justice
to be done on the offender , by the
state
to
which
he
belongs ; and , if that be refused or neglected , the sove
reign avows himself an accomplice or abettor of his sub
ject's crime , and draws upon his community the calamities
of foreign war .
The principal
offences
against the law of nations , ani
madverted on as such by the municipal
laws of England ,
are of three
kinds :
1. Violation
of
safe-conducts ;
2.
Infringement
of
the
rights
of
ambassadors ;
and ,
3 .
Piracy .
I. As to the first,
violation
of
safe -conducts (e)
or
passports , expressly granted by the crown
or its ambas
sadors (f) to the subjects of a foreign
power in time of
mutual war ; or committing
acts of hostility against such
as
are in amity , league , or truce with
us , and
are here
under a general implied
safe -conduct : these are breaches
of the
public
faith , without
the
preservation
of which
there
can be no intercourse
or commerce between
one
nation and another : and any such offence
may , according
to the writers upon the law of nations , constitute
a just
ground of war ; since it is not in the power of the foreign

And
as during the
continuance
of
any safe-conduct , either express
or implied , the foreigner
is under
the
protection
of the
sovereign
and the law :
and , more especially , as it is one of the articles of magna
carta , that foreign merchants should be entitled
to safe

and security throughout
the kingdom
: there is
no question
but that
any violation of either the
person
or property
of such foreigner
may be punished

has renounced
the benefits of society and
government
,
and
has reduced himself afresh to the savage state of
nature , by declaring war against mankind , mankind
must
declare war against him : so that every community
has a
right , by the rule of self- defence , to inflict that
punish
ment upon him, which every individual
would
in a state
of nature
have been otherwise
entitled
to inflict , for an
invasion of his person or property .
By the ancient
common law, piracy , if committed by a
subject , was held
to be a species
of treason, being
con
trary
to his
natural
allegiance
;
and by an alien
to be
felony only
but , since the statute of treason , 25 Edw . 3 ,
st. 5, c . 2 , it was held to be only felony in a subject (m).
Formerly it was only cognisable
by the admiralty
courts ,
the proceedings in which were mainly
regulated
by the
rules
of the
civil law (n) .
But it

inconsistent

according to the course of the com

The offence of piracy , at common law, consists in com
mitting those
acts of robbery
and depredation
upon the
high seas , which , if committed
upon
land , would
have
amounted
to
felony
there (o).
But ,
by statute ,
some
other offences
are made piracy also : as by statute

80
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
LAW
OF NATIONS .
It seems
always
to have been considered , that if any
of the crew or passengers of a vessel were taken for the
purpose of being sold as slaves , this was piracy at common
law (8).
And
by the
statute
5
Geo . 4,
c.
113 ,
it is
expressly enacted
(s . 9 ) , that any subject of the sovereign
or any person residing
or being in any of the dominions
of the crown , or on the high
seas (which
is further ex
tended , by the 6 & 7 Vict .
c. 98 , s .
1 , to British
subjects
wheresoever residing
and being ,
and whether within the
dominions of the British crown or of any foreign
country ,)
who shall convey or remove any person as a slave , shall
be guilty of piracy , felony , and robbery (t).
By sect.
10 ,
the dealing for , purchasing
or bartering
persons as slaves ,
or fitting out or navigating
any ship for this purpose , or
in any way being connected
with the traffic in slaves, is like
wise made felonious ; and by sect .
11 , the
embarking
on
board of any vessel as a petty officer or seaman , knowing
that such vessel is to be employed in the traffic in slaves ,
is constituted a misdemeanor (u).
Treaties have also been
entered into ,
under
the
authority
of
parliament , with
many
foreign
nations
and
states , for extending
similar
enactments to the ships and subjects of those countries (x).
These are the principal
cases , in which the statute law
of England interposes
to
aid
and
enforce
the
law
of
nations ,
as
a
part of the common law : by inflicting
punishment
upon
offences
against
that law,
committed
by private
persons.

proceed in the next two

offences
which more

affect the sovereign and the government .

CHAPTER VII.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
SOVEREIGN .
THE third general
division
of crimes consists of such
as more especially affect the
supreme executive power ,-
which
amount either to a total renunciation
of allegiance ,
or at the least to a criminal neglect of that duty , which
is due from every subject to the sovereign and the govern-
ment .
We have already (a ) had occasion
to mention the nature
of allegiance , as the tie or ligamen which binds every sub-
ject to be true and faithful to his
sovereign liege lord , in
return
for
that
protection
which
is afforded him ;
and
truth and faith to bear of life
and limb ,
and earthly
honour ; and
not
to know or
hear of any ill intended
against
his sovereign , without
defending
him
therefrom .
And this allegiance , we may remember , was distinguished
into two species
: the one natural
and perpetual , which is
inherent only in natives , or natural
born
subjects of the
crown ; the other local
and temporary , which is incident
to aliens.
Every offence
more immediately
affecting the
royal
person ,
the
regal
crown
or dignity, is in
some
degree a breach of this duty of allegiance , whether natural
and innate , or local and acquired by residence : and
such
offences may be referred to two classes
; 1st. Treason , and
other
offences , misprisions
and
contempts
against
the
sovereign ; and , 2ndly . Offences against the government .
I. Treason , in its very name (which is borrowed from the I. High
French ) imports a betraying , treachery , or breach of faith .

:

It
therefore
happens
only
between

saith
the
Mirror (b)
treason indeed was formerly
made use of by
the law as a general
appellation , to denote not only an
offence
against
the sovereign , but also that accumulation
of guilt which
arises
whenever a superior
reposes
a confi
dence in a subject or inferior , between whom
and himself
there
subsists a natural , a civil , or even
a spiritual rela
tion
and the inferior
so abuses
that confidence , so forgets
the obligations of duty , subjection , and allegiance
;
as to
destroy the life of any such
superior
or lord (c) .
This
was looked upon as proceeding from the same principle of
treachery in private
life ,
as would
have urged him who
harbours it to have conspired in public against
his liege
lord
and sovereign ; and therefore
for a wife to kill her
lord or husband , a servant
his lord or master , and an
ecclesiastic his lord or ordinary
: these , being breaches of
the lower allegiance , of private
and domestic faith , were
formerly denominated petit treasons.
But when disloyalty
so reared
its
crest
,
as
to
attack even majesty itself
,
it
was
called by way
of
eminent
distinction
high treason
,
alta
proditio
;
being equivalent
to
the crimen læsae
majestatis
of
the Romans
,
as
Glanvil
(
)
denominates
it
also
in
our
English law
.
As this
is
the highest civil crime
,
which
(
considered
as
a
member
of
the community
)
any
man
can
possibly
commit
,
it
ought therefore
to
be
the most precisely ascer
tained
.
For
if
the crime
of
high treason
be
indeterminate
,
this
alone
(
says
Montesquieu
)
is
sufficient
to
make
a
government
degenerate into
arbitrary
power
(e).
And
yet
,
by the ancient
common law
,
there was
a
great lati
tude left
in
the breast
of
the judges
to
determine what
was treason
,
or
not
so
:
whereby the creatures
of
tyran
nical
princes
had
opportunity
to
create
abundance
of
constructive
treasons

arbitrary constructions , offences
to the degree of treason
which never had been suspected
to be such .
Thus
the
accroaching ,
or attempting
to
exercise,
royal
power
(a
very
uncertain
charge )
was in the
21 Edw .
3 held
to
be
treason in a knight of
Hertfordshire , who
forcibly
assaulted and detained one of the king's subjects till he
paid him 90 %. (ƒ) : a crime , it must be owned , well deserving
of punishment
; but which seems
to be of a complexion
very different from that of treason.
Killing
the
father ,
or brother , or even the messenger , of the sovereign , has
also fallen under the
same
denomination (g) , the doctrine
applied in the latter
case being
almost
as
tyrannical
as
that of the imperial
constitution
of Arcadius
and Hono
rius , which
determined
that
any
attempts
or
designs
against
the ministers
of the prince should be treason (h) .
To prevent , however , the inconveniences which began to
arise in
England
from
this

existing treasons.

Under this description it is held
that a queen regnant
(such as Queen Elizabeth, Queen
Anne, and her present most gracious Majesty Queen Vic
toria ) is within the words of the act, being invested with
royal
power , and
entitled
to the allegiance of her
sub
jects ( ); but the husband of such a queen is not comprised
within these words , and therefore no treason can be com
mitted
against
him ( ).
The king here intended
is the
king in possession , without any respect to his
title : for
it is held that a king de facto and not dejure , or, in other
words , an usurper who has got possession of the throne ,
is a king within the meaning of the statute : as there is a
temporary allegiance
due to him, for
his
administration
of the
government ,
and
temporary
protection
of the
public
and
accordingly
treasons
committed
against
Henry VI. were punished
under
Edward IV. , though all
the line of Lancaster had been previously declared usurpers
by act of parliament .
But the most rightful heir of the
crown , or king de jure
and not
de facto, who has
never
had plenary possession of the throne , as was the
case of
the house of York during the three reigns of the line of
Lancaster , is not a king within this statute against whom
treasons
may be
committed
(m ).
And
a very
sensible
writer on the crown -law lays
such stress on the point of
possession as to hold ( n ) , that a king out of possession
is
so far from
having
any right to our allegiance , by any
other title which he may set up against the king in being ,
that we are bound by the duty of our allegiance
to resist
him.
A doctrine which he grounds
upon the statute

1 , which
is
declaratory
of the
common
law,
and pronounces all subjects
excused
from any penalty

in truth , this seems to be confounding all notions of right
and wrong ; and

consequence
would
be, that

Cromwell had put to death the elder Charles , and assumed
the power (though
not the
name) of king , the
people
were bound in duty to hinder
the
son's restoration : and
were some foreign potentate to invade this kingdom , and
by any means to get possession of the crown (a term , by
the way, of very loose and indistinct signification ) , the
subject would be bound by his
allegiance
to fight for his
natural prince to -day, and by the same duty of allegiance
to fight
against
him
to-morrow .
The
true
distinction.
seems to be, that
the statute of Henry VII . does by no
means command
any opposition
to a king
de jure ; but
excuses
the
obedience
paid
to a king de facto.
When
therefore
an
usurper
is
in
possession
,
the
subject is
excused and justified
in obeying
and giving him
assist-
ance : otherwise , under
an usurpation , no man
could
be
safe : if the lawful
prince
had a right to hang him for
obedience to the powers in being ,
as the usurper would
certainly do for disobedience .
Nay, further ,
as the mass
of people are imperfect
judges
of title , of which
in all
cases possession is primâ facie evidence , the law compels
no man to yield obedience to that
prince , whose right is
by want of possession rendered uncertain and disputable ,
till Providence
shall think
fit
to
interpose
in
his favour
,
and decide
the ambiguous
claim
:
and therefore
,
till he
is
entitled
to
such allegiance by possession
,
no treason can
be
committed
against
him
.
Lastly
,
a
king
who
has
resigned his crown
,
such resignation
being
admitted and
ratified
in
parliament
,
is
according
to
sir Matthew Hale
no
longer the object
of
treason
(o).
And the same reason
holds
,
in
case
a
king abdicates the government
:
or
,
by
actions
subversive of the constitution
,
virtually renounces
the authority
which
he claims by that very constitution
:
since
,
as
was formerly
observed
(p
),
when
the
fact
of
abdication
is
once
established
,
and
determined
by the
proper judges
,
the
consequence
necessarily
follows
,
that
the throne
is
thereby vacant
,
and he
is
no longer king

OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
SOVEREIGN .
Let us next
see , what
is a " compassing " or " im
or imagining agining " the
death
of the
sovereign , &c.
These
are
What is a
compassing
synonymous terms ; the word
" compass " signifying the
purpose or design of the mind or will (9) , and not , as in
common speech, the carrying
such design into effect (r).
And
therefore
an accidental
stroke , which may mortally
wound
the
sovereign ,
per
infortunium ,
without
any
traitorous
intent , is no treason : as was the
case of sir
Walter Tyrrel , by the command of king William
Rufus ,
shooting
at a hart , whose arrow
glanced
against
a tree ,
and killed the king upon the spot (s).
But , as this com
passing
or imagination
is an act of the mind , it cannot
possibly fall under any judicial
cognizance , unless it be
demonstrated by some
open , or overt
act (†).
And yet
the tyrant Dionysius
is recorded (u) to have executed a
subject, barely
for dreaming
that he
had
killed
him
;
which was held for a sufficient proof, that he had thought
thereof in his waking
hours .
Such
however is not the
temper of the English law ; and therefore in this , and the
three next species
of treason , it is necessary that
there
appear an open or overt act of a more full and explicit
nature to convict the traitor upon .
The statute expressly
requires , that
the
accused " be
thereof
upon
sufficient
proof attainted of some open act by men of his own con
(2) According
to our ancient law ,

or

(t) In the proceedings
against the
regicides
(5 St. Tr . 947), the indict
ment charged ,
that
they
did trai
torously
compass
and imagine
the
death of the king , the taking off
his
head was laid as an
overt
act
of compassing , and the person who
was supposed
to
have
given
the
stroke was convicted
on the indict
ment .
For the
compassing
is con
sidered
as the
treason ,
the
overt
acts as the means made
use of to
effectuate
the
intentions
of
the
heart .
And
in
every
indictment
for this species of treason , and in
deed for levying war ,
or
adhering
to the king's enemies , an
overt
act
must
be alleged
and
proved .
For
the

charge , to
which the
prisoner
must
apply his
defence .

dition (c)."
Thus , to provide weapons or ammunition
for
the purpose of killing the king , has been held
to be a
palpable
overt act of treason in imagining
his death (y) .
To conspire to
imprison
the king
by
force,
and move
towards
it by assembling
company , is an
overt
act of
compassing
the king's death (2) ; for all force , used to
the person of the sovereign, in its
consequence
may tend
to his death, and is a strong
presumption of something
worse
intended than
the present
force , by such as have
so far thrown off their
bounden
duty to their sovereign ;
it being an old observation , that
there is generally but a
short
interval
between
the
prisons
and the graves of
princes .
There is no question also, but that taking
any
measures
to render such treasonable purposes effectual , as
assembling and consulting
on the means to kill the sove-
reign, is a sufficient overt act of high treason (a).

"In the
case of the king the
statute
of treasons
has , with great
propriety , retained
the rule volun-
tas pro facto .
The
principle
upon
which this is founded is too obvious
to
need
much
enlargement .
The
king is considered
as the head of
the body -politic, and the members
of that
body
are
considered
as
united and kept together by a poli-
tical union with him and with each
other .
His life cannot , in the ordi-
nary course of things , be taken away
by
treasonable
practices , without
involving
a whole nation
in blood
and confusion
; consequently
every
stroke
levelled
at his
person
is, in
the
ordinary
course
of
things,
levelled
at the public tranquillity .
The
law
therefore
tendereth
the
safety of the king with an anxious
concern ; and , if I may use the ex-
pression , with
a concern
bordering
upon jealousy .
It considereth
the
wicked
imaginations
of the
heart ,
in
the
same degree of guilt
as if
carried into actual
execution , from
the
moment
measures
appear to
have
been taken
to
render
them
effectual .
And,
therefore , if con-
spirators
meet
and
consult
how to
kill the king, though
they do not
then fall upon
any scheme for that
purpose , this is an overt act of com-
passing
his
death ;
and
so are all
means made use of, be it advice ,
persuasion ,
or command , to incite
or encourage others
to
commit the
fact , or join in the
attempt
; and
every person who
but assenteth to
airy overtures for that
purpose will
be involved
in the same guilt .
"The care the law hath taken
for the personal
safety of the king
is not confined
to
actions

Whether
words are
How far mere words , spoken by an individual
, and
not
treasonable. relative to any treasonable act or design then in agitation ,
shall
amount
to
treason , has
been
formerly
matter
of
doubt .
Instances
are
reported (b) of persons who
have
been executed for treasonable words .
But now it seems
clearly to be agreed, that by the
common law and the
statute of Edw .
3 words
spoken amount per se only to
a high misdemeanor ,
and
no
treason .
For
they
may
be spoken in heat , without
any intention , or be mistaken ,
perverted ,
or
mis -remembered
by the
hearers ;
their
meaning
depends always
on their connection with other
words ,
and
things ;
they
may
signify differently
even
according to the
tone of voice with which they are de
livered ; and sometimes silence itself is more expressive
than any discourse .
As therefore
there
can be nothing
more
equivocal
and
ambiguous
than
words , it
would
indeed be unreasonable
to make them amount to high
treason.
And accordingly in 4 Car .
1 , on
a reference to
the judges , concerning
some words spoken by one Pine ,
they certified
to the king , " that though the words were
as wicked
as might be, yet they were no treason
for
unless it be by some
particular
statute , no words will be
treason (c)." If the words

to assassination
or poison , or other
attempts
directly
and immediately
aiming
at his life. It is extended
to every thing wilfully
and delibe
rately
done or
attempted , whereby
his life may be endangered .
And ,
therefore , the entering into measures
for deposing
or imprisoning
him, or
to get his person into the
power of
the conspirators ,-these
offences are
overt
acts of treason
within
this
branch of the statute ."
Fost . 194.
This was the
species of
treason
with which the state-prisoners
were
charged in 1794.
And the question ,
as stated by the court for the jury
to try, was , whether their measures
had been entered into with an intent
to subvert
the
monarchy
and
to
depose the king ?

And this
may be done by taking arms , not
only to dethrone
the
king , but under pretence to reform religion , or the laws ,
or to remove evil counsellors , or other grievances whether
real or pretended (g) .
For the law does not , neither can
it, permit
any private
man , or set of men , to interfere
forcibly in matters of such high importance
; especially
as it has established a sufficient power , for these purposes ,

a

But to relieve
a rebel , fled
out of the kingdom , is no
treason
for the
statute
is
taken
strictly , and
a rebel is not an enemy : an enemy
being always the subject of some
foreign
prince , and one
who owes no allegiance to the crown of England
(r) .
And
if a person
be under
circumstances of actual force
and
constraint ,
through
a well -grounded
apprehension
of
injury to his life
or
person , this
fear or compulsion will
excuse his
even joining with either
rebels or enemies in
the kingdom , provided he leaves
them whenever he has a
safe opportunity (s).
With reference
to the three last species of high treason
must
here be cited the statute 7 & 8 Will . 3 , c. 3, which
enacts (sect . 2) that no person
shall be convicted of high
treason or misprision
of treason (t) ,
" but by and upon
the oaths and testimony of two lawful witnesses , either
both of them to the same overt act, or one of them to one
and the other of them
to
another
overt act of the
same
treason ,"
unless
the party
indicted
and arraigned
shall
confess the same
; this statute , however , does not extend
to " cases of high treason in compassing or imagining the
death of the king , and of misprision of such treason , where

alleged in the indictment for such offence
shall be assassi
nation or killing of the king , or any direct attempt against
his life , or any direct attempt
against his person whereby
his life may be endangered or his person may suffer bodily
harm ;" but the individual indicted for any such offence
as just specified shall be tried " in every respect
and upon
the like evidence " as if he stood charged with murder (u).
Thus careful was the legislature , in the reign of Edw .
III.,
to
specify
and
reduce to
a
certainty
the
vague
notions
of treason , which had formerly
prevailed
in
our
courts .
But the act does not stop here , it goes on thus :
-" Because other like
cases of treason may happen in
time to come , which cannot be thought of nor declared at
present , it is accorded, that if any other
cause
supposed
to be treason, which
is not above specified , doth happen
before any judge ; the judge
shall tarry without going to
judgment of the treason , till the
cause
be shewed and
declared before the king
and his parliament , whether it
ought to be judged
treason , or other felony ."
Sir Mat
thew Hale (v) is very high in his encomiums on the great
wisdom
and
care
of the
parliament ,
in
thus
keeping
judges
within
the proper bounds and limits of this act, by
not suffering them to run out (upon their
own
opinions )
into constructive
treasons , though in cases
that
seem to
them to have a like parity of reason , but
reserving
them
to the decision of parliament .
This is a great security to
the public , the judges , and
even
this
sacred act itself ;
and leaves a weighty
memento
to judges to be careful and
not over hasty in letting in treasons by construction
or
interpretation
, especially in new
cases
that have not been
resolved and settled .

He
observes , that as the autho
ritative decision of these

OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE SOVEREIGN .
New trea-
sons de.
the statute.
a new declarative
act ; and therefore the opinion of any
one or of both houses , though of very respectable weight ,
is not that solemn declaration
referred to by this act, as
the only criterion
for judging of future treasons .
In
consequence of this
power , not
indeed
originally
clared since granted
by the statute of Edw . III. , but constitutionally
inherent
in
every subsequent
parliament
(which
cannot
be abridged of any rights by the act of a precedent one) ,
the legislature
was
extremely
liberal
in
declaring
new
treasons in the unfortunate reign of king Richard II.;
as ,
particularly , by the
statute
21 Ric. 2 , c. 3 , which made.
the
bare purpose and intent of killing
or deposing
the
king , without
any overt act to demonstrate it, high trea-
son .
And yet so little
effect have over-violent laws to
prevent any crime , that within two years afterwards
this
very prince was both deposed
and murdered .
And in the
first year of his
successor's reign , an act was passed (x) ,
reciting , " that
no
man
knew how he ought
to
behave
himself , to do , speak,
or say, for doubt of such pains of
treason ; and therefore it was accorded
, that in no time to
come any treason be judged
otherwise than was ordained
by the statute of king Edward III."
This at once
swept
away the whole
load of extravagant
treasons introduced
in the time of Richard II.
But afterwards , between the reign
of Henry IV. and
Queen
Mary,
and
particularly in the
bloody
reign
of
Henry VIII . , the spirit of
inventing
new
and
strange
treasons was
revived ; among which we may reckon
the
offences
of breaking
prison
or rescue , when the
prisoner
was committed
for
treason ; uttering
execrations against
the king ;
calling
him
opprobrious
names by
public
writing ; counterfeiting
the sign
manual
or
signet ;
re-
fusing to abjure the pope
; marrying , without
the
royal
licence , any of the king's children , sisters, aunts , nephews
,
or nieces ; bare solicitation
of the chastity of the queen

has

in creating
new
offences of this kind , yet the number
has been somewhat
increased , as we shall find upon a short review (y) .

once
before made high treason by
statute

the life of that princess .
And after
her
decease it continued
a high misdemeanor ,
punishable with forfeiture of goods and chattels , even in
the most flourishing
era of indefeasible
hereditary right
and jure divino

.
But it was again raised into
high treason, by the statute of Anne
before mentioned ,
at the time of a projected invasion in favour of the then
pretender ; and upon this statute one Matthews , a printer,
was convicted
and
executed
in 1719 , for printing a trea

express , utter , or

any printing or writing , or by any
overt act or deed , being legally
convicted thereof upon the
oaths of two lawful

OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
SOVEREIGN .
Misprisions
(a
term
derived
from the old
French ,
mespris, a neglect
or contempt ) are , in the acceptation of
our law , generally understood to be all such high offences
as are under
the
degree of capital , but nearly bordering
thereon
and it is said, that a misprision
is contained in
every treason
and felony
whatsoever
and that , if the
sovereign so please , the offender may be proceeded
against
for the misprision
only (f).
Upon this
principle, in
deed , while the jurisdiction of the Star Chamber subsisted ,
it was held that the king might remit a prosecution for
treason , and cause the delinquent
to be censured
in that
court , merely for a high misdemeanor : as happened in
the
case of Roger
earl of Rutland , in 43 Eliz . who was
concerned in the earl of Essex's
rebellion (g) .
Mispri
sions
are
generally
divided
into
two
sorts :
negative ,
which
consist
in the
concealment of something
which
ought to be revealed ; and positive , which
consist in the
commission of something which ought not to be done.
Of the first, or negative kind , is misprision
of treason ;
consisting
in the bare
knowledge
and
concealment of
treason , without
any degree of assent
thereto : for any
assent makes the party a principal
traitor ;
as indeed the
concealment , which
was construed aiding and abetting ,
did at the common law : in like manner
as the knowledge
of a plot against
the state, and not revealing it , was a
capital crime at Florence , and in other states of Italy (h).
But it was
enacted
by the
statute
1 & 2 Ph . & M.
c . 10 ,
8. 8 (i) , that
a bare concealment of treason should
be
only held
a misprision .
This concealment
becomes cri
minal , if the
party apprised of the
treason
does
not ,
as
soon as conveniently
may be , reveal it to some judge of
assize or justice
of the
peace
(4) .
But if there be any
probable
circumstances
of assent,
as if one goes to a

that

being in
such company
once by accident , and having
heard such
treasonable
conspiracy , meets the same company
again ,
and hears more of it , but conceals
it ; this is an implied
assent in law , and makes the concealer guilty of actual
high treason (1).
The punishment
of misprision
of trea
son is loss of the profits of lands during life , forfeiture of
goods , and
imprisonment
during life (m).
Which total
forfeiture of the goods was originally inflicted while
the
offence
amounted
to
principal
treason ,
and of
course
included in it a felony , by the common law ; and there
fore is no exception to the general rule laid down in a
former chapter (n) , that wherever an offence is punished
by such total forfeiture , it is felony at the common law.

Contempts
against the sove

the interests of a foreign
potentate
to those of our own , or doing or receiving any
thing that
may
create
an undue
influence in favour of
such
extrinsic
power :
as , by taking a pension from any
foreign prince without
the consent of the crown ( t) .
Or ,
by disobeying
the lawful commands
of the
sovereign ;
whether by writs issuing
out of his
courts of justice , or
by a summons
to attend his privy
council , or by letters
from
the
sovereign
to a subject
commanding
him to
return from beyond seas , or by his writ of ne exeat regno ,
or
proclamation ,
commanding
the
subject
to
stay at

Disobedience
to any of these commands is a
high
misprision

is dis
obedience

OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
SOVEREIGN .
A. B." cause A. B. to be forewarned that he appear before
us to answer the contempt wherewith he stands charged :
which
contempt is particularly
recited in the
preamble
to the writ (a).
This form
of criminal
procedure
took
its origin from the exorbitant power claimed and exercised
in England by the
pope , which
even in the days of blind
zeal was too heavy for our ancestors to bear.
It may justly
be
observed
, that religious
principles ,
which (when genuine and pure) have an evident tendency
to make their professors better
citizens
as well as better
men, have (when perverted and
erroneous )
been
usually
subversive of civil government , and been made both the
cloak and the instrument
of every pernicious
design
that
can be harboured in the heart of man.
The
unbounded
authority
that
was
exercised
by the Druids
in the west ,
under the influence of pagan superstition , and the terrible
ravages
committed by the
Saracens in the east , to pro-
pagate the religion of Mahomet , both witness to the truth
of that ancient universal observation , that in all ages and
in all countries , civil and ecclesiastical tyranny have been
mutually
productive of each
other .
The church of Eng-
land has , however , habitually
inculcated
due obedience to
lawful authority , and has been (as her prelates on a trying
occasion
once
expressed
it (b) )
in
her
principles
and
practice
ever most unquestionably
loyal .
The
clergy of
her persuasion entertain in general just notions of the ties
of society
and
the rights of civil government .
As in
matters of faith and morality they acknowledge no guide
but
the
Scriptures , so , in matters of external
polity and
of private right , they derive all their
title from the civil
magistrate
; the great body of our clergy look up to the
sovereign
as their
head , to the parliament
as their law-
giver , and pride themselves in nothing
more justly , than
in being true members of the church , emphatically
by law
established .
But
notions
of ecclesiastical
liberty , when
carried to an extreme , have ere now
been
destructive of

those
ties and obligations
by which
society
is kept toge
ther ; encroaching
on those
rights , which reason and the
original
contract of every free state in the universe have
vested in the sovereign
power ; and aiming at a distinct
independent supremacy of their own , where spiritual
men
and spiritual
causes
are
concerned.
The
effects of reli
gious
bigotry,
when
actuated
by erroneous
principles ,
even of the protestant kind , have been made evident by
the history of the anabaptists in Germany , of the cove
nanters in Scotland , and of those
sectaries in England,
who, in the
17th
century ,
overturned
the
church
and
monarchy , shook every pillar of law and private property ,
and aimed at establishing in their stead a kingdom
of the
saints .
These devastations , though
violent
and tumul
tuous , were but of short duration .
Whereas the progress
of the papal policy , long actuated by the steady counsels
of successive pontiffs , took deeper
root, and was at length
in some places with difficulty , in others
has never yet ,
been extirpated .
For this we might call to witness the
intrigues of the Jesuits ,
once
triumphant
over Christen
dom , but now abandoned by even Roman catholic powers :
our present subject , however, rather leads us to consider
the vast strides which were formerly made in this kingdom
by the popish clergy
; how nearly they arrived to effecting
their
grand
design ; some few of the means they made
use of for establishing
their plan ; and how almost all of
them were defeated
or converted to better purposes , by
the vigour
of our free
constitution , and the wisdom
of
successive
parliaments .
progressof
usurpation.
The ancient British church , by whomsoever planted , was Origin and
a stranger to the bishop of Rome , and all his pretended
the
papal
authority
.
But the pagan Saxon invaders
,
having driven
the
professors
of
christianity
to
the remotest corners
of
our island
,
their
own conversion was afterwards
effected
.
by Augustin the monk
,
and other missionaries from the
court of Rome
.
This naturally
introduced
some
few of
the papal corruptions
in
points
of
faith and doctrine
:
but


104
OFFENCES

THE
SOVEREIGN .
we read of no civil authority claimed by the pope in these
kingdoms , till the era of the Norman
conquest ; when the
then reigning
pontiff having
favoured
Duke William in
his
projected
invasion , by blessing
his host and conse-
crating
his
banners , took that
opportunity
also of esta-
blishing
his
spiritual
encroachments ;
and
was
even
permitted
so to
do by the
policy
of the
conqueror , in
order more
effectually
to humble
the Saxon clergy
and
aggrandise
his
Norman
prelates ;
prelates , who ,
being
bred abroad in the doctrine and practice of slavery , had
contracted a reverence and regard for it, and took a plea-
sure in riveting the chains of a free-born people.
The most stable system
of rational
government
makes
provision
for a due subordination
of rank , and a gradual
scale of authority
; and tyranny itself is most surely sup-
ported by a regular increase of despotism , rising from the
slave to the sultan ; with this difference, however , that
the measure of obedience
in the
one is grounded on the
principles
of society ,
and is extended
no
farther
than
reason
and
necessity will
warrant ;
in
the
other it is
limited only by absolute will
and pleasure , without
per-
mitting the inferior
to examine the title upon which it is
founded .
More
effectually therefore to enslave the con-
sciences
and
minds
of the people , the
Romish
clergy
themselves paid the most implicit
obedience
to their own
superiors
or prelates ; and they , in their
turns , were as
blindly devoted to the will of the sovereign pontiff , whose
decisions they held to be infallible, and whose authority
they deemed to be co-extensive with the christian
world .
Hence
his
legates a latere were introduced
into
every
kingdom
of Europe , his bulls and decretal epistles became
the rule both of faith
and discipline , his judgment was
the final
resort in all
cases
of
doubt
or difficulty , his
decrees
were enforced by anathemas
and
spiritual
cen-
sures, he dethroned
even kings
who were refractory , and
denied to whole kingdoms (when undutiful ) the exercise of
christian ordinances , and the benefits of the gospel of God .

But, though the being spiritual
head of the church was
a thing of great sound, and of greater
authority , among
men of conscience and piety , yet the court of Rome was
fully apprised that (among the bulk of mankind ) power
cannot be maintained without property ; and therefore its
attention
began
very
early to
be
riveted
upon
every
method that promised pecuniary advantage .
The doctrine
of purgatory
was introduced , and with it the purchase of
masses
to redeem the souls of the deceased .
New-fangled
offences
were
created, and indulgences
were sold to the
wealthy ,
for
liberty
to sin without
danger .
The
canon
law took cognisance of crimes , enjoined penance pro salute
anima , and
commuted
that
penance for money.. Non-
residence and pluralities
among the clergy , and marriages
among the laity related within the seventh degree , were
strictly
prohibited
by
canon ;
but
dispensations
were
seldom
denied
to those who
could
afford
to buy them .
In short , all the wealth of Christendom
was sought
to be
drained
and
directed by a thousand
channels , into the
coffers of the holy see.
The establishment
also of the feudal system in most of
the
governments
of
Europe , whereby the lands
of all
private
proprietors
were
declared
to
be holden
of the
prince , gave a hint to the
court of Rome for usurping
a
similar authority
over all the preferments of the church ;
which began first in Italy , and gradually
spread
itself to
England.
The pope became
a feudal lord ; and all ordi-
nary patrons were to hold their rights of patronage under
this
universal
superior .
Estates
held by feudal tenure ,
being
originally gratuitous
donations , were at that time
denominated
beneficia ; their very name as well as consti-
tution was borrowed , and the care of the souls of a parish
thence came to be denominated
a benefice .
Lay fees were
conferred by investiture
or delivery of corporal possession ;
and
spiritual
benefices
,
which
at first were universally
donative , now received in like
manner a spiritual
inves-
titure, by institution
from the bishop , and induction
under

his authority .
As lands escheated
to the lord , in defect of
a legal tenant ,
so
benefices
lapsed to the bishop
upon
non-presentation by the patron , in the nature of a spiritual
escheat .
The
annual
tenths
collected
from
the
clergy
were equivalent
to the
feudal
render , or rent
reserved
upon a grant ; the oath of canonical obedience
was copied
from the oath of fealty required
from
the vassal by his
superior ; and the primer seisins of our military
tenures ,
whereby the first profits of an heir's
estate were cruelly
extorted by his lord , gave birth to as cruel an exaction of
first -fruits from the beneficed
clergy .
And the occasional
aids and tallages , levied by the
prince
on his
vassals ,
gave a handle to the pope to levy , by the means of his
legates a latere , peter-pence and other taxations .
At
length
the holy father
went
a step beyond
any
example of either emperor or feudal lord .
He reserved to
himself, by his own apostolical
authority
(c) , the presen-
tation
to all
benefices
which
became
vacant
while
the
incumbent
was attending
the
court of
Rome
upon
any
occasion, or on his journey
thither , or back again ; and
moreover such also as became
vacant by his promotion to
a bishopric
or abbey : " etiamsi
ad illa persona
consueve-
rint
et debuerint
per
electionem aut quemvis
alium modum
assumi."
And this
last , the
canonists
declared , was no
detriment at all to the patron , being only like the change
of a life in a feudal
estate by the lord .
Dispensations
to
avoid these vacancies
begat the doctrine of commendams :
and
papal
provisions
were the
previous
nomination
to
such
benefices , by a kind of anticipation , before
they
became actually void : though afterwards indiscriminately
applied to any right of patronage exerted
or usurped by
the pope.

by Italian
and other
foreign

and constitution
of
England .

very nomination
to bishoprics , that

cient

of the crown , was wrested

Henry I., and afterwards
from
his
successor
king John ;
and seemingly indeed conferred on the chapters belonging
to
each
see ; but by means of the frequent
appeals to
Rome, through
the intricacy of the laws which regulated
canonical
elections , was eventually
vested
in the
pope .
And to sum up this
head with a transaction
most unpa
ralleled and astonishing
in its kind , pope Innocent III .
had at length the effrontery to demand , and king John had
the meanness
to consent to , a resignation
of his crown to
the pope, whereby England was to become for
ever
St.
Peter's patrimony
; and the dastardly monarch re-accepted
his sceptre
from the hands of the papal legate , to hold as
the vassal of the holy see , at the annual rent of a thousand
marks.
Another engine
set on foot ,
or at least
greatly im
proved , by the court of Rome , was a masterpiece of papal
policy.
Not content with the ample provision of tithes ,
which the law of the land
had given to the
parochial
clergy , they endeavoured to grasp at the lands and inhe
ritances
of the
kingdom ,
and
(had not the legislature
withstood
them ) might by this time have been masters of
every foot of ground
in the kingdom .
To this end they
introduced the monks of the Benedictine
and other rules ,
men of austere religion , separated
from the world and its
concerns by a vow of perpetual
celibacy , yet fascinating
the minds
of the people by pretences
to
extraordinary
sanctity , while all their aim was to aggrandise the power
and extend the influence of their grand superior the pope.
And as , in those times of civil tumult , great rapines and
violence
were daily
committed
by overgrown lords
and
their adherents , they were taught to believe , that founding
a monastery a little before their deaths would atone for a
life of incontinence , disorder , and bloodshed .
Hence in
numerable
abbeys
and religious
houses
were built within
a century after the conquest , and endowed
, not only with
the tithes of parishes which were ravished from the secular
clergy , but also with lands , manors , lordships , and exten

sive baronies .
And
the
doctrine
inculcated
was ,
that
whatever
was so given
to , or purchased by, the
monks
and friars , was consecrated to God himself : and that to
alienate it or take it away was no
less
than
the sin of
sacrilege .
I might here have enlarged
upon other contrivances ,
which will occur to the recollection of the reader, set on
foot by the court of Rome , for effecting an entire exemp-
tion of its clergy from
any intercourse with the civil ma-
gistrate
such as the separation of the ecclesiastical court
from the temporal ; the
appointment
of
its
judges
by
merely spiritual
authority
,
without
any interposition
from
the crown
;
the exclusive jurisdiction
it
claimed over all
ecclesiastical persons and causes
;
and the privilegium cle-
ricale
,
or
benefit
of
clergy
,
which delivered
all
clerks from
any trial
or
punishment
except before their
own tribunal
.
But the history and progress
of
ecclesiastical courts
(d),
as
well
as
of
purchases
in
mortmain
(e),
have
already
been
discussed
and
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
adverting
to
the nature
of
the privilegium
clericale
in
the
progress of the
present
book
.
Therefore
I
need
only
observe
at
present
,
that notwithstanding
this plan
of
pon-
tifical
power
was
so
deeply
laid
,
and
so
indefatigably
pursued by the unwearied
politics
of
the court
of
Rome
through
a
long
succession
of
ages
;
notwithstanding
it
was polished and improved by the united endeavours
of
a
body of men
,
who
engrossed
all the learning
of
Europe
for centuries together
;
notwithstanding
it
was firmly and
resolutely
executed by persons
the
best
calculated
for
establishing
tyranny and despotism
,
being
fired with
a
bigoted enthusiasm
(
which prevailed
not only among the
weak
and
simple
,
but
even
among
those
of
the best
natural
and
acquired
endowments
),
unconnected
with
their fellow

subjects
,
and
totally indifferent
what
might
befal that posterity
to
which they bore no endearing

King Edward
I. , a wise and magna-
Edward I.
nimous
prince , set himself in earnest to shake off this
servile yoke .
He would not suffer his bishops
to attend
a general
council , till they had sworn not to
receive
the
papal benediction .
He made light of all papal
bulls
and
processes : attacking
Scotland
in defiance of
one :
and
seizing
the temporalities
of his
clergy , who under pre
tence of another refused to pay a tax imposed by parlia
ment .
He strengthened the statutes of mortmain
; thereby
closing
the great gulf, in which
all the
lands
of the
kingdom were in danger of being swallowed .
And , one
of his
subjects
having
obtained
a bull of excommuni
cation
against another , he ordered him to be
executed
as a traitor , according to the
ancient law (f).
Also , in
the
thirty -fifth
year
of his reign was
made
the
first
statute
against papal provisions , being , according to sir
Edward
Coke (g) , the foundation
of all the
subsequent
statutes of præmunire , which
was ranked
as an
offence
immediately
against the king , because
every

of the authority
of the crown .

charged against
that unhappy
prince , that he had given

allowance to the bulls of the

.
But Edward
III
.
was
of
a
temper extremely different
:
and
to
remedy
these inconveniences first by gentle
means
,
he
and his
nobility
wrote
an
expostulation
to
the
pope
;
but re
ceiving
a
menacing
and
contemptuous
answer
,
withal
acquainting
him
,
that
the emperor
(
who
a
few years be

,
had established
a
law against provisions

and also the king
of
France
had lately
submitted
to

;
the king replied
,
that

the
pope's part
,
he was
ready
to
give
battle
to
them
both
,
in defence
of the liberties
of
the crown
.
Hereupon
more sharp
and
penal
laws
were
devised
against pro

which
enacted
that the court
of
Rome should
not present

collate
to
any bishopric

and that whoever might
disturb
any patron
in

presentation
to

of
a
papal
provision
,
such provisor
should
pay fine and ransom
to
the
king

as

In the reign of Richard II. , it was found
necessary to Richard II.
sharpen
and strengthen these laws , and therefore it was
enacted by statutes
3 Ric .
2 , c. 3, and
7 Ric. 2 , c. 12 ,
first, that no alien should be capable of letting
his
bene-
fice to farm ; in order
to compel such as had crept in , at
least to reside on their
preferments :
and ,
afterwards ,
that
no alien should
be capable to be presented to any
ecclesiastical
preferment , under the penalty of the statutes
of provisors .
By the statute 12 Ric. 2 , c . 15 , all liege-
men
of the king , accepting of a living by any foreign
provision , were put out of the king's protection , and the
benefice was made void .
To which the statute 13 Ric. 2 ,
st. 2 , cc. 2 and 3 , added still further
penalties .
In the writ for the execution of these statutes the words
præmunire
facias, being
(as we said) used to command a
citation of the party , have denominated in common speech
not only the writ, but the
offence
itself of maintaining
the
papal
power , by the
name of pramunire.
And
accordingly the next
statute I shall
mention
is usually
called the statute ofpræmunire .
It is the 16 Ric. 2 , c. 5,
which
enacts, that whoever
procures at Rome , or else-
where ,
any
translations ,
processes ,
excommunications ,
bulls , instruments , or other things , which touch the king ,
against him, his crown , and realm , and all persons aiding
and assisting
therein , shall be put out of the king's pro-
tection , their lands and goods forfeited
to the king's use ,
and they shall
be attached by their
bodies to answer to
the king and his council : or process
of præmunire facias
shall be made out against them as in other
cases of pro-
visors .
By the statute 2 Hen. 4, c. 3, all persons who
accept Henry IV.
any provision from the pope, to be exempt from canonical
obedience to their
proper
ordinary , are also subjected
to
the penalties of præmunire .
And
this
is the last of our
ancient statutes touching this offence
; the usurped civil
power of the bishop of Rome
being
pretty well broken
down by these statutes , as his usurped
religious
power

AGAINST
THE
SOVEREIGN .
was in
about
a century
afterwards ;
the spirit of
the
nation
being
so
much
raised
against
foreigners ,
that
about
this
time , in the reign of Henry V. , the
alien
priories , or abbeys
for foreign
monks , were suppressed ,
and their lands
given to the
crown .
And
no
further
attempts were afterwards made in support of these foreign
jurisdictions.
A
learned
writer,
below
referred
to, is
therefore
greatly mistaken , when he says (1), that in Henry VI's
time the archbishop of Canterbury
(m) and other bishops
offered to the king a large
supply , if he would
consent
that all laws against
provisors , and
especially the statute
16 Ric. 2 , might
be repealed ; but
that this motion
was
rejected.
This account
is
incorrect
in all its branches .
For , first , the application , which he probably
means , was
made,
not by the
bishops
only , but by the unanimous
consent of a provincial
synod , assembled in 1439 , 18 Hen .
VI., that very synod which
at the same time refused to
confirm
and
allow a papal
bull , which
then
was
laid
before them .
Next , the purport of it was not to procure
a repeal of the
statutes
against
provisors , or that of
Richard II. in particular
; but to request that the penal-
ties thereof , which
by a forced construction were applied
to all who sued in the spiritual , and
even in many tem-
poral , courts of this realm , might be turned
against
the
proper
objects only ; those who appealed to Rome , or to
any foreign jurisdiction : the tenor of the petition
being ,
" that those penalties
should be taken to extend only to
those that commenced any suits
or procured any writs or
public instruments
at Rome or elsewhere
out of England ;
and that no one
should be prosecuted
upon that
statute
for any suit in the spiritual
courts
or lay jurisdictions of
this kingdom ."
Lastly , the motion was so far from being
rejected , that the king promised
to recommend it to the
next parliament , and in the meantime that no one should
be molested upon this
account.
And the clergy were so

satisfied with their
success , that
they granted to the king
a whole tenth upon this occasion ( n ) .
And indeed
so far was the archbishop , who presided in
this synod , from countenancing
the usurped power of the
pope in this realm , that he was ever a firm opposer of it.
And , particularly
in
the
reign
of
Henry
V. , he
pre-
vented the king's uncle from being then made a cardinal ,
and legate a latere from the
pope
; upon the mere prin-
ciple of its being within the mischief
of papal provisions ,
and derogatory from the liberties of the English
church
and
nation .
For ,
as he
expressed
himself to the king
in his letter upon that subject, " he was bound to
oppose
it by his ligeance , and also to quit himself to God
and
the church of this
land , of which God and the king had
made
him
governor ."
This was not the language of a
prelate addicted to the slavery of the
see of Rome ; but
of one who was indeed of principles
so very opposite to
the
papal
usurpations ,
that
in the year preceding this
synod , 17 Hen. VI. , he refused
to consecrate a bishop of
Ely , who was nominated by Pope
Eugenius IV.
A con-
duct quite
consonant to his former behaviour , in 6 Hen .
VI. , when he refused to obey the commands of Pope Martin
V. , who
had
required
him to exert
his
endeavours to
repeal
the
statute of præmunire (" execrabile
illud sta-
tutum," as the holy father
phrases it) ; which
refusal
so
far exasperated the court of Rome
against
him , that at
length the pope
issued
a bull to suspend him from his
office
and
authority , which
the archbishop
disregarded ,
and
appealed to
a general
council .
And
so sensible
was
the
nation
of
the
primate's
merit ,
that
the

spiritual and temporal , and also the university of
Oxford ,
wrote
letters
to the
pope in his
defence ; and
the house of commons

the king , to

an
ambassador forthwith

holiness , on behalf
of the

pope
for
opposing
the excessive power of the
court of
Rome (o).
This then is the original
meaning of the offence , which
we call præmunire ;
viz. ,
introducing
a foreign
power
into this land , and creating
imperium in imperio , by pay
ing that obedience to papal process , which constitutionally
belonged to the crown alone , long before the reformation
in the reign of Henry VIII.: at which time the penalties
of præmunire were indeed extended to more papal abuses
than
before ;
as the kingdom
then entirely renounced the
authority of the see of Rome , though not all the corrupted
doctrines of the Roman
church .
And therefore by the
statutes 24 Hen. 8 , c.
12 , and 25 Hen. 8 , cc . 19 & 21 , to
appeal to
Rome
from any of the king's
courts , which
(though illegal before) had at times been connived at ; to
sue to Rome for any licence
or dispensation ; or to obey
any
process
from
thence ;
was
prohibited
under
the
penalties of præmunire .
And , in order to restore to the
king in effect the nomination
of vacant bishoprics , and
yet
keep
up the
established
forms , it was enacted by
statute 25 Hen.
8 , c. 20, that if the dean
and
chapter
refused to
elect the person
named by the king , or any
archbishop
or bishop
to confirm
or consecrate him , they
should fall within the penalties of the statutes of præmu
nire .
Thus far the penalties
of præmunire
seem to have kept
within the proper
bounds of their
original
institution
,
the depressing the power of the pope :
but, they
being
pains of
no
inconsiderable
consequence
, it
has
been
thought fit to apply the same to other heinous
offences ;
some of which
bear more , and
some
less, relation
to this
original
offence .
For instance , to assert , maliciously
and
advisedly , by speaking or writing , that both or either of the
houses
of parliament
have a legislative
authority without
the king ,
is
declared a præmunire

But still
such

the law, that it will not guard his civil rights , nor remedy

may suffer.
And
no man , knowing
him to be guilty, can safely give him
comfort , aid , or relief (x).
But although the severe penal
ties of a pramunire have been
denounced by many sta

some are still unrepealed , prosecutions for
this offence
have been almost unheard of in our courts (y),

CHAPTER VIII.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
GOVERNMENT .
Or offences falling within the scope of this chapter :-
I.
The first and principal
is the
mal -administration of
such high
officers , as are in public trust
and employment
.
This is usually punished by the method of parliamentary
impeachment : wherein such penalties , short of death , are
inflicted , as to the wisdom of the house of peers shall seem
proper ; consisting
usually of imprisonment , fines , or per-
petual disability .
II. Hither
also
may be referred
the
offence
of
em-
bezzling
the
public
money , called
among
the
Romans
peculatus , which the Julian law punished with death in a
magistrate , and with
deportation ,
or banishment ,
in
a
private
person (a).
This
is
an
offence
punishable
by
indictment
at common law, in virtue
of two
principles
which
have
been
thus
enunciated (b) .
1st. If
a
man
accepts
an
office
of trust
and
confidence
concerning
the
public ,
especially
when it is attended with
profit ,
he is answerable
to the
crown
for his
execution of such
office ; and , 2ndly, Where there
is
a breach of
trust, a
fraud , or an imposition in a subject concerning the public ,
which,
as
between subject
and
subject , would
only be
actionable , yet as that concerns the crown and the public ,
it is indictable .

a
breach of allegiance , by
infringing
the
royal
prerogative , and
assuming
one of the
attributes
of the
sovereign ,
that ,
viz . ,
of regulating
the
coinage
and
besides ,
as
all
money
which
bears
the
stamp
of the
kingdom
is
sent into the world upon
the public
faith ,
as containing
metal of a particular
weight
and standard ,
whoever falsifies this
is an offender against the state, by
contributing to render
that public
faith
suspected .
And
for the same
reasons , by a law of the Emperor
Constan
tine (n) , false coiners were declared guilty of high treason ,
and were condemned to be burnt alive : as by the laws of
Athens (0) all
counterfeiters , debasers , and
diminishers
of the current coin were subjected to capital punishment .
However , it must be owned, that this method of reasoning
was a little
overstrained : counterfeiting
or debasing the
coin being usually practised , rather for the sake of private
and
unlawful
lucre , than
out of any disaffection to the
sovereign .
And
therefore
both
this
and
its
kindred
species of treason , that of counterfeiting
the seals of the
crown or other royal signatures , seem
better denominated
by the
later
civilians
a branch of the

For
this
confounds
the distinction

of offences
: and , by affixing
the

of guilt upon the man who coins a groat

CHAPTER IX .
OFFENCES
AGAINST
PUBLIC
JUSTICE .
THE order of our distribution
will next lead us to take
into consideration
such criminal acts
as more especially
affect the commonwealth , or public polity of the kingdom :
these , however ,
as well as offences
which are peculiarly
pointed against the lives and security of private
subjects ,
are
also
offences
against
the
sovereign
as
the pater
familias
of the nation
to
whom it appertains
by his
regal office to protect the community , and each individual
thereof , from every degree
of injurious
violence , by execu
ting those laws , which the people themselves in conjunction
with him have enacted ;
or at least have consented
to ,
by an agreement either
expressly made in the persons of
their representatives , or by a tacit
and implied
consent
presumed and proved by immemorial
usage.
The
class of crimes which we have now
before us , is
subdivided
into such a number of inferior
and subordinate
species, that it
would
much
exceed
the bounds
of an
elementary
treatise , and be insupportably
tedious
to the
reader , were I to examine them all minutely , or with any
degree of
critical
accuracy .
I
shall
therefore
confine
myself principally to general
definitions , or descriptions
of these various
offences , and to the punishment
inflicted
by law for each of them ; with now and then a few inci
dental observations
: referring
the student for more par
ticulars to other voluminous
authors ; who have treated of
these subjects with greater
precision
and more in detail ,
than is consistent with the plan of these Commentaries .

OFFENCES
AGAINST
PUBLIC JUSTICE .
Crimes
more
especially
affecting
the commonwealth
,
may be discussed under four
heads :-as
offences
against
public
justice ,
against
the
public
peace , against
public
trade , against the public
health
and safety, morals
and
economy
of each of which
we will take a cursory view
in the order indicated .
First , of
fences
First, then , of offences
against public justice : some of
againstpub which
are
felonious ; others only misdemeanors . I shall
lic justice.
begin with those that are most penal , and descend gradu
ally to such as are of less malignity.
Forgery (a) is a very heinous offence , sometimes directed
against public justice , of which several species
should here
be noticed .
Forging the
great seal,
&c.
I.
As to forging her majesty's
seals , it is enacted that ,
Privy seal,
Whosoever
shall
forge
or
counterfeit ,
or shall
utter ,
knowing the same to be forged
or
counterfeited ," the
great
seal of the
United Kingdom , her majesty's
privy
seal , any privy
signet of her majesty , or her majesty's
royal
sign
manual ,
or " shall
forge or
counterfeit
the
stamp or impression of any of the seals aforesaid , or shall
utter
any
document
or
instrument
whatsoever , having
thereon or affixed thereto the stamp or impression of any
such forged or counterfeited
seal , knowing
the same to be
the stamp or impression of such forged
or counterfeited
seal , or any forged
or counterfeited
stamp
or impression
made or
apparently
intended
to resemble the
stamp or
impression
of
any of the seals aforesaid,
knowing
the
same to be forged or counterfeited , or shall forge or alter
or utter
knowing
the same to be forged
or altered , any
document or instrument
having any of the said stamps or
impressions thereon or affixed thereto ," shall be guilty of
felony (b).

And it has been held , that
the party opposing such
arrest becomes thereby particeps
criminis ; that is , an
accessory
in felony , and
a principal
in high treason (m).
Formerly,
one of the greatest ob
structions
to public justice , both of the civil and criminal
kind , was the multitude
of pretended privileged
places ,
where
indigent
persons
assembled
together
to
shelter
themselves from justice
(especially in London and South
wark), under
the pretext
of their
having
been
ancient
palaces of the crown , or the like : all of which sanctuaries
for iniquity were
demolished , and the
opposing of any

OFFENCES
AGAINST
PUBLIC
JUSTICE.
1V. Escare
Besides the
foregoing
statutory
offences ,
the
wilful
refusal to aid a peace -officer in the execution of his duty ,
in order to preserve the
peace , is an indictable
misde
meanor at common law (p).
IV. An escape of a person arrested upon criminal pro
cess , is also an
offence
against
public
justice , for which
the
party
escaping
is
punishable
by fine
or imprison
ment (q).
But the officer permitting
such escape , either
by negligence
or connivance , is more culpable
than
the
prisoner
the
natural
desire of liberty
pleading
strongly
in his
behalf , though
he ought in strictness
of law to
submit himself quietly
to custody , till
cleared by the due
course of justice .
Officers therefore
who , after
arrest ,
negligently
permit
a felon
to
escape ,
are
punishable by
fine (r) : but a voluntary
escape , by consent
and
con
nivance of the officer , is a more serious
offence
: and for
it, before the conviction of the principal
party , the officer
thus neglecting his duty may be fined and imprisoned (s) .
Moreover , it is
generally
agreed that
such an escape

A rescue, there

But here likewise , as upon voluntary

Having reference to the
offence

By statute 16 Geo . 2 , c. 31 , s . 2 , to convey to any prisoner
in custody
for treason or felony
any arms ,

Of
a
nature
somewhat
similar to
the

is that of theft -bote , which
is where the party

the
felon , but
also
takes
his

agreement
not to

This
is
frequently
called

and
formerly
was
held
to
make
a man

accessory
, but is now punished
only
with fine and im-

The

of this

for

as an
attorney , solicitor , or agent , in any suit : the court , upon
complaint, shall
examine it in a summary way ; and , if
proved , the offender is punishable
as below mentioned (s) .
Hereunto
may also be referred
another offence , of equal
malignity
and
audaciousness ; that of suing
another in
the name of a fictitious plaintiff ; either one not in being

This offence ,
if committed

a practice
that was greatly
en
couraged by the first introduction

This is an
offence
against public justice , as it keeps alive

At once therefore to discourage

by statute

under
pretence of any penal law, makes any composition.
without leave of the court , or takes any money or promise
from the defendant
to
excuse
him (which
demonstrates
his intent in commencing the prosecution to be merely to
serve his own ends , and not for the public good ) , he shall
inter alia forfeit

on any popular or penal statute (ƒ).
The above enactment does not apply to offences
cogni
zable
only before magistrates (g) , but the taking
of the
amount of penalty imposed is an offence within its provi

CHAPTER X.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE PUBLIC PEACE .
WE
are
next
to consider
offences
against the public
peace ; the conservation of which is intrusted to the sove-
reign
and
the
executive ,
in the
manner
and for the
reasons
which
were formerly
mentioned (a).
An offence
falling within the limits of this chapter is either an actual
breach
of the peace , or constructively
so, by tending to
make
others
break
it.
It is
either
felonious ,
or
not
felonious .
The felonious breaches of the peace are strained
up to that degree of malignity by the statute law
and
particularly ,
:
I. The riotous
assembling of twelve
persons , or more , I. Riotous
and not dispersing
upon
proclamation .
This
was
first
made high treason by statute
3 & 4 Edw . 6,
c . 5 , when
the king was a minor , and a change in
religion
to be
effected
but that statute was repealed by statute
1 Mar.
c.
1 , among the other treasons created
since the 25 Edw .
3; though
the prohibition
was in substance
re-enacted ,
with an inferior
degree
of punishment , by statute
1 Mar,
st.
2 ,
c.
12 ,
which
made the
same
offence
a felony .
These
statutes
specified and particularized
the nature
of
the riots they were meant to suppress ; as , for example ,
such
as were set
on foot with intention
to offer violence
to the privy council , or to change the laws of the kingdom ,
or for certain
other specific purposes : in which cases , it

THE

PEACE .
the persons implicated
were commanded by proclamation
to disperse , and did not , it was by the statute of Mary
made felony , but within the benefit of clergy ; and also
the act indemnified
the peace officers and their assistants ,
if they killed any of the mob in endeavouring to suppress
such riot.
This was thought
a necessary
security in that
sanguinary
reign , when
popery was
intended
to be re-
established , which was likely to produce great discontents
:
but at first it was made only for a year , and was afterwards
continued for that queen's life .
And , by statute
1 Eliz . c.
16 , when a reformation
in religion was to be
once
more
attempted , it was revived
and continued
during her life
also ; and then expired .
From the accession of James I.
to the death of queen
Anne , it was never
once thought
expedient to revive it : but , in the first year of George I. ,
it was judged
necessary
, in order to support the execution
of the act of settlement , to renew it, and at one
stroke to
make it perpetual , with large
additions .
For , whereas
the
former
acts
expressly
defined
and
specified
what
should be accounted a riot, the statute
1 Geo. 1 , st. 2 , c. 5,
enacts, generally (s. 1) , that if any twelve persons are un-
lawfully assembled to the disturbance of the
peace , and
any one justice of the peace , sheriff , under-sheriff , or mayor
of a town , shall think proper to command them
by pro-
clamation to disperse, if they contemn his orders and con-
tinue
together
for
one
hour
afterwards ,
such
contempt
shall be felony .
And , further , if the reading of the pro-
clamation
be by force opposed
, or the reader be
in
any
manner wilfully
hindered
from the reading of it,
such
opposers
and
hinderers
are
felons
without
benefit
of
clergy
and
all
persons
to
whom
such
proclamation
ought
to
have
been made,
and
knowing
of such hin-
drance , and not dispersing , are felons (6).
There is the like
(b) The
punishment
of death is
taken
away , by the

s. 1, from
these
offences ; they are
now subjected to penal servitude for
life , or for
any term
not less than
five
years ,
or
imprisonment
for
any
term
not
exceeding
three
years .

AFFRAYS.

fiable in endeavouring
to part
the combatants , whatever
consequence
may
ensue (2).
But
more
especially
the
constable , or
other similar
officer , however
denominated ,
is bound to keep the peace ; and to that
purpose
may
break open doors to suppress an affray , or apprehend the
affrayers
; and may either carry them
before a justice , or
imprison them
by his own
authority
for a
convenient
space till the heat is over ; and may then
perhaps
also
make them
find
sureties for the peace (a).
The punish
ment of a common
affray is by fine and imprisonment
:
the measure of which must
be regulated
by the circum
stances
of the
case : for ,
where
there
is any material
aggravation , the
punishment
proportionably
increases
.
As where
the
officers of justice
are disturbed
in the due
execution of their
office : or where a respect to the parti
cular locality
ought to restrain
and regulate
men's beha
viour, more than in common places ;
as in the king's court ,
and the like.
And upon the same account also all affrays
in a church
or churchyard
are
esteemed
very
heinous
offences ,
as being
indignities
to Him to
whose
service
those
places are
consecrated
.
Therefore
mere quarrel
some words , which are
neither
an affray nor an
offence
in any other
place , are penal here.
For it is enacted by
statute 5 & 6 Edw . 6 , c. 4,
s . 1, that if any person
shall ,
by words
only ,
quarrel , chide , or brawl , in
a church or
churchyard , the ordinary
shall suspend him, if a layman ,
ab ingressu
ecclesiæ ; and, if a clerk in orders, from the
ministration
of his
office during pleasure .
Also , by sec
tion 2 of the same statute , if any person in such church.
or
churchyard
proceeds to smite
or lay
violent
hands
upon
another , he shall
be
excommunicated
ipso facto .
This enactment , however , " so far as it relates to persons
not in holy orders ," has been
repealed
by the 23 & 24
Vict. c. 32, s . 5 (b).

170
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE
PUBLIC
PEACE .
Two persons may be guilty of an affray : but ,
V.
Riots , routs , and unlawful assemblies, must
have
three persons at least to constitute
them .
An unlawful
assembly is when
three
or more do assemble themselves
together to do an unlawful
act,
as
to pull down enclo
sures , to destroy a warren or the game therein ; and part
without
doing
it ,
or making any motion
towards it (c) .
A rout is where three or more meet to do an unlawful
act
upon a common quarrel , as forcibly
breaking
down fences
upon
a right claimed of common
or of way ; and make
some advances
towards it (d ) .
A riot is where three or
more do an unlawful
act of violence , either with or with
out a common
cause
or
quarrel (e) :
as if they
beat
a
man ; or hunt and kill
game in another's park, chase,
warren ,
or
liberty
; or do any
other
unlawful
act with
force and violence ; or even do a lawful act, as removing
a nuisance , in a violent ,
tumultuous ,
and unjustifiable
manner (ƒ) .
The
punishment
of unlawful
assemblies , if
to the number
of twelve , we have just now
seen ,
may
extend
to penal
servitude (g), but from the number
of
three to
eleven ,
is by fine
and
imprisonment
, with
or
without
hard
labour (h) .
The
same
is the case
in riots
and routs by the common law ( ).
And by the statute
13
Hen. 4 , c.
7, any two justices , together with the
sheriff
or under -sheriff of the county , may come with the posse
comitatus , if need be , and suppress any such riot , assembly ,
or rout, arrest the rioters , and record upon the spot the
nature and circumstances of the whole transaction ; which
record
alone
shall
be a sufficient
conviction
of the of
fenders .
Under this statute it has
been held

So that
our ancient law, previous

pretty well to have guarded
against
any violent
breach of
the public peace ; especially
as any riotous
assembly on a
public
or general
account ,
as to redress
grievances
or
pull down all enclosures , and also resisting the queen's
forces if sent to keep the peace , may amount to overt acts
of treason , by levying war against the sovereign .

of a forcible
entry
or
detainer ; which
is committed by
violently
taking
or keeping possession of lands and tene-
ments, with menaces , force, and arms , and without the
authority of law. This was formerly allowable to every per-
son disseised , or turned out of possession , unless his entry
was taken
away or barred by his own neglect , or in some
special
cases .
But this being
found
prejudicial
to the
public
peace , it was thought
necessary by several statutes
to restrain
persons from the use of such violent methods ,
even of doing themselves justice
; and much more if they
have no justice in their claim (n ) .
So that the entry now
allowed by law is a peaceable one ; that forbidden is such
as is carried
on and maintained
with force , with violence
and
unusual
weapons .
A forcible
entry and detainer is
indictable
at common law (o).
By the statute

there record the force upon his or their
own view , as in

upon

conviction
may
commit
the offender to gaol , till he makes fine and ransom to the
crown .
Moreover , the justice or justices
have power
to
summon
a jury to try the forcible entry or detainer com-
plained of : and if the same be found by that jury , then ,
besides the fine on the offender, the justices
shall
make
restitution
by the sheriff of the
possession, without

a libel
as if it were openly printed , for it equally tends
to
a breach of the
peace (x).
Moreover , the statute
6 & 7
Vict . c. 96 , s .
3 , enacts , that if any person shall publish
or threaten to publish a libel upon
any other person , or
shall , directly
or indirectly , threaten to print or publish ,
or propose to abstain from printing or publishing, or offer
to prevent the printing or publishing of, any matter
or
thing touching
any other person , with intent to extort
any money or security , or any valuable thing , from such
or any other person , or with intent
to induce
any person
to confer or procure for
any person any appointment
or
office of profit
or trust , the offender
on conviction
shall
be liable to imprisonment
, with or without
hard labour ,
for any term not exceeding three years.
It is expressly
provided that this
enactment
shall
not
affect
the
law
relating to the sending
or delivery of threatening
letters

:
At common law it was immaterial
with respect to the
essence
of a libel, whether the
matter
of it were
true
or false
the provocation , not
the falsity,
being crimi
nally punishable , by reason of its tendency to disturb the
public
peace .
But now , by s. 4 of the statute just cited ,
the falsehood of the libel is made an essential
element in
the guilt of the defendant : it being enacted
thereby , that
if any person
shall
maliciously
publish
any defamatory
libel , " knowing
the same to be false ," he shall
be liable ,
on conviction , to imprisonment
for any term not exceed
ing two years , and to pay such fine
as the court
shall
award .
The 6th section of the same statute further en
acts , that
on the trial of any indictment
or information
for a defamatory libel , the defendant having
pleaded such
plea
as is
thereinafter
mentioned , " the
truth
of
the
matters
charged may be inquired

to allege that it was for the public

whether his guilt

For
a
long time
,
and during
a
critical
period
in
our
history
,
the question who were the
proper judges
of
the
character
of
the
matter
charged
in
an
indictment
as
libellous
-
the
court
or
the
jury-was much
contested
,
and eminent judges
ruled
that the fact
of
writing
,
print-
ing
,
or
publishing
the alleged libel and the truth
of
the
innuendos
inserted
in
the indictment
,
were alone
to
be
submitted
to
the jury
,
-that with the guilt
or
innocence
of
the accused generally they had no concern
(a).
The
important
question
thus
agitated
was
settled
by Mr.

between the crown and the defendant , on
the plea of not guilty , "it be competent to the jury,
impannelled
to try the
same , to give
their verdict on the
whole matter in issue," proceeds to declare (b) and enact ,
" that on every
such trial, the jury sworn
may give a
general
verdict of guilty
or not guilty , upon
the whole
matter put in issue upon such indictment
or information
;
and shall not be required or directed by the court or judge
before whom
such
indictment
or
information
shall be
tried , to find the defendant
or defendants guilty , merely
on the
proof
of
the publication
by
such
defendant
or
defendants , of the paper charged to be a libel , and of the
sense
ascribed to the same in such indictment
or infor
mation ."
But it is provided , that the court shall direct
the jury according
to their discretion , as in other criminal
cases (c) ; that the jury shall have the
same liberty
as in
regard to other
offences
of finding
a special verdict , and
the
defendant
the
same right of moving
in
arrest of
judgment, which was
allowed him before the passing of
the statute .
Whether, however ,
a particular
publication
be
so far
noxious in its bearing
and tendencies , as to amount
in
the abstract
to a libel, is a pure question of law.
But if
the publication
in consideration of law be libellous , then
it is a question of fact
for the jury , whether
it was wil
fully and maliciously
published , subject , however , to the
ordinary presumption of law, that in the absence
of proof
(b) In R. v. Cobbett, 29 St. Tr. 1,
49, Lord
Ellenborough
, C. J. , thus
addressed
the jury in reference to
the
above
enactment :-" I never
doubted
that an English jury had
the right of judging in these cases,
not only of the fact of publication ,
but
also
of the
nature
and
con
struction
of
the

published .
The
Act
of

is merely
declaratory ; and , had it not passed,
I should
nevertheless
have

On the three following

to the contrary , a man
intends that which is the natural
consequence
of his act.
Proof of the public
sale
or ex
posal to
sale of a libellous
paper in the defendant's
shop
by his servant is at common law sufficient prima facie
evidence to convict
the master of the house or shop of a
publication .
In such a case publication
by the servant is
presumed to be with the
assent of the master , and
so to
have
been equivalent
to publication
by him (d) .
How
ever , in this particular
a material
change for the better
has been made by the stat . 6 & 7 Vict. c. 96, s. 7, which
provides , that whensoever , upon the trial of any indict
ment
or information
for the publication
of a libel , under
the plea of not guilty ,
evidence shall
have been given
which
shall
establish
a presumptive
case of publication
against
the defendant , by the act of any other person by
his authority , it shall
be competent
to such defendant to
prove that such publication
was made without
his au
thority,
consent , or knowledge , and did
not
arise from
want of due care or caution on his part .
The criminal
procedure for any libel inserted in a news
paper has been much facilitated
by express enactment .
The principal statute now operative upon this
subject is
the 6 & 7 Will . 4 , c. 76 (e) , which
in substance provides
that , where the libel complained of is contained in a news
paper , and the defendant is indicted for having printed and
published it, in order to prove the defendant to be printer ,
publisher , or proprietor of the newspaper , a certified copy
of the affidavit , filed at the stamp - office in pursuance of
sect. 6. (which
mentions
the names and places of abode
of the printer, publisher , and proprietors
of the paper ,
title of the paper , and the place where it is printed ) , will
be conclusive evidence against the persons who signed the
affidavit , and prima facie evidence against others therein.

as

was assimilated
to that which in other cases had obtained
.
Neither the jury nor the parties
consequently can require
from the court
any specific and direct
opinion upon

but the course has long been for the judge
first
to
give
a
legal
definition

it

say whether the facts necessary

The judge , as a matter of advice
to them in deciding
that
question , may indeed give his
own opinion
as to the nature of the publication , but
is
not bound to do so as a matter of law(k).
At common law the punishment
for libel is fine , and
the
finding
sureties
to keep the
peace () ;
and
now ,
as we have
seen , the publication
of a defamatory
libel ,
with
knowledge
of
its
falsehood , subjects
the
offender
to imprisonment
not
exceeding two years, and fine (m).
And the malicious
publication
of
any defamatory
libel
renders
the party
liable , on
conviction , to fine or im
prisonment , or both , the
imprisonment
not to
exceed
the term of one year (n).
In the
above
and the other cases
formerly
considered,
where
blasphemous , immoral , treasonable ,
schismatical ,
seditious , or scandalous libels are punished by the English
law, the liberty of the
press , properly understood , is by
no means infringed
or violated .
The liberty of the press
is essential to the nature of a free state ; but this consists
in laying no previous
restraints upon publications , not in
allowing freedom from
censure
for criminal
matter when
published .
Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay
what sentiments
he pleases
before the public :
to forbid
this , is to destroy the freedom of the press : but if he
publishes
what
is improper ,
mischievous , or illegal, he
must take the consequence
of his own temerity .

ject the press to the restrictive
power of a licenser , as
was

ber of printers , and of presses which
each should employ , and prohibited
new publications , unless previously
approved by proper
licensers .
On
the demolition
of this odious juris
diction in 1641, the long parliament
of Charles
I.
after
their rupture
with that prince , assumed the same
powers as the starchamber
had
ex
ercised with respect to the licensing
of books ; and in 1643, 1647, 1649,
and
1652 (Scobell , i. 44, 134 ; ii .
88, 230) issued their ordinances
for
that
purpose ,
founded
principally
on the starchamber
decree of 1637.
In
1662 was
passed the statute 13
&
14
Car .
2,
c. 33, which
(with
some few
alterations ) was
copied
from the parliamentary
ordinances .
This act expired
in
1679, but was
revived
by statute
1 Jac . 2, c. 17,
and
continued
till
1692. It was
then continued
for two years longer
by statute 4 Will . & M.
c. 24 ; but
though
frequent
attempts
were
made by the government
to revive
it, in the subsequent
part of that
reign
(Com . Journ . 11 Feb.
1694 ;
26
Nov.
1695 ;
22
Oct.
1696 ; 9
Feb.
1697 ; 31 Jan. 1698), yet the
parliament
resisted it so strongly ,
that it finally expired , and the press
became properly
free in 1694 ; and
has ever since so continued .

cannot
be abused
to any bad purpose , without
incurring
a suitable
punishment
: whereas it never can be used to
any good
one , when under the
control of an inspector .
So true will it be found , that to censure the licentious
ness , is to maintain
the liberty, of the press .

XI.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
PUBLIC
TRADE .
OFFENCES
against public trade , so far as they fall within
the scope of this portion of our Commentaries , may very
briefly be discussed:-
I.
Smuggling
is the offence of importing
goods without
paying the duties
imposed
thereon by the laws
of the
customs
and
excise, or of importing
or exporting
goods
which
are prohibited .
This was from time to time re
strained by statutes , which
have
been
recast and
con
solidated in the
16
& 17 Vict .
c.
107 , whereby
persons
are to be adjudged guilty of felony:
1. Who , to the number of three or more armed with fire
arms or other offensive weapons , are within the United
Kingdom , or within the limits of any port , harbour , or creek
thereof , assembled in order to be aiding and assisting in
the illegal landing , running , or carrying
away of any pro
hibited
goods , or goods liable to
duties
which
have not
been paid , or secured , or in rescuing or taking
away such
goods after seizure from the officer of the customs or other
officer authorised
to seize the
same , or from any person
or persons employed by them or assisting
them , or from
the place where the same have been
lodged by them , or
in rescuing any person who may have been apprehended
for
an
offence
made
felony by any act
relating
to the
customs , or in preventing
the apprehension of any person
guilty of such offence , and any persons
who , to the number

of three or more , so armed as aforesaid within the United
Kingdom, or within
the limits of any
port , harbour ,
or
creek thereof, are so aiding or assisting (a).
2. Any person who , in company with
more than
four
others , is found with any goods liable to forfeiture
under
any act relating
to the customs
or excise , or in company
with one
other person within
five miles of the sea - coast
or of any navigable
river , and carrying
offensive arms or
weapons
, or disguised in any way (b).
By the 244th section , any person who , after sunset and
before sunrise , between the 21st of September and 1st of
April , or after
eight in the evening and before six in the
morning , at any other time in the year , makes , aids , or
assists in making
any signal , on board
any vessel , or on
any part of the coast of the United
Kingdom , or within
six miles of the coast , for the purpose of giving notice to
any person
on board any smuggling
vessel, is rendered
guilty of a misdemeanor (c).

OFFENCES
AGAINST
PUBLIC TRADE .
III. Cheat
ing.
before the filing of the petition for adjudication , pawned ,
pledged , or disposed of otherwise than by bona fide trans-
actions in the ordinary way of his trade , any of his goods
or
chattels
which
have
been
obtained
on
credit
and
remain unpaid for.
III. Cheating
is
another
offence ,
more
immediately
against public trade ;
as that cannot be carried on without
a punctilious
regard to
common
honesty , and faith be-
tween man and
man .
Hither therefore may be referred
that
prodigious
multitude
of statutes , which
have been
made to restrain and punish
deceits
in particular
trades ,
and which
are
enumerated by Hawkins and Burn , but
are chiefly of use among traders themselves (e).
Fraud , when
levelled
at
the
public , is
indictable
at
common law (ƒ) ;
and to this head of cheating is refer-
able in a peculiar
manner the offence of selling
by false
weights and measures ; the standard of which fell under
our consideration in a former volume (g).
Forgery
also is indictable
at common law (h) ;
ex. gr.,
the uttering of a forged testimonial
to character , knowing
it to be forged (i) .
And if a person in the
course of his
trade or business , openly and publicly carried
on , put
a
false
mark
or token upon an article
so
as to pass it off
as genuine when in fact it is
spurious , and the
article is
sold and money is obtained by means of that
false mark
or token , that will constitute
a cheat at common law (k) .

CHEATING .
187
For the repression of this latter
form of fraud , viz ., the
fraudulent
marking
of
merchandise , has
recently
been
enacted
the statute
25 & 26 Vict . c. 88 , whereby is de
clared guilty of a misdemeanor ( 1) :
1. Every person who , with intent
to defraud (m ) , or to
enable
another
to defraud ,
any person ,
shall
forge
or
counterfeit (n), or cause
or procure to be forged
or coun
terfeited , any trade-mark (0) , or shall apply , or cause to
be applied , any trade-mark to any article
not being the
manufacture , production ,
or merchandise of any person
denoted
or intended to be denoted by such trade -mark ,
or not being the manufacture , production , or merchandise
of any person
whose trade -mark shall be
so
forged
or
counterfeited , or shall
apply , or cause
to be applied , any
trade -mark to any chattel , not being the particular
or
peculiar description of manufacture , production , or mer

Punishment :
imprisonment
for not more
than two years , with
or without hard
labour , or fine , or
both
by
imprisonment
with
or
without
hard
labour
and fine , and
also
imprisonment
until the
fine
(if any ) shall have
been paid
and
satisfied .
S. 14.
Also , by ss. 2 and 3, a forfeiture
of the
chattel
to which the trade
mark has been fraudulently
applied
is incurred by the misdemeanant .
And by s. 4, the vendor of a chattel
which he knows
to bear
a fraud
ulent
trade -mark
is
liable
to
a
penalty.
(m) By s. 12 an intention
to de
fraud
any particular
person
need
not be alleged in the indictment
, or
proved
; but it shall be sufficient to
allege
and
prove , with
respect to
every
such
misdemeanor
and
of
fence , that the
person
accused did
the act charged
with intent to de
fraud , or with intent to enable some
-
:
other person to defraud .
(n) By
s.
5,
every
addition
to
and
alteration
or imitation
of
a
trade -mark
made with
intent
to
defraud ,
shall be
deemed
to
be
a
forged
and
counterfeit
trade
mark .
11
(0) By s. 1, the expression " trade
mark " is
defined
to
include
any
name , label , or mark
lawfully used
by any person to denote a chattel to
be of the
manufacture , production ,
or merchandise of such
person , or
to be an
article
of any
particular
description
made
or sold by such
person , and shall
also include
any
name , mark , or sign which in pur
suance of any
statute
relating
to
registered designs is to be put upon
or attached to any chattel
or article
during the
existence of any copy
right or
other
sole right acquired
under
the
provisions
of
such
statute .

Besides
the foregoing statute , which has been directed
against
an ordinary

of fraud productive of per
nicious

beginning of the reign
of king
James
the First :
but
was in great measure remedied by statute 21 Jac.
1 , c. 3 ,
which declared
such monopolies , except as to patents , to
be contrary to law and void (x).
It is also worthy
of remark
that " every practice
or
device by art , conspiracy , words , or news to enhance the
price of victuals
or other merchandise ," was punishable
by the
common law (y) , and that
the 7 & 8 Vict . c. 24
(an act for abolishing
the
offences
of forestalling
(z) , re-
grating (a) , and engrossing (b) , and for repealing certain
statutes passed in restraint of trade), provides (s . 4) that
nothing therein
contained " shall be construed
to apply
to the
offence of knowingly
or fraudulently
spreading or
conspiring to spread
any false
rumour
with intent to
enhance or decry the price of any goods or merchandise ,
or to the offence of preventing
or endeavouring to prevent
by force
or threats
any goods,
wares ,
or merchandise ,
being brought
to any fair or market , but that every such
offence may be inquired of, tried , and punished " as before
the passing of the
act.

(a) Regrating
is described by the
statute 5 & 6 Edw . 6, c. 14, to be
the buying of corn , or other
dead
victual , in any market , and
selling
it again

have by various
statutes
been rendered or declared to be illegal , and combinations
accompanied with
violence
are in some
cases
severely
punishable .
The law
relating
to combinations
amongst
workmen
is for the most part set forth in the stat. 6 Geo. 4 , c. 129
(repealing many former
enactments
upon
the subject ) as
amended by the 22 Vict . c. 34.
The first -mentioned statute
renders it illegal " by violence to the person or property ,
or by threats
or intimidation
, or by molesting
or in any
way obstructing
another," to force or endeavour to force
any workman
to leave
his
employment , or to return his
work unfinished , or to prevent him from hiring himself,
or to compel him to belong to any club or association ,
or to
contribute
to any common fund , or to pay any fine
or penalty , or to use violence , threats , or intimidation to or
molest or obstruct any workman
on account of his refusing
to comply with any resolutions
or regulations
concerning
the rate of wages, the hours of working, and so forth, or
in like manner , as above set forth, to force or endeavour
to force any manufacturer
to alter the mode of carrying
on his
business (c) .
Provided
that it shall not be illegal
for persons to meet together for the sole purpose of con
sulting upon and determining
the rate of wages or prices
or the hours of work , whether the persons so meeting be
the workmen (d)
or the masters (e) .
An infraction of
the above enactment subjects the offender upon summary
conviction
to imprisonment
with or without hard
labour
for any time not exceeding three calendar
months (ƒ) ;
an appeal, however , lies
against
such conviction
to the
quarter
sessions.
The
22 Vict.
c.

and
enacts as follows : " That no workman

deemed
to
be
guilty of " molestation "

the
meaning

person wilfully committing
an assault in pursuance of an
unlawful combination

concerned
therein , shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor (h),

to
any such person with
intent to hinder or prevent him from exercising the same,
shall , on conviction
thereof

enactments (k) any person hindering the
exportation of corn by violence or destroying granaries or
grain intended for exportation , or using violence to deter
others from

corn within the kingdom , or unlaw

THE fourth
species
of
offences
,
more especially
affecting
the commonwealth
,
are
such
as
are against
the public
health
and safety
,
morals
and economy
;
matters
of
the
highest importance
,
and for the preservation
of
which our
magistrates
and police
have been charged with
special
duties by the legislature
.
In
this
chapter
,
however
,
our
attention will mainly be directed
to
indictable
offences
referable to the class indicated
.
Minor infractions
of the
law
,
belonging
to
the
same class
,
which
are summarily
punishable
,
being for the most part unnoticed

Regard

the remarks

our
present subject
naturally
subdivides itself into two por
tions
,
of
which
the
first
includes
offences
against
the
public health and safety
;
and the second
includes offences
against the public
morals and economy
.
I.
Foremost
amongst
offences
prejudicial
to
the public
health
is
that
of
infringing the quarantine
laws
,
which
impose

probation
upon
ships
coming
from
infected

II.
Irrespective
of statute , certain
acts obviously cal- II . Other
culated
to prejudice
the public
health are, on grounds of lated to pre
policy , indictable .
Thus it has been held
indictable
to public
expose
in a public thoroughfare
a person labouring
under
a contagious
disease (d) ; or to bring
a glandered
horse
into a public
place at the risk of causing infection
to the
queen's
subjects (e) ; and it is a misdemeanor at common
law to give
to any person injurious
food to
eat , whether
the offender be incited thereto by malice , or, by a desire
of gain ; and whether he be a public
contractor or other

either the
doing of a thing to the annoyance of all the
queen's
subjects , or the neglecting
to do a thing which
the common
good
requires (g) .
The
nature of common
or public nuisances ,
and their
distinction
from
private
nuisances , were explained in the preceding volume ; when
we considered more particularly
the nature of a private
nuisance
as
a civil injury to
individuals
. I shall here
only remind the student , that common nuisances are such
inconvenient
or troublesome
offences , as annoy the whole
community in general , not merely some particular
person ;
and therefore
are indictable , not actionable : as it would
be unreasonable to multiply suits , by giving every man a
separate right of action , for what
damnifies him in com
mon only with the rest of his fellow -subjects .
The class
of indictable
nuisances is
accordingly
very large ,
com
prising acts dissimilar
in kind , though in one particular
agreeing-that they are done ad commune
nocumentum (h).
Some
such
acts
which
are
criminal
and
indictable
as
injurious
to public
decency
and decorum , will be specified
in
the second
subdivision
of
this
chapter .
Amongst
public
nuisances
directly
affecting
the
public
health ,
safety, and well -being may here be mentioned:
1. Annoyances
in ,
or
closely
adjoining
to (i) , high
ways (k) , or affecting
bridges (1) , and
public
rivers (m) ,
by rendering
the
same
inconvenient
or
dangerous
to
pass ,
either
positively , by
actual
obstructions
( n ) ,
or
negatively , by want of reparations .

of these ,

person
so

as
are
bound to repair and cleanse them , or (in default of these
last) the parish

to
repair and amend them , and in some cases fined (o).
2.
Offensive
trades
and
manufactures , which
when
detrimental to the public , are indictable (p), and subject
the party
erecting
or continuing
the
nuisance to
fine
according
to the
nature
of the
misdemeanor
:
such a
nuisance
can only be defined
as
above
in general terms ,
and the true character of the act complained of must in
each case be determined upon the evidence in accordance
with
principles
analogous
to those
which
have
been
already
specified
in
relation
to
a
private
and
merely
actionable nuisance (q) : negligently
to blast
stone in a
quarry adjoining
a highway , and thus to cause danger to
the public ,
would
clearly
be
indictable (r) .
And an
indictment
for a nuisance might lie against the owner of
works carried
on
for
his
profit ,
although
the
nuisance
was caused by the acts of the defendant's
workmen , done
in carrying
on the works
without
his
knowledge ,
and
contrary to his general orders (s).
In accordance with the
rule
that
an act done ad com-
mune nocumentum
is indictable , it has been
held that to
manufacture
or to keep in large
quantities
in towns
or
closely inhabited
places gunpowder
or other dangerous ,
ignitable
and explosive substances
, is so by the common
(0)
Where
a
house
has
been
erected, or an inclosure
made , upon
any part of the
demesnes of the
crown,
or of a highway ,
or
com-
mon street , or public
water , or such
like
public
things , it is
properly
called
a " purpresture ," from
the
French pourpris , an inclosure .

statute for the
repression
of
nuisances ,
such
as

And for a like reason would it be so to convey
an inflammable

or to manufacture

subjects (x).
With
a view , however ,
to repressing
the
nuisances just
specified
, the legislature
has, by various
recent enactments efficiently provided (y) .
Also by the
statute 24 & 25 Vict . c. 100 , (which con-
cerns
offences
against
the
person , )
any
one
who
shall
knowingly have in his possession , or make or manufacture
any gunpowder , explosive

noxious
thing , or
any machine , engine ,
instrument ,
or
thing , with intent by means thereof to commit , or for the
purpose of enabling
any other person to commit , any of
the felonies in the

OFFENCES
RELATING
TO MARRIAGE .
199
The individuals of the state, like members of a well-
governed
family , are
bound
to
conform
their
general
behaviour
to the rules of propriety , decorum
and
good
manners ; and to be decent, industrious , and inoffensive
in their respective
stations .
The class of offences
before
us is accordingly
somewhat miscellaneous , comprising
all
such crimes
as especially
affect public
society , and the
domestic
order of the kingdom , and
are
not
compre-
hended under any of the preceding
species .
I.
Offences relating
to marriage will be first noticed ; I. Offences
they are as under :
1. Any
person who , falsely pretending
to be in holy
orders , solemnizes
matrimony
according
to the rites of
the Church of England , and knowingly and wilfully
so
offends , is guilty of felony (a) .
2. By the 6 & 7 Will . 4 , c. 85 (6) , which
allows
mar-
riages to be solemnized in dissenting places of worship , cer-
tified according to law, and registered as therein directed , or
before the superintendent registrar of the district , (ss . 18 ,
21 ,) it is declared (s.
39 ) to be felony knowingly and
wilfully to solemnize
any
marriage ,
except by
special
licence, in any
other
place
than
a church
or chapel in
which
marriages
may be solemnized ,
according
to the
rites of the
Church of England , or than the registered
building
or office specified in the notice
and
certificate
given according
to that act, or knowingly to solemnize
any marriage in any such registered building or office , in
the absence of a registrar of the district

BIGAMY .
201
4. Another felonious
offence , with regard to the estate
of matrimony , is bigamy , which
properly signifies
being
twice
married .
A second
marriage , living the former
husband
or wife , is simply
void , and a mere nullity , by
the ecclesiastical law of England : and yet the legislature
has thought
fit
to
make
it
felony
,
by reason
of
its being
so
great
a
violation
of
the public
economy and decency of
a
well
-
ordered state
.
Polygamy
can
never
be endured
under any rational
civil establishment
,
whatever specious
reasons may be urged
for
it
by the
eastern
nations
,
the
fallaciousness
of
which
has
been fully
proved by many
sensible writers
:
but in northern countries the very nature
of
the climate seems
to
reclaim against
it
;
it
never having
obtained
in
this part
of
the world
,
even from the time
of
our German
ancestors
,
who
,
as
Tacitus informs
us
,"
prope
soli barbarorum singulis uxoribus contenti sunt
."
And with
us
in
England
it
is
enacted
by statute
,
24
&
25 Vict
.
c.
100
,
s.
57
,
that whosoever
,
being
married
,
shall
marry
any other
person during the
life
of
the
former
husband
or
wife
,
whether the second marriage
shall
have taken
place
in
England
or
elsewhere
,
shall
be
guilty
of
felony
;
and
any
such
offender
may be
tried
in
any place
in
England
,
where he shall
be
apprehended
or
be
in
custody
,
in
the same manner
in
all respects
as
if
the
offence had
been
actually
committed
there
(g):
but
this
enactment

does not
extend
(1)
to
any second marriage
contracted
elsewhere than
in

have been con

have been known

II. The next offence to be mentioned more immediately
II. Offences
against
cency.
public de
against
morality , and cognizable by the temporal courts ,
is that of public indecency , which
is indictable
as a mis
demeanor (k).
The selling an obscene print, or exposing
it for sale, is thus
indictable (1) , and for
such offence a
punishment
has been assigned by statute (m ).
In the year 1650 , when the ruling powers found it for
their
interest to put on the
semblance of a very extra
ordinary
strictness
and purity of morals , not only incest
and wilful
adultery were
made capital
crimes ; but
also
the
repeated
act of
keeping
a brothel , or
committing
fornication , were (upon a second
conviction ) made felony
without benefit of clergy (n ) . But at the restoration , when
men , from
an abhorrence
of the hypocrisy
of the
late
times , fell into a contrary
extreme of licentiousness , it
was not thought
proper to renew a law of such unfashion
able rigour .
And these
offences
have been ever since left
to the feeble coercion of the spiritual
court , according to
the rules of the
canon law ; a law which has treated the
offence of incontinence , nay , even adultery
itself, with
a
great degree of tenderness
and lenity ; owing perhaps to the
(i) In the Duchess of Kingston's
case, the judges
were unanimously
of
opinion
that
a
sentence
in
a
spiritual
court
against
a marriage
in
a suit of jactitation of marriage
is not conclusive
evidence , so as to
estop the counsel for the crown from
proving
the marriage in an indict
ment
for
bigamy .
And that ad
mitting
such
sentence to
be con
clusive
upon
such
indictment
, the
counsel for the crown
may be ad
mitted
to avoid
the
effect of such
sentence , by proving
the
same to
have been obtained by fraud
or col
lusion .

person returning to
or place to be a common
gaming
house , it shall be sufficient , in sup
port of the allegation
in any indict

to prove that such house or place is
kept or used for playing
therein
at
any unlawful game, and that a bank
is kept there by one or more of the
players
exclusively
of the
others ,
or that the chances of any game
played therein
are not alike favour
able to all the players , including
among the
players
the
banker
or
other person by whom
the
game is
managed , or against whom the other

CHAPTER XIII.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
THE PERSON .
In the
eight preceding
chapters we have considered ,
first , such
crimes
as are more immediately
injurious
to
God , and religion ; secondly , such as violate or transgress
the law of nations ; thirdly , such as more especially affect
the sovereign ; fourthly, such as more directly
infringe
the rights of the public
or commonwealth , taken in
its
collective
capacity
;
we
are
now ,
lastly,
to
take
into
consideration
those
crimes
which
in
a more
peculiar
manner affect and injure individuals
or private subjects .
Were
these injuries ,
indeed ,
confined
to individuals
,
they would fall under
the notion of private wrongs ; for
which
a
satisfaction
would
be
due
only
to
the
party
injured .
But the wrongs
which we are now to treat of
affect
the
entire
community .
1.
Because they
cannot
in general
be committed without a violation of the laws
of nature ; of the moral as well as political rules of right.
2. Because they include in them
almost always a breach
of the
public
peace , or
else
the ingredient of malice , or
of fraud
affecting
the
public .
3.
Because by
their
ex-
ample and evil
tendency they
threaten
and endanger the
subversion of all civil society.
Upon these accounts it is ,
that besides any private
satisfaction due and given to the
individual
injured
by action for the private
wrong , the
government
also
calls
upon the offender to
submit to
punishment
for the public
crime .
And the prosecution
of these offences
is at the
suit
and in the
name of the
sovereign , in whom , by the texture of our constitution ,
VOL . IV.

the executory
power of the law
entirely resides .
Thus,
too , in the old Gothic
constitution , there was a threefold
punishment
inflicted on a delinquent
: first , for the private
wrong
to the party
injured
;
secondly , for the
offence
against the king by disobedience to the laws ; and thirdly ,
for the crime
against the public by his
evil example (a) .
Of which we may trace the groundwork , in what
Tacitus
tells us of his Germans (6) ; that , whenever offenders
were
fined , "pars mulctæ
regi, vel civitati , pars ipsi qui vindi
catur vel propinquis
ejus , exsolvitur."
Offences against private subjects are principally of two
kinds (c) ; first, against
their
persons ; secondly , against
their property .
I. Of crimes injurious
to the persons of private
subjects ,
againstthe the most principal
and important is the offence

of which therefore no man can be entitled to deprive him
self or
another , but in some manner
either
expressly
commanded
in ,
or evidently
deducible
from
those laws
which the Creator has given us ; the divine laws of either
nature or revelation .
The
subject , therefore , in the pre
sent chapter first to be considered will be the offence of
homicide ,
or destroying
the life of man , the particular
circumstances of mitigation
or aggravation
which
attend
it, and the punishment
of this offence .
Homicide , or the killing of any human
creature , is by
our
customary
law,
1.
justifiable
;
2.
excusable ; or , 3.
felonious ;
and
although ,
as
presently
stated, the last
mentioned only of these three species
of homicide is now
indictable
and punishable , a few remarks
as to each of
the two former , may with a view to rendering intelligible
the nature of felonious homicide
be proper .
1. Justifiable homicide is of divers kinds .

(1.) Such
as is owing to some unavoidable
necessity , (1.) of
ne-
without any will

intention
,
or
desire
,
and without
any
inadvertence
or
negligence
in
the party killing
,
and there-
fore without
any shadow
of
blame
.
As
,
for instance
,
by
virtue of such an office
as
obliges
one
,
in
the execution of
public justice
,
to
put
a
malefactor
to
death
,
who has for-
feited his life by the laws
and
verdict
of
his
country
.
This
is
an act
of
necessity
,
and
even
of
civil duty
;
and
therefore
not
only
justifiable
,
but commendable
,
where
the law requires
it
.
But the law must require
it
,
other-
wise
it
is
not justifiable
:
therefore
,
wantonly
to
kill the
greatest
of
malefactors
,
a
felon
,
or
a
traitor
,
attainted
,
or
outlawed
,
deliberately
,

and extrajudicially

(d).
For
,
as
Bracton
(e)
very justly
observes
,
"

,
si

,
vel
delectatione
effun-
dendi humanum sanguinem
,
licet juste occidatur iste
,
tamen
occisor peccat mortaliter
,
propter

corruptam
.'
And further
,
if
judgment
of
death
be
given by
a
judge not
authorised
by lawful commission
,
and execution
is
done
.
accordingly
,
the judge
is
guilty
of
murder
(ƒ
).
And upon
this account Sir Matthew
Hale
,
though
he
accepted
the
place
of
a
judge
of
the Common
Pleas under Cromwell's
government
,
yet declined
to
sit on the crown side
at
the
assizes
,
and try prisoners
;
having
strong
objections
to
the legality
of
the Protector's
commission
(g
);
a
distinc-
tion
,
perhaps
,
rather too refined
;
since the punishment
of
crimes
is
at
least
as
necessary
to
society
,
as
maintaining
the boundaries
of
property
.
Also such judgment
,
when
legal
,
must
be executed
by the proper officer
,
or
his ap-
pointed deputy
;
for no one else
is
required by law
to
do
it;
which requisition
it
is,
that justifies
the homicide
.
If
another person
does
it
of his
own head
,
it
is
held
to
be
murder
();
even though
it
be the judge himself

must further be
executed
, servato juris ordine ; it must
pursue the
sentence
of the
court . If an officer beheads
one who
is adjudged
to be
hanged , or
vice
versâ, it is
murder (k): for
the
officer is
merely
ministerial
, and
therefore only justified when he acts
under the authority
and compulsion of the law : but if a sheriff
changes one
kind of death for another , he then acts by his own autho
rity , which
extends
not to the commission of homicide ,
and besides, this
licence
might occasion a very
gross
abuse of his power.
(2.) Homi

(2. ) Again ; in some cases homicide is justifiable
, rather
of justice
by the permission , than by the absolute command of the
law, either for the advancement of public
justice , which
without
such indemnification
would
never be carried on
with proper vigour : or, where it is
committed
for the
prevention of some atrocious crime , which
cannot other
wise be avoided .
Homicide
committed
for the advancement of
public
justice , is , where an officer , in the execution of his office ,
either in a civil or criminal
case , kills a person who assaults
and resists him ( ) ; or where an officer, or any private per
son, attempts to take a man charged with felony , and is
resisted ; and , in the endeavour to take him , kills him (m).
This is similar to the
old
Gothic constitutions , which

informs
us (n) ) "furem, si aliter

posset, occidere permittunt ." In case of a riot, or rebellious.

to disperse the mob
are justifiable in killing
them , both at common law (0),
and by the Riot Act ,

Where

all these
cases , there must be an apparent necessity on
the officer's
side ; viz . that the person
could

vent crime.
(3. ) In the next place , homicide committed for the pre- (3.) To pre
vention of any forcible
and atrocious crime , is justifiable
by the law of nature (r) ; and also by the law of England,
as it stood so early as the time of Bracton (s) , and as it
was declared by statute 24 Hen . 8,
c. 5. If any person
attempts
a robbery or murder of another , or attempts to
break
open
a house, in the night time (which
extends
also to an attempt
to burn it (t) ) , and be killed in such
attempt , the slayer shall be acquitted
and discharged (u) .
This reaches not to any crime unaccompanied with force,
as picking of pockets ; or to
the
breaking
open of any
house in the day time , unless it carries with it an attempt
of robbery also .
So the Jewish law, which
punished no
theft with death , makes
homicide
only justifiable
in case
of nocturnal
house-breaking
; " if a thief be found break
ing up , and he be smitten
that he die, no blood shall be
shed
for him
but if the sun be risen
upon him, there
shall
blood be shed
for him ; for he should
have made
full
restitution (x)."
At Athens , if any theft was com
mitted
by night, it was lawful
to kill the
criminal , if
taken
in the fact (y) :
and by the
Roman
law of the
twelve
tables ,
a thief
might
be
slain
by night
with
impunity
or
even by day, if he armed himself with
any
dangerous weapon (~) : which amounts very nearly
:

(u) We read also that , if thieves
come to
a man's
house to rob or
murder
him, and the owner
or his
servants kill
any of the thieves
in
defence of himself
and his
house,
this is not felony .

2. Excu-
sable Homi-
cide.
(1.) Homi-
cide by mis-
to the
same
as is
permitted
by our
own
constitu-
tion (a).
:
The
Roman
law also justified
homicide , when com-
mitted in
defence
of the
chastity either of one's
self or
relations
(b )
and
so also, according
to Selden (c) , stood
the law in the Jewish republic .
The English law likewise
justifies
a woman killing
one who
attempts
to ravish
her (d)
and so too
the
husband
or father
may justify
killing
a man , who
attempts
a rape upon his wife or
daughter : but not if he takes a man in adultery by con-
sent, for the
one is forcible and felonious , but
not the
other (e).
And doubtless the forcibly attempting
a crime
of a still more detestable nature , may be equally resisted
by the death of the unnatural
aggressor (ƒ).
In these
instances of justifiable homicide , it may be
observed that the slayer is in no kind of fault whatsoever ,
not even in the minutest
degree
; he is indeed deserving
of commendation rather than of blame .
2. Excusable
homicide is of two sorts : either per infor-
tunium, by misadventure
;
or
se
defendendo , upon a prin-
ciple
of self-preservation .
We will first
see
wherein
these
two
species
of homicide
are
distinct ,
and then
wherein they agree.
(1.) Homicide per infortunium or misadventure , is where
adventure.
a man , doing a lawful act, without
any intention of hurt ,
unfortunately kills
another : as where a man is at work
with a hatchet , and the head thereof flies off, and kills a
stander -by ; or where a person shooting at a mark , in
a
place
fit
and proper
for the
purpose
,
undesignedly
and
without
negligence
,
kills
a
man

and the effect is merely accidental .
So where a parent is
moderately
correcting his child, a master his apprentice or
scholar , or an officer
punishing
a criminal , and happens to
occasion his death , it is only misadventure ; for the act of
correction
is lawful :
but if he
exceeds
the bounds
of
moderation , either in the manner , the instrument , or the
quantity of punishment ,
and death
ensues , it is man
slaughter
at least , and in some cases
(according
to the
circumstances ) may be murder (h) ; for immoderate
cor
rection
is
unlawful .
Thus , by an edict of the
Emperor
Constantine (i), when the rigour of the Roman law with
regard to slaves began to relax
and soften , a master was
allowed
to chastise his slave with rods and imprisonment
,
and , if death
accidentally
ensued , he was guilty of no
crime
but if he struck
him with a club
or a stone , and
thereby occasioned his death ; or if in any other yet grosser
manner , " immoderatè
suo jure utatur , tunc reus homicidii
sit."
:
But to proceed.
A tilt or
tournament , the
martial
diversion of our ancestors , was an unlawful act
and
so
are boxing and sword-playing (k) , the succeeding amuse
ments of their posterity : therefore , if a principal , whilst
engaged in such contention , chance to kill his
opponent ,
he will be guilty of manslaughter .
Likewise to whip
another's
horse, whereby he runs over a child
and kills
him, may render the person who whipped the horse guilty
of manslaughter
, for the act was a trespass , and at best a
piece of mischief , of inevitably
dangerous consequence
( 1) .
And in general , if death ensues in consequence of an idle ,
dangerous , and unlawful
sport ,
as
shooting
or casting
stones in a town , in such and similar
cases , the slayer is
guilty of manslaughter , and
not
misadventure
only , for
these are unlawful acts (m).

(2.) Homi-
cide in self-
defence.
(2. ) Homicide
in self-defence , or se defendendo , upon a
sudden
affray ,
is
excusable by the English
law.
This
species
of self-defence
must be
distinguished
from that
just now mentioned , as calculated to hinder
the perpetra-
tion of a crime : which is not only a matter of excuse, but
of justification
.
But the
self -defence
which we are now
speaking of, is that whereby a man may protect himself
from
an assault or the like , in the
course of a sudden
broil or quarrel , by killing
the
person who assaults him .
And this is what
the law expresses by the word chance-
medley , or (as
some rather
choose
to write it) chaud-
medley , the former of which in its etymology signifies
a
casual affray , the latter
an affray in the heat of blood
or
passion ; both expressions being of pretty much the same
import
but the former
is in common
speech
too often
erroneously
applied
to
any manner of homicide by mis-
adventure ; whereas it appears by the statute 24 Hen . 8 ,
c. 5 , and our ancient
books (n), that it is properly appli-
cable to such killing
as happens in self-defence
upon
a
sudden rencontre (o) .
This right of natural
defence
does
not imply a right of attacking
: for , instead of attacking
one another for injuries past or impending , men need only
have
recourse to the proper
tribunals
of justice .
They
cannot
therefore legally exercise this right of preventive
defence , but in sudden and violent cases when certain and
immediate suffering would be the consequence
of waiting
for the assistance of the law.
Wherefore , to excuse homi-
cide by the plea of self- defence , it must appear that
the
slayer had no other possible (or, at least , probable) means
of escaping from his assailant .
It is frequently
difficult
to distinguish
this
species of
homicide (upon chance-medley in self-defence ) from that
of manslaughter , in the proper legal sense of the word (p) .
But the true criterion
for discriminating
between them

HOMICIDE .
217
seems to be this : when both
parties
are
actually
com-
bating at the time when the mortal
stroke is given , the
slayer is then guilty of manslaughter
: but if the slayer
has not begun to fight, or (having
begun ) endeavours
to
decline any further
struggle , and afterwards , being closely
pressed
by his antagonist , kills
him
to
avoid his
own
destruction , this is homicide excusable by self- defence (9) .
For which reason
the law requires , that the person , who
kills another in his own
defence , should have retreated as
far as he conveniently
or safely can, to avoid the violence
of the assault , before he turns
upon his assailant ; and
that not fictitiously
, or in order to watch his opportunity
,
but from a real tenderness of shedding his brother's blood .
And though it may be cowardice , in time of war between
two independent
nations , to
flee from an enemy
; yet be-
tween two
fellow -subjects the law countenances
no such
point of honour : because
the sovereign and his courts are
the vindices injuriarum
, and will give to the party wronged
all the satisfaction
he deserves (r) .
In this the civil law
agrees with ours ,
or perhaps
goes
rather
further : "qui
cum
aliter
tueri
se
non possunt , damni culpam
dederint,
innoxii sunt ” (s).
The party assaulted must therefore flee
as far as he conveniently
can , i. e. , until stopped by reason
of some wall, ditch , or other impediment
; or as far as the
fierceness of the assault will permit him (t) ; for it may
be so fierce as not to allow him to yield a step, without
manifest
danger of his life , or enormous bodily harm ; and
then in his defence
he may kill
his
assailant
instantly.
And this is the doctrine of universal justice (u) , as well as
of the municipal law.
And , as the manner of the
defence , so is also the time
to be considered : for if the person assaulted does not fall
upon the aggressor till the
affray is over, or falls
upon
him when he is running
away, this is revenge , and
not

defence .
Neither , under , the colour of self- defence , will
the law permit a man to screen
himself from the guilt of
deliberate murder : for if two persons , A and B , agree to
fight a duel , and A gives the first onset, and B retreats
as far as he safely can, and then kills A, this
is murder ;
because of the previous
malice
and concerted design (x) .
But if A upon
a sudden
quarrel , assaults B first, and
upon B's returning
the
assault , A really
and
boná fide
flees ;
and , being driven
to the wall , turns
again upon
B and kills him ; this may be
se
defendendo , according
to
some of
our
writers (y) ;
though
others (≈)
have
thought
this
opinion
too
favourable
;
inasmuch
as
the
necessity , to which
he
is
at
last
reduced ,
originally
arose
from
his own fault.
Under this
excuse , of self-
defence, the principal
civil and natural
relations are com-
prehended ;
therefore ,
master
and
servant , parent
and
child, husband and wife , killing an assailant in the neces-
sary defence
of each
other respectively , are excused ; the
act of the relation assisting
being
construed the same as
the act of the party himself (a).
There is one
species of homicide
se defendendo , where
the party killed
is equally innocent
as he who occasions
his death
and yet this
homicide
is also excusable from
the
great
universal
principle
of self - preservation , which
prompts every man to save his own life preferably to that
of another , where
one
of them
must
inevitably
perish .
As,
among
others ,
in that
case
mentioned
by Lord
Bacon (6) , where two
persons , being
shipwrecked ,
and
getting
on the same plank , but finding it not able to save
them both , one of them thrusts
the other from it , whereby
he is drowned .
He who thus preserves
his own life at the
expense of another man's is excusable through
unavoid-
able
necessity , and the
principle
of self- defence ; since
their both remaining on the same weak plank is a mutual ,

though
innocent , attempt
upon , and an endangering of,
each other's life .
To excusable
homicide
some
slight
degree of guilt was
formerly
attached
by
our law.
Nor
was
the
law of
England singular
in this
respect.
Even the
slaughter
of enemies required a solemn purgation
among the Jews ;
implying that the death of a man ,
however it happens ,
will leave some stain behind it.
And the Mosaical law (c)
appointed certain cities of refuge for him " who killed his
neighbour unawares : as if a man goeth into the wood with

it seems he was not held wholly blameless , any more than

him

imperial law likewise (d) casual homicide was excused , by
the indulgence of the emperor signed with his own sign

Saxony a fine was paid to the kindred of the slain ; which
also , among the Western
Goths , was little inferior to that
of voluntary

is said by sir E, Coke to have been
anciently no less than
death ( ); which however is with reason denied by later
writers (k).
It seems
rather
to have consisted in a for
feiture , some
say of all the
goods and chattels , others of
only part of them by way of fine or weregild ( 1) : which was
probably disposed of in pios usus , according to the humane
superstition of the times , for the benefit of his soul who
was thus suddenly sent to his account, with all his imper
fections on his head.
But that reason having long ceased ,
and the penalty (especially if a total forfeiture ) growing
more severe
than was intended , in proportion
as personal
property became more considerable , the delinquent
had , as
early as our records will
reach (m) , a pardon
and writ of
restitution of his goods
as a matter of course and right,
only paying for suing
out the same (n).
And
indeed
to
prevent this expense, in cases where the death had noto
riously happened by misadventure
or in self- defence , the
judge who presided at the trial of the accused , usually per
mitted , if not
directed , a general verdict of acquittal
(0) .
And now it is expressly enacted by the statute , 24 & 25 Vict.

law with cutting off the hand which committed
the
desperate
deed (g).
And also the law of England
wisely and religiously
considers , that
no man
possesses
power to destroy life , but by commission
from God the
author of it ; and as
the
suicide
is guilty of a double
offence ; one spiritual , in evading the prerogative of the
Almighty , and rushing
into his immediate
presence
un-
called for ; the other temporal , against the sovereign , who
has an interest in the preservation of all his subjects ; the
law has therefore ranked this among the highest crimes ,
making it a peculiar
species of felony , a felony committed
on one's
self.
If one
persuades another to kill
himself ,
and he does
so , the adviser is guilty of murder (r) .
And
if two persons agree to
commit
suicide , and accordingly ,
both take poison or attempt to drown themselves together ,
but one only of them dies, it is murder in the survivor (s).
Afelo de se , therefore , is he who deliberately puts an
end to his own existence , or commits any unlawful
mali-
cious act, the consequence
of which
is his own death : as
if, attempting
to kill
another , he runs
upon his antago-
nist's
sword ; or, shooting at another , the gun bursts and
kills himself (t).
The party must be of years of discretion ,
and in his
senses , else it is no crime .
But this
excuse
ought
not to be strained
to that length , to which
our
coroners ' juries are apt to
carry it, by holding
that
the
very
act of suicide
is
evidence
of insanity ; as if every
man who acts contrary
to
reason , had no reason at all :
for the same argument
would
prove
every other criminal
non compos , as well as , the self-murderer .
The law very
rationally judges , that every melancholy or hypochondriac
fit
does not deprive
a
man
of
the
capacity
of
discerning
right from wrong

And there-
fore , if a real lunatic
kills himself in a lucid interval , he
is a felo de se as much as another man (x) .
But now the question
follows , what
punishment
can
human
laws inflict on
one
who
has withdrawn
himself
from their
reach ?
They can only act upon what he has
left behind him , his reputation and fortune .
Accordingly, by stat . 4 Geo . 4, c .
52 , the remains of
persons against
whom a finding of felo de se is returned ,
are to be privately
buried
in the
church -yard
or other
burial ground of the parish
or place , where the remains
might have been otherwise interred , the interment to take
place within twenty -four hours from the finding the in-
quisition , between nine and twelve at night ; and without
performance of the rites of Christian
burial .
By suicide , also , the goods
and chattels of the felon
become forfeited
to the crown ; our law hoping
that
a
man's care for either his reputation , or the welfare of his
family may be some
motive to restrain him from so des-
perate and wicked an act.
And it is observable , that this
forfeiture has relation to the time of the act done in the
felon's lifetime , which was the cause of his death .
husband and wife be possessed jointly of a term of years
in land , and the husband
drowns himself ; the land shall
be forfeited to the crown , and the wife
shall
not have it
by survivorship .
For by the act of casting himself into
the water he forfeits
the term , which
gives a title to the
crown ,
prior to the
wife's
title by survivorship
, which
could not accrue till the instant of her husband's death (y) .
And though
it must be owned that the letter of the law
herein borders a little upon
severity , yet it is
some alle-
viation
that the power of mitigation
is left in the breast
of the sovereign , who upon this (as on all other like occa-
sions) is reminded
by the
oath of his
office
to execute
judgment in mercy .

Killing

and in this
offence
there
are
degrees
of
guilt which
divide
it into
manslaughter
and
murder .
The
difference
between
which
may be partly collected
from what has been incidentally
mentioned in the pre-
ceding articles , and principally consists in this , that man-
slaughter (when voluntary ) arises from the sudden heat
of the passions , murder from the wickedness of the heart .
(1. ) Manslaughter
is therefore
defined to be (2)—the (1.) Man-
unlawful
killing of another
without
malice
express
or
implied
which may be either voluntarily
, upon a sudden
heat ; or involuntarily , in the
commission of some un-
lawful
act .
These were called , in the Gothic
constitutions ,
"homicidia vulgaria ; quæ aut casu , aut etiam sponte
com-
mittuntur , sed in subitaneo
quodam
iracundiæ calore et im-
petu "(a).

hence it follows , that in manslaughter
there can be no
accessories
before the
fact ;
because

must be done without
premeditation .

this is manslaughter
: and
so it is , if they upon such an
occasion go out and fight in a field : for this is one con-
tinued act of passion ( b) : and the law pays that regard to
human frailty , as not to put a hasty and a deliberate act
upon the same footing with regard to guilt .
So also if a
man

another , as by pulling
his
nose , or
other like indignity, and the person aggrieved immediately
kills the aggressor , though this is not excusable
se defen-
dendo , since there is no absolute necessity for doing it to
preserve himself ; yet neither is it murder , in the absence
of previous malice ;
but it is manslaughter (c) .

act,
being
done through a
deliberate feeling of revenge, not in heat of blood , accord
ingly amounts to murder (d) .
So if a man takes another
in the act of adultery with
his wife , and kills the adul
terer directly upon the spot ; though this was allowed by
the laws
of Solon (e) ,
as
likewise
by the
Roman
civil
law (if the
adulterer
was found in the husband's
own
house (ƒ)) , and also among the ancient Goths (g) ; yet in
England it is not absolutely ranked in the class of justi
fiable homicide ,
as in case of a forcible
rape , but it is
manslaughter (h).
Manslaughter
, therefore , on a sudden
provocation differs from excusable homicide se defendendo
in this : that in one
case
there is an apparent
necessity ,
for self-preservation , to kill the aggressor : in the
other
no necessity at all , being only a sudden act of revenge .
As to the second branch ,-involuntary
manslaughter ,

also differs from homicide
excusable by misadventure , in
this ; that misadventure
always
happens in consequence
of a lawful act, but this
species of manslaughter in conse
quence of an unlawful one.
As if two
persons
play
at
sword
and buckler ,
unless , it is said (i), by the king's
command , and one of them kills the other : this is man
slaughter , because
the original act was unlawful ; but it
is not murder , if the one had no intent
to do the other
any personal mischief (k) .
So where a person does an act,
lawful in itself, but in an unlawful manner , and without
due
caution
and
circumspection :
as
when
a workman
flings down a stone or piece of timber into the street , and
kills
a

this
may be

misadventure , man

personal
duty , when death
ensues
as the consequence of
such neglect , may render the party guilty of it liable to an
indictment
for
manslaughter
;
but
not
only must the
neglect to make the party guilty of it liable to the charge
of felony be personal , the death must
have been the im
mediate result of that personal neglect (9) . If a physician
or surgeon gives his patient
a potion
or plaster
to cure
him ,
which ,
contrary to
expectation , kills him, this is
neither
murder , nor
manslaughter , but
misadventure
;
and it is dispunishable .
In regard to such cases the rule
applicable has been thus laid down .
There is here " no
difference between a licensed
physician
or surgeon , and a
person
acting
as
physician
or surgeon without
licence .
In either case , if a party , having
a competent
degree of
skill and knowledge , makes
an accidental mistake in his
treatment of a
patient , through
which
mistake
death
ensues , he is not thereby guilty of manslaughter ; but if,
where
proper medical
assistance
can
be had ,
a
person
totally ignorant of the
science of medicine takes on him
self to administer
a violent
and dangerous remedy to one
labouring
under disease , and death ensues in consequence
of that dangerous remedy having
been so administered
;
then
he is guilty of manslaughter " (r) .
We
may add
that if a wound , in itself not mortal , by improper
appli
cations
becomes
so , and
terminates
fatally ,
and it is
clearly shown that the medicine , not the wound , was the
cause of death, the party who inflicted the wound will not
be guilty of murder (s).
But where the wound was ade
quate to produce death , it will not be an
excuse
to show
of the horse , a conviction
for man
slaughter
may be had .

that, had proper care
been
taken , a recovery might have
been effected (t).
(2. ) We
are next to consider the crime of deliberate (2.) Murder.
and wilful
murder .
The
term
murder
was
anciently
applied to the
secret killing of another
(u) ;
(which
the
word moerda signifies
in the Teutonic
language (x) ;) and
it was defined, " homicidium quod
nullo
vidente ,
nullo
sciente , clam perpetratur " (y) : for which the vill wherein
it was committed , or (if that
were
too poor) the whole
hundred
was
liable
to
a
heavy
amercement ;
which
amercement
itself
was also
denominated
murdrum (z).
This was an ancient usage among the Goths in Sweden
and Denmark ; who
supposed
the neighbourhood , unless
they produced
the murderer ,
to have perpetrated
or at
least
connived
at
the
murder (a) :
and ,
according
to
Bracton (6) , the usage
was introduced
into this kingdom
by King
Canute , to prevent
his countrymen the Danes
from
being privily murdered by the English ; and was
afterwards
continued
by William
the Conqueror , for the
like security
to his own Normans (c).
Therefore , if, upon
inquisition
had, it appeared that the person found
slain
was an Englishman (the presentment
whereof was deno-
minated englescherie (d) ) , the country seems to have been
excused from this burthen .
But this usage being totally
abolished
by statute
14 Edw . 3, c. 4 , we must now (as is
observed by Staundforde ( e)) define murder in quite another
(t) Id., ib.
(u ) Dial . de Scacch . 1. 1, c. 10.
(x) Stiernh. de Jure
Sueon . 1. 3,

The word murdre in our old
statutes
also
signified
any kind of
concealment
or stifiing .
So in the
statute of Exeter ,
14 Edw. 1, "je
riens ne celerai , ne sufferai
estre celé

which
is thus
trans-
lated in Fleta , 1. 1,
c.
18, s. 4 :
" Nullam
veritatem
celabo, nec ce-
lari permittam nec murdari ."
And
the words "pur murdre

the articles
of that statute , are ren-
dered in Fleta , ibid. s. 8, " pro jure

manner , without regarding
whether
the party slain was
killed openly or secretly , or whether he was of English or
foreign extraction .
Murder
is
thus
defined
or
rather
described by
sir
Edward
Coke (f) ;
" when
a person
of sound
memory
and discretion , unlawfully
killeth any reasonable creature
in being , and under the king's
peace , with malice afore
thought , either
express or
implied ."
The best way of
examining
the nature of this crime will be by considering
the several branches of this definition .
1st. It
must
be
committed
by "a person of sound
memory and discretion : " for lunatics
or infants , as was
formerly
observed
(g) , are incapable of committing
crime :
unless in cases where they show a consciousness of doing
wrong , and of course a discretion , or capacity of discern
ing between good and evil .
Next, it happens when a person of such sound discre
tion " unlawfully killeth ."
The unlawfulness
arises from
the killing without
warrant
or excuse :
and there must
also be an actual killing to constitute murder .
The killing
may be by poisoning , striking, starving , drowning , and a
thousand
other forms of death , by which
human
nature
may be overcome.
Of all species of deaths, however , the
most detestable is that by poison ;
because
it can be the
least prevented either by manhood or by forethought (h).
And therefore by the statute 22 Hen . 8 , c. 9, it was made
treason , and a more grievous
and lingering kind of death
was inflicted on it than the common law allowed ; namely ,
boiling to death (2) : but this act did not live long , having
been repealed by statute 1 Edw . 6 , c. 12.
There was also,
by the ancient common law, one species of killing held to
(f) 3 Inst . 47.
(g) Ante , pp. 17, 19.
(h) 3 Inst. 48.
(i) This
extraordinary
punish
ment
seems to
have been adopted
by the legislature , from the
pecu
liar circumstances ofthe crime which
gave rise to it ; for the preamble
of
the statute
above cited
informs
us
that John Roose , a cook , had
been
lately convicted of throwing
poison
into a large pot of broth , prepared

be murder , which may be dubious at this day ; there not
having been an instance wherein it was adjudged
to be
murder for many
ages past (k) : I mean by bearing
false
witness
against
another , with an
express
premeditated
design to take away his life , so as the innocent person be
condemned and
executed
(1).
The Gothic
laws punished
in this case, both the judge, the witnesses , and the prose-
cutor : " peculiari poenâ judicem puniunt ; peculiari
testes ,
quorum fidesjudicem seduxit ; peculiari
denique
et maximâ
auctorem , ut homicidam " (m) .
And, among the Romans ,
the lex Cornelia
de sicariis , punished the false witness with
death ,
as
being guilty of a species
of assassination (n).
And there is no doubt but
this
is equally murder in foro
conscientiæ
as killing
with a sword ; though
the modern
law (to avoid the danger of deterring witnesses from giving
evidence
upon capital
prosecutions , if it must be at the
peril of their own lives ) has not yet punished it as such .
If a man does
an act of which
the
consequence
may
probably
be , and eventually is , death ; such killing may
be murder , although
no stroke
be struck by himself, and
no killing
were primarily intended :
as was the
case of
the unnatural
son, who exposed
his sick father to the air ,
against his will, by
reason
whereof he died (o) ;
of the
harlot , who laid
her child under
leaves in an orchard ,
where a kite struck it and killed it (p) ; and of the parish
officers , who shifted
a child
from
parish to parish , till it
died for want of care and sustenance (7) .
And if a master
refuse
his apprentice
necessary
food , or treat him with
for the bishop of Rochester's family,
and for the poor of the parish ; and
the said John Roose was by a retro-
spective
clause of the same statute
ordered to be boiled to death . Lord
Coke mentions
several
instances of
persons suffering
this punishment .

such harshness and
severity , that his
death
is thereby
occasioned, the law will imply malice , and the offence will
be murder (r).
So , too , if a man hath a beast that is used
to do mischief ; and he, knowing it , suffers it to go abroad ,
and it kills
a man ;
even this is manslaughter
in the
owner (s) : but if he had purposely turned it loose , though
barely to frighten
people, and make what is called sport,
it is as much murder , as if he had incited
a bear or dog to
worry them (t).
Further ; the person
killed
must
be " a reasonable
creature in being , and under
the king's peace ," at the
time of the killing .
Therefore to kill an alien , is as much
murder
as to kill the most regular born Englishman.
To
kill a child in its mother's womb , although
a felony ( u) , is
no murder ; but if the child
be
born
alive , and
die by
reason of the potion or bruises it received in the womb , it
may be murder in the wrongdoer (x) .
And with regard
to child-murder , a crime common and difficult of detection ,
it is especially enacted
that , " If any woman shall be deli
vered of a child , every person who shall , by any
secret
disposition of the dead body of the
said child , whether
such child died
before , at , or after its birth, endeavour to
conceal the birth thereof , shall
be guilty
of
a misde
meanor " (y). " Provided that if any person tried for the
murder of any child shall
be acquitted thereof, it shall
be
lawful for the jury by whose verdict such person shall
be
acquitted , to find , in case it shall
so appear in evidence ,
that
the child
had recently
been
born , and
that
such
person did , by some
secret disposition of the dead body
of such child , endeavour to conceal the birth thereof , and
thereupon the
court
may pass such sentence
as if such

person
had been convicted
upon
an indictment
for the
concealment
of the birth " (x).
Lastly , the killing
must be committed " with malice
aforethought ," to make it the crime of murder .
This is
the grand criterion which distinguishes
murder from other
killing
and this
malice prepense malitia
præcogitata , is
not so properly spite or malevolence to the
deceased
in
particular, as any evil design in general ; the dictate of a
wicked , depraved, and malignant
heart (a) ; un disposition
àfaire un male chose (b) ; and it may be either express or
implied in law.
Express
malice
is
when
one , with
a
sedate ,
deliberate
mind
and
formed
design ,
doth kill
another
which formed
design
is
evidenced
by external
circumstances
discovering that inward intention
; as lying
in wait, antecedent menaces ,
former
grudges , and con
certed
schemes
to do him
some bodily
harm (c) .
This
takes in the case of deliberate duelling , the principals
and
seconds in which
are, if the duel terminate fatally, alike
guilty of murder (d) .
Also , if even upon
a
sudden
provocation
one beats
another in a cruel and unusual
manner , so that
he dies ,
though the aggressor
did not intend to cause
death , yet
he is guilty of murder
by express malice ; that is , by an
express evil design , the genuine
sense
of malitia .
As
when a park-keeper tied a boy , who was stealing wood , to
a horse's
tail , and dragged him along the park ; when a
master
corrected
his
servant with an iron bar ;
and
a
schoolmaster stamped on his scholar's belly ; so that each
of the sufferers
died ; these were justly held to be murders ,
because
the correction being
excessive, and such as could
not proceed but from a bad heart , it was equivalent to a
deliberate act of slaughter (e) .
Neither
shall
he be guilty

of a less crime , who kills another in
consequence
of such
a wilful act, as shows him to be an enemy to all mankind
in general ;
as going
deliberately , and with
an intent to
do mischief (ƒ) , upon a horse
used to kick , or coolly dis
charging
a gun among a multitude
of people (g).
So if a
man resolves to kill the next man he meets , and does kill
him, this is murder , although he knew him not ; for there
is evidence of universal malice .
And , if two or more come
together to do an unlawful
act against the king's peace , of
which the probable
consequence
might be bloodshed , as
to beat a man , to commit
a riot , or to rob a park : and
one of them
kills
a man ;
it is
murder
in
them all,
because
of the unlawful
act , the malitia præcogitata , or
evil intended beforehand ( ).
Also in many cases where no malice is expressed , the
law will imply it :
as
where
a man
wilfully
poisons
another , in such a deliberate act the law presumes malice ,
though no particular
enmity can be proved ( ) . If a pri
soner, by duress of his gaoler , comes to an untimely
end ,
this is murder .
Nor, in order to constitute
such duress ,
is it necessary that wounds be actually inflicted . And the
reason why malice is here implied
is this , the gaoler
has
been guilty of a breach of his duty , of the trust reposed in
him by law , which requires , not that
a prisoner
shall be
punished in gaol , but that he shall
be safely kept .
The
act, moreover , was
done
deliberately , and
therefore
of
malice prepense ( ). And if a man kills another suddenly ,
without
any , or without
a considerable
provocation , the
law implies malice ; for no person , unless of an abandoned
heart , would be guilty of such an act, upon a slight or no
apparent cause ( ) .
No affront , by words or gestures only,
is a sufficient
provocation ,
so as
to
excuse
or extenuate

such acts of violence
as manifestly
endanger the life of
another (m).
But if the person
so
provoked
had unfor
tunately killed the other , by beating him in such a manner
as showed only an intent
to chastise and not to kill him ,
the law so far considers the provocation of contumelious
behaviour ,
as
to
adjudge
it
manslaughter ,
and
not
murder
(n).
In like
manner if one kills
an
officer of
justice (0) , either civil or criminal , in the execution of his
duty , or any of his
assistants
endeavouring to conserve
the peace, or any private person endeavouring to suppress
an affray or apprehend
a felon , knowing
his authority
or
the intention with which he interposes , the law will imply
malice , and the killer shall be guilty of murder (p) .
And
if one intends to do some other felony , and undesignedly
kills a man , this
also is murder (9).
Thus , if one shoots
at A and misses him , but kills B, this is murder ; because
of the previous
felonious
intent , which
the law transfers
from one to the other .
The same is the case where one
lays poison for A ; and B, against whom the prisoner had
no malicious intent , takes it, and it kills him ; this likewise
is murder (r) .
So also , if one gives a woman with child
a medicine to procure abortion , and it operates
so violently
as to kill the
woman , this is murder in the person who
gave it (s). It were endless
to go through all the cases of
homicide , which
have been
adjudged
either expressly , or
impliedly malicious : these , therefore, may suffice
as spe
cimens , and we may take it for a general
rule
that
all
homicide
is malicious , and of course amounts to murder ,
unless
where justified
by the command
or permission of
the law ;
excused
on the
account
of accident
or self
preservation ; or alleviated
into
manslaughter , by being
either the involuntary
consequence
of some act, not strictly

violent
provocation .
And
circumstances
of
justification
,
excuse , or alleviation , it is
incumbent
upon
the prisoner to make out , to the satisfaction of the court
and jury
the latter of whom
are to decide
whether
the
circumstances alleged are proved to have actually existed ;
the former , how far they extend to take away or mitigate
the guilt .
For all homicide is presumed to be malicious ,
until the contrary appears upon the evidence
(t) .
It will not of course be supposed that counsel for the
prosecution
on a charge of murder
should rely merely
upon the operation
against the accused
of the presump
tion stated, and
so restrict
himself to establishing
the
bare fact of homicide .
It is the duty of counsel
on a
criminal
prosecution ,
especially in a case
so
serious
as
supposed, fully and fairly to set forth the facts which can
be
proved ,
neither
extenuating
them
nor
yet
unduly
pressing them
against the prisoner , or colouring them to
ensure conviction .
Justice
is , in such a case , best satis
fied where the
opening
statement of counsel is calm and
unimpassioned , and where the evidence against the accused
is frankly and freely submitted , without embellishment
, to
the court and jury (u).

that the defendant
did
" feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , kill
and murder" the
deceased
; and an indictment
for man
slaughter charges that the defendant did
“ feloniously kill
and slay " the deceased (x). And upon an indictment for the
more serious of these offences
the jury may , if so minded ,
return a verdict that the accused
is guilty of manslaugh
ter(y).
Such an indictment lies and is triable in our courts
for murder
or manslaughter , committed
by a subject of
the crown on land
out of the United Kingdom , whether
or
not within
the
Queen's
dominions , and whether
the
person killed were a
subject of her
majesty
or not (~).
And where a person , being feloniously
stricken , poisoned
,
or otherwise
hurt upon the
sea , or at any place out of
England ,
dies
of
such
stroke ,
poisoning ,
or hurt
in
England ,
or
being
feloniously
stricken ,
poisoned ,
or
otherwise
hurt at any
place in
England , dies of
such
stroke, poisoning , or hurt upon the sea , or at any place
out of England, every
offence
committed
in
respect of
any such case , whether the same amount to the offence of
murder
or of manslaughter , may
be tried , and
punished
in the county
or place in England in which such death ,
stroke ,
poisoning ,
or hurt may
have happened ,
in
the
same manner
as if such
offence
had been wholly com
mitted in that county or place (a).
A bill of indictment
for
felonious
homicide
may be
preferred at any time , no matter
how long
the
interval ,
after commission
of the offence ; but where the charge is
of this nature our law deems it safer in favorem vitæ , that
the period elapsing between
the death and its cause should
be restricted within reasonable and definite limits , for it
may not be easy to connect with certainty cause and effect
after a long interval of time .
Accordingly
no person shall
be adjudged by any act whatever to have killed another , if
that other does not die within a year and

light , being
an atrocious
breach of the
peace ,
and tending to deprive the sovereign of the aid and assist-
ance of his subjects .
For mayhem is properly defined to
be the violently depriving
another of the use of such of
his members as may render him the less able in fighting,
either
to defend himself, or to annoy his adversary (s) .
And therefore , the cutting off, or disabling , or weakening
a man's
hand
or finger , or striking out his
eye or fore-
tooth , or depriving
him of those parts the loss of which
in all animals
abates
their
courage, are held to be may-
hems .
But the cutting off his ear , or nose , or the like, is
not held to be mayhem at common law ; because
this does
not weaken , but only disfigures him.
By the ancient
law of England
, he who maimed

man , whereby he lost any part of his body , was sentenced
to lose the like part ;
membrum
pro
membro (t).
But
this went afterwards out of use : partly because the law of
retaliation , as was formerly
shown (u), is at best an in-
adequate
rule of punishment
; and partly because
upon a
repetition
of the
offence , the
punishment
could
not be
repeated.
So that, by the common law, as it for a long
time stood , mayhem was only punishable with fine
and
imprisonment
(x) ; unless , perhaps , the
offence
of may-
hem by castration , which
all our old writers
held
to be
felony
"et sequitur aliquando pona
capitalis , aliquando
perpetuum exilium , cum omnium
bonorum
ademptione " (y).
But subsequent statutes put the crime and punishment
of mayhem
more out of doubt .
For first, by statute
5
Hen. 4 , c. 5 , to remedy a mischief
that then prevailed
of
beating , wounding , or robbing
a man , and then
cutting
out his tongue , or putting
out his
eyes , to prevent him
from giving
evidence against the offender, this
offence
was
declared to
be felony , if done
of malice
prepense ;
that
is , as sir Edward
Coke (2) explains it, voluntarily,
and of set purpose , though
done upon a sudden occasion .
Next, in order of time , was the statute 37 Hen. 8 , c. 6,
which directed that if a man should
maliciously
and un-
lawfully cut off the ear of any of the king's subjects , he
should not only forfeit treble damages
to the party grieved ,
to be recovered by action of trespass at common law, as a
civil satisfaction
; but also 107. by way of fine to the king,
which
was
his criminal amercement .
By far the most
severe and effectual , however, of former
statutes for the
repression of mayhem was the 22 & 23 Car . 2, c.
1 , called
the Coventry
act ; being
occasioned
by an assault on sir
John
Coventry in the
street, and slitting his nose , in

revenge
(as
was
supposed)
for
some obnoxious
words
uttered by him in
parliament .
By this
statute it was
enacted , that if any person should of malice aforethought ,
and by lying in wait , unlawfully cut out or disable the
tongue, put out an eye , slit the nose , cut off a nose or lip,
or cut off or
disable
any limb or member of any
other
person
with intent to maim
or to disfigure
him ;
such
person , his
counsellors , aiders , and abettors , should
be
guilty of felony (a).
Offences involving or akin to mayhem are now punish
able under various
sections of the 24 & 25 Vict . c. 100 ,
constituting each of the undermentioned
acts if done " un
lawfully and maliciously " (b) , a felony:
1. The preventing
or impeding
any person ,
being
on
board of or having
quitted
any ship or vessel in distress ,
or wrecked , stranded , or cast on shore, in his
endeavour
to save
his
life , or preventing
or impeding
any person in
(a) On this statute
Mr. Coke , a
gentleman
of
Suffolk ,
and
one
Woodburn,
a
labourer ,
were in
dicted in 1722 ; Coke for hiring and
abetting
Woodburn , and Woodburn
for the
actual
fact
of slitting the
nose of Mr.
Crispe , Coke's brother
in -law.
The
case was
somewhat
singular.
The
murder
of
Crispe
was
intended , and
he was left for
dead, being terribly hacked and dis
figured
with
a hedge -bill ; but he
recovered .
Now the bare intent
to
murder
was no felony
; but to dis
figure , with an intent to
disfigure ,
was
made
so by this statute ; on
which they were therefore indicted .
And
Coke , who
was
a disgrace
to
the profession
of the law, had the
effrontery
to rest his defence upon
this point , that the assault was not
committed
with
an intent
to dis
figure , but with an intent to
mur
der
and
therefore
not within the
:
VOL. IV.
statute .
But the
court held , that
if a man attacks another to murder
him with such
an instrument
as a
hedge -bill , which
cannot
but
en
danger the disfiguring
him ; and in
such attack happens not to kill , but
only to disfigure him : he might be
indicted
on this
statute ;
and it
should be left to the jury to deter
mine whether it were not a design
to murder
by disfiguring , and
con
sequently
a malicious
intent
to dis
figure
as well as to murder .
Ac
cordingly
the
jury
found
the
accused guilty of a previous
intent
to
disfigure , in order to effect their
principal
intent
to
murder , and
they were both
condemned and exe
cuted .

guage as " causing or tending
to cause
danger to life or
bodily
harm ,"
next
in order to the foregoing
offences ,
assaults will claim our attention .
V. With regard
to the nature of an assault , I have
little to add to what
has already
been observed in the
preceding
book of these Commentaries
; when
we
con
sidered it as a private
wrong , or civil injury, for which a
satisfaction
or remedy is given
to
the party
aggrieved .
Taken
in
a public
light ,
as
a breach of the
peace ,
an
affront to the government , and a damage done
to the
subjects of the
crown ; an
assault is
also indictable
and
punishable .
It is an attempt to commit a battery , or an
act indicating
an intention to do violence to the person of
another , as by pointing
a gun at him , within a distance
to
which it will carry , striking at him or the like (≈),
A
battery includes not only beating and wounding , but even
the touching or laying hold of another's person or clothes
in an angry or hostile manner (a) .
There are some species of battery , more penal than the
rest , such as the beating of a clerk in orders , on account
of the respect and
reverence
due to his sacred
character
as the
minister
and
ambassador of
peace
;
and
it
is
accordingly
enacted
by the
statute , 24
&
25 Vict . c.
100 ,
s.
36 , that, whosoever
shall , by threats
or force ,
obstruct
or prevent , or
endeavour
to
obstruct
or pre
vent , any clergyman
or other minister in or from
cele
brating divine
service,
or otherwise
officiating
in
any
church ,
chapel , or place of divine
worship , or in or from
the performance of his duty in the lawful burial of the
dead
in any
churchyard
or other burial place ,
or shall
strike
or
offer any violence
to , or
shall , upon
any civil
process , or
under
the
pretence of executing
any
civil
process, arrest any clergyman
or other minister

in , or, to the knowledge of the offender , is about

of kidnapping

the
forcible

away of a man , woman , or

was capital by the Jewish law. "He that stealeth a man ,

So likewise
in the
civil
law,
the
offence
of spiriting
away
and
stealing
men
and children , which was called plagium , and the offenders
plagiarii
was punished with death (t) .
This is unques

subjects, banishes
a man from
his
country , and may in

the

law of
England has punished it with fine , and imprisonment

the
offence of deserting

has
been
specially provided for

Falling within the class of offences
under
our
notice
may be specified the following , of which
the first men
tioned is a felony , and the second
a misdemeanor :
.1 . The unlawfully, either by force or fraud , taking or

away, or detaining

This
by the Jewish law

was punished
with

,
in
case
the damsel was betrothed

and
in
case she
was not betrothed
,
then
a
heavy fine
of
fifty shekels was
to
be paid
to
the damsel's
father
,

be the
wife
of
the ravisher all the days
of
his life
;
without that
power
of
divorce
,
which was
in

Mosaic law

The civil law
(d)
punished
with death and
confisca-

of
goods the crime
of
ravishment
:
under
which
it
included the offence of forcible abduction
,

the emperor's edict , whether she consented or was forced :
"sive
volentibus , sive
nolentibus , mulieribus ,
tale facinus
fuerit perpetratum
."
And
this , in
order to take
away
every opportunity of offending
in this way from women
whom the Roman law supposed never to go astray , with-
out the seduction
and arts of the other sex : and therefore ,
by restraining
and making so highly penal the
solicita-
tions of the
men , they
meant
to
secure
effectually
the
honour of the women . " Si enim ipsi raptores metu , vel
atrocitate pœnæ , ab hujusmodifacinore se temperaverint, nulli
mulieri, sive volenti , sive nolenti, peccandi locus relinquetur ;
quia hoc ipsum velle mulierum , ab insidiis
nequissimi homi-
nis, qui meditatur
rapinam , inducitur .
Nisi
etenim
eam
solicitaverit , nisi odiosis
artibus
circumvenerit
, non faciet
eam
velle in tantum
dedecus
sese prodere ."
But our
English law does
not entertain
quite such sublime ideas
of the
honour
of either
sex,
as
to lay the
blame of a
mutual
fault upon
one of the
transgressors
only :
and
therefore makes it a necessary
ingredient
in the crime of
rape , that it be against the woman's will (e).
Rape
was
punished
by the
Saxon
laws , particularly
those of King Athelstan (f), with death : which was also
agreeable
to the
old
Gothic
or
Scandinavian
constitu-
tion (g) .
But this was afterwards thought too hard
and
in
its
stead another
severe
but
not capital
punishment
was inflicted
by William
the Conqueror
;
viz
.
castration
and
loss
of
eyes
(h)
;
which continued
till after
Bracton
wrote
,
in
the reign
of
Henry the Third
.
But
in
order
to
prevent
malicious
accusations
,
it
was then the law
,
that
the woman should immediately
after
,
"
dum recens fuerit
maleficium
,"
go
to
the
next
town
,

make dis-

stable of the hundred , the coroners , and the sheriff with
the outrage ( ?) ; though
afterwards , by statute Westm .
1 ,
c. 13 , the time of limitation in England was extended
to
forty days.
At
present
there is no time of limitation
fixed
for, as rape is usually
now punished on indictment
at the suit of the crown , the maxim of law takes place ,
that
nullum tempus occurrit regi : but
the jury will rarely
give
credit
to
a
stale
complaint .
During the former
period
also , it was held
for law (k), that
the woman
(by
consent of the judge and her
parents ) might redeem the
offender from the execution of his sentence , by accepting
him for her
husband ; if he also was willing
to agree to
the exchange , but not otherwise .
In the
3 Edw .
1 , by the
statute Westm.
1 , c. 13 , the
punishment
of rape
was
much
mitigated ;
the
offence
itself of ravishing
a damsel within twelve
years of age ,
either with her consent or without , or of any other woman
against her will, being reduced to a trespass , if not prose-
cuted by appeal within forty
days ,
and
subjecting
the
offender only to two years ' imprisonment
, and
a fine
at
the king's will .
But this
lenity being
productive of bad
consequences
, it was ten years afterwards , in 13 Edw .
1,
deemed
necessary to make the offence of forcible
rape
felony by statute Westm. 2 , c.
34.
And by statute
18
Eliz . c. 7 , it was made felony without benefit of clergy .
Rape
continued to be punishable
with death until the
year 1841 (1) , when
for the capital punishment
was
sub-
stituted transportation
, and now the 24 & 25 Vict. c. 100 ,
s. 48 ,
enacts
that, whosoever shall be convicted
of the
crime of rape, shall
be guilty of felony , and liable to be
kept in penal
servitude for life, or for any term not less
than five (m) years , or to be imprisoned
for any term not
exceeding two years , with or without
hard labour .

sumed by law physically
incapable of committing
a rape ,
and
therefore cannot be found guilty of it.
For
though
in some cases
malitia
supplet
ætatem , yet , as to this par
ticular
species of felony , the law supposes
an imbecility of
body as well as mind (n) .
The civil law seems
to suppose a prostitute or common
harlot
incapable
of any injuries
of this kind (0) :
not
allowing any punishment
for violating
the chastity of her ,
who has
indeed
no chastity
at all ,
or at least has
no
regard to it .
But the law of England does
not judge
so
hardly of offenders
, as to cut off all opportunity
of retreat
even from common strumpets , and to treat them as never
capable of amendment .
It therefore holds it to be felony
to force even a concubine or harlot ; because
the woman
may have forsaken that unlawful
course of life ( p) ; and ,
as Bracton well
observes (q) , " licet
meretrix fuerit antea ,
certe tunc temporis non fuit , cum reclamando
nequitice ejus
consentire noluit."
As to the material facts requisite to be given in evidence
and proved upon an indictment
of rape, they are of such
a nature , that though necessary to be known and settled ,
for the conviction
of the guilty and preservation of the
innocent, and therefore to be found in such criminal
trea
tises
as
discourse of these
matters in detail , yet they
ought not to be publicly discussed ,
except in
a court of
justice. I shall therefore merely add upon this
head
a
few remarks
from sir Matthew
Hale, with regard to the
competency and credibility
of witnesses , which may , salvo
pudore , be considered .
And , first , the party
ravished may give
evidence
upon
oath , and is in law a competent witness ; but the credi
bility of her testimony , and how far forth she is to be
believed , must
be left to the jury upon the circumstances
of fact that concur in that
testimony .
For instance : if

the witness
be of good fame (r) ; if she
presently
dis
covered
the offence (s) , and made search
for the offender ;
if the party
accused
fled for it ;
these
and the like
are
concurring
circumstances which
give greater probability
to her evidence.
But , on the other side , if she be of evil
fame, and stand unsupported by others ; if she concealed
the injury
for any considerable
time
after
she had op
portunity to complain
; if the place , where the fact was
alleged to be committed , was where it was possible
she
might have been
heard , and she made no outcry ; these
and the like
circumstances
carry
a strong
though
not
conclusive ,
presumption
that
her
testimony
is
false
or
feigned .
Moreover , if the rape were committed on an infant she
may still be a competent
witness , if she has
sense
and
understanding
enough to know the nature and obligations
of an oath ; or even to be sensible of the wickedness of
telling a deliberate
lie (t).
But no hearsay evidence can
be given of the declarations of a child who has not capa
city to be sworn , nor can such child be examined in court
without oath (u) ;
and there
is no determinate
age, at
which the oath of a child
ought
either to be admitted
or
rejected
.
Yet , where the evidence
of children is admitted ,
it is much to be wished , in order to render their
evidence
credible , that there should be some
concurrent testimony
of time , place, and circumstances , in order to make
out
the fact deposed
to ; and that the conviction
should

be grounded
singly on the unsupported
accusation of an
infant under years of discretion .
There may be therefore ,
in many cases of this nature , witnesses who are competent ,
that is, who may be admitted to be heard ; and yet , after
being heard, may prove not to be credible , or such as the
jury is bound to believe.
For
one
excellence of the trial
by jury is,
that
the jury
are triers of the credit of the
witnesses , as well as of the truth of the fact.
" It is true," says a learned judge (x) , " that rape is a
most
detestable
crime , and therefore
ought severely and
impartially
to be punished ; but it must be remembered
that it is an accusation easy to be made, hard to be proved ,
but harder to be defended by the party
accused , though
innocent." He then relates two extraordinary
cases of mali
cious prosecution for this crime , that had happened within
his own observation ; and concludes thus : " I mention these
instances , that we may be the more cautious upon
trials
of offences
of this nature , wherein the court and jury may
with so much
ease be imposed
upon , without great care
and vigilance ; the heinousness of the offence many times
transporting
the judge and jury with so much indignation ,
that they are over hastily
carried to the conviction of the
person
accused
thereof , by the
confident
testimony of
sometimes false and malicious witnesses ."

woman , or in which
she shall have any such interest , or
which shall come to her as such heiress , coheiress
, or next
of kin as aforesaid ; and if any such marriage as aforesaid
shall have taken
place , such property
shall , upon
such
conviction, be settled in such
manner
as the
Court of
Chancery
shall upon information
at suit of the attorney-
general appoint .
An indictment
framed upon the above
enactment must
allege that the taking
was for lucre , but the motive may
be presumed from the interest mentioned in the indictment .
It must appear that the woman was taken away against
her will .
And though possibly the marriage or defilement
might be by her subsequent consent , being won thereunto
by flatteries after the taking , yet this is felony , if the first
taking
were against
her will ; and
so
vice
versa , if the
woman be originally taken away with her
own
consent ,
yet if she afterwards refuse to continue with the offender,
and be forced against
her will , she may from that time as
properly be said
to be taken
against
her will , as if she
never had given any consent at all ; for till the force was
put upon her , she was in her own power (e) .
A woman ,
thus taken
away and married , may be sworn
and give
evidence
against
the offender , though he is her husband
de facto; contrary to the general rule of law ; because
he
is no husband
de jure , in case the
actual
marriage was
also
against
her will.
Lastly ,
the intent laid in the
indictment may be proved by the acts
or
declarations of
the defendant ,
or may
be inferred
from
other circum-
stances (f).
Another
offence, differing
from
the above, is that of
forcibly
taking
away
or detaining

her will , a

her to be married
or carnally

any other person ; this is a felony , and punishable
as below
mentioned (g).
The attempting by injurious
means to procure abortion
is likewise criminal
and indictable , for it is enacted :
1. That any woman , being with child , who , with intent
to procure her own
miscarriage , shall unlawfully admi

cause to be taken
by her
any
poison
or other
noxious

a still
deeper
malignity ;
the
infamous
crime
against
nature , committed
either with man
or
beast .
A crime
which
ought to be strictly
and impartially proved , and
then
as
strictly
and impartially
punished .
But it is
an
offence
of so dark a nature ,
so easily
charged ,
and
the negative
so difficult to be proved , that the accusation
should
be clearly
made out : for, if false , it deserves
a
punishment
inferior only to that of the crime itself.
I will not act so disagreeable a part, to my readers as
well as myself , as to dwell upon
a subject , the very men
tion of which is a disgrace to
human
nature .
It will
be more eligible
to imitate
in this
respect the delicacy of
our English law, which
treats it , in its very indictments ,
as a crime not
fit
to
be
named
;
"
peccatum illud horribile
,
inter
christianos
non
nominandum

ancient

such
miscreants

to
death
;
though
Fleta
says they should
be
buried
alive
;
either
of
which punishments was indifferently
used
for this crime among the ancient Goths

But the penalty assigned

it

is
now penal

CHAPTER
XIV .
OFFENCES
AGAINST
PROPERTY .
OFFENCES
against the property of individuals
, like those
directed against the person , are now mainly
indicated and
made punishable
by statute (a) , recourse , however , being
still needed , in respect of matters about which the legisla
ture has been silent , to the customary law. In the offences
here to be considered the principal
ingredients
are malice
and fraud , often accompanied by force.
Proof that an act
was done maliciously or fraudulently
has been much facili
tated by various statutory provisions which will from time
to time be specified in notis .
Offences falling within the
scope of this chapter will be treated of in the following
order : the maliciously
setting fire to buildings
and other
things , burglary
and housebreaking , simple , aggravated ,
and compound
larceny ,
embezzlement , fraud , and false
(a) The statutes principally cited
throughout
this chapter
are :--the
act concerning
malicious
injuries
to
property
(24 & 25 Vict . c. 97) ; the
act
concerning
larceny
and
other
similar
offences
(24
&
25 Vict .
c. 96) ; and the act concerning
for
gery (24 & 25 Viet. c. 98).
By ss. 73, 117, and
51 respec
tively of the above
statutes , it is
enacted
that when
any person
has
been convicted of an indictable mis
demeanor
under
either
act,
the
court may , in addition
to or in lieu
of any of the punishments
thereby
authorised ,
fine
the
offender , and
require him to
enter
into
his
own
recognizances
and
to
find suretics ,
both
or
either ,
for
keeping
the
peace and being of good behaviour
;
and in
case of any
felony
punish
able under such act , the court
may
require
the offender
to
enter into
his own recognizances ,
and to find
sureties , both or either , for keeping
the peace, in addition
to any punish
inent
authorised
by it :
provided
that no
person be thus imprisoned
for not finding
sureties
for
any
period exceeding
one year .


264
OFFENCES
AGAINST
PROPERTY ,
I. Arson.
pretences, forgery , malicious injuries
to property not pre
viously noticed , and conspiracy to commit certain crimes.
I.
Arson (b) is , at
common
law,
the
malicious
and
wilful burning of the house or out-house of another man .
This is an act of very great malignity : because , first , it is
an
offence
against
that
right
of habitation ,
which
is
acquired by the law of nature
as well
as by the laws of
society : next , because
of the terror
and confusion
that
necessarily attend it : and, lastly , because
it wastes the
substance of the community - in simple theft , of which
we shall
hereafter
speak , the thing stolen only
changes
its master , but still remains in esse
for the benefit of the
public , whereas by burning
the thing
itself is absolutely
destroyed .
This crime may also be more destructive than
murder
itself : since murder ,
atrocious
as it is , seldom
extends beyond the felonious
act designed ; whereas fire
may involve in a common
calamity persons unknown to
the incendiary ,
and not intended
to be hurt by him
friends
as well as enemies.
For which
reason
the civil
law (c) punished with death such as maliciously
set fire
to houses in towns , and contiguous
to others ; but was
more merciful
to such as
only fired
a cottage , or house ,
standing by itself.
Our
customary
law
distinguished
with
much
nicety
upon this crime , holding
that not only the bare dwelling
house, but all out-houses
parcel thereof , though
not
con
tiguous
thereto , nor under
the same roof ,
as barns and
stables , might be the subject of arson (d).
The common
law also accounted it felony to burn a single
barn in the
field , if filled with hay or corn , though
not
parcel of the
dwelling-house (e).
And many distinctions
are to be met
with in our books , concerning what
would
or would
not
amount
to arson ;
cases
such
as alluded
to,
seem
now,
however , to be rendered almost
useless
by various provi

of the
words " wilfully

,"
see R. v. Farrington, Russ . & Ry.
207 , decided under
the
43 Geo. 3,
c.
58, which
made
felonious
the
" wilfully , maliciously , and unlaw
fully setting
fire to any mill , with
intent
to
injure or
defraud
any
one ."
There , at the trial , the
case
had been in other respects
satisfac
torily proved against
the
prisoner
;
but no
evidence had been adduced
to show that his intent was such as
specified
in the act , and
sentence
was
respited
until
the
opinion
of
the judges
could be taken upon this
question
whether , under
the par
ticular
words of the
statute
above
set out , the intent to injure or de
fraud
some person
was
not
neces
sary to be proved , or at least
some
fact from which such intent could
be inferred , beyond the mere act of
setting the mill
on
fire ? It was
held that
the intent
specified
need
not
otherwise
be
proved , because
a person who
does an act wilfully
necessarily
intends
that which
must
be the consequence
of the act, and
in the
case put
the
accused
had
therefore in legal contemplation
in
tended
to injure
the
owner of the
premises
which were
burned .
R.
v.
Farrington
accordingly
shows
that if proof
be given
that
an act
such as there in question
was done
wilfully , and
not
done
under
cir
cumstances which would
excuse or
justify it, such proof will substan
tiate an allegation
of malice
and of
an intent to injure .
We may add
that
by sect . 58 of the stat . 24 &
25 Vict . c. 97,
every
punishment
and
forfeiture
by that act imposed
on any person
maliciously
commit
ting an offence punishable
upon in
dictment
or upon summary convic
tion , shall
equally
apply and be en
forced , whether
the offence be com
mitted
from
malice
conceived
against the owner of the property in
respect of which it be committed
or
otherwise . See R. v. Salmon , Russ .
& Ry. 26.

such as above -mentioned (1) .
As to what was said to be a burning , so as to amount
to arson, a bare intent , or attempt to do it, by
actually
setting
fire to a house, unless it absolutely
burned , was
held not to fall within the description of incendit
et com
bussit ; which were words
necessary
, in the days of law
latin , to all
indictments
of this
sort .
But the burning
and
consuming
of any part of a
dwelling -house
was
accounted
sufficient , though the fire were afterwards ex
tinguished (m) , to satisfy the allegation .
Any such ques
tion is now , however , less likely than formerly
to arise ,
inasmuch
as the
24 & 25 Vict.

97 ,
enacts , that the

the unlawfully and

Such

malicious
injuries
to property
analogous
to arson which
are indictable
and punishable
under the
statute law .
III. Burglary , or nocturnal
housebreaking , burgi latro
cinium, which by our ancient law was called hamesecken ,
as it is in Scotland
to this day, has always been looked
upon
as a very heinous
offence
: not only
because
of the
abundant
terror
which it naturally
carries with it , but
also as it is
a forcible
invasion
and disturbance
of that
right of habitation
which
every individual
might acquire
even in a state of nature ; an invasion , which in such a
state would be sure to be punished with
death , unless
the
assailant
were the
stronger .
But in
civil
society , the
laws come in to the assistance of the weaker party ;
and ,
besides that they leave him this
natural right of killing
the
aggressor, if he
can (as
was
shown in a former
chapter (h) ) , they
also protect
and avenge him, in
case
the might of the assailant
is too powerful .
And the law
of England has
so particular
and tender a regard to the
immunity of a man's house, that it styles it his castle , and
will never suffer it to be violated with impunity
; agreeing
herein with the sentiments of ancient Rome , as expressed
in the words of Tully (2) ; " quid enim
sanctius, quid omni
religione
munitius , quam
domus
uniuscujusque
civium?”
For this
reason
no
outward
doors
can in general
be
broken
open to
execute
any civil
process
;
though , in
criminal
causes , the public
safety supersedes
the private.

BURGLARY .

Hence
also in part
arises
the animadversion
of the law
upon nuisancers
and incendiaries : and to this principle it
must be assigned , that a man may assemble people toge-
ther lawfully (at least if they do not
exceed
eleven ) with-
out danger of raising
a riot, rout , or unlawful assembly ,
in order to protect and defend his house ; which
he is not
permitted to do in any other case (k).
The definition
of a burglar ,
as given by sir
Edward
Coke (1) , is " he that by night breaketh and entereth into
a mansion -house , with intent
to commit
a felony ."
In
this definition there are four things
to be considered ; the
time , the place, the manner , and the intent.
The time must be by night, and not by day : for in the
daytime there is no burglary .
We have
seen (m) , in the
case of justifiable homicide , how much more heinous all
laws made an attack by night than by day ; allowing
the
party attacked
by night to kill
the assailant
with im-
punity.
As to what is reckoned night, and what day, for
this purpose : anciently
the
day was accounted to begin
only at sun -rising , and to end immediately
upon sun- set ;
though the better opinion was , that if there were daylight
or crepusculum enough , begun or left, to discern a man's
face withal , it was no burglary (n).
But all questions as to
what constitutes
the night ,' for the purpose of burglary
,
were
set at rest by statute , and now the 24 & 25 Vict .
c. 96, enacts (section
1) that for the purposes of the act,
which inter alia prescribes the punishment for burglary (0) ,
the night shall be deemed
to commence at nine o'clock in
the evening , and to conclude at six o'clock in the morning
of the next succeeding day.
As to the place wherein
burglary
can be committed , it
must , at common
law, according
to sir Edward
Coke's
definition , be in a mansion -house (p) : and therefore

account for the
reason why breaking
open a church
is
burglary , by the
common law, he quaintly
observes
that
it is domus mansionalis Dei (q).
But burglary
might also
have been committed by breaking
the gates or walls of a
town in the night (r) ; though
that perhaps Sir Edward
Coke would have called the mansion -house of the garrison
or corporation .
Spelman defines burglary to be, " nocturna
diruptio
alicujus
habitaculi ,
vel
ecclesiæ , etiam
murorum
portarumve
burgi ,
ad feloniam
perpetrandam ."
And
therefore we may safely conclude that the words
domus
mansionalis
are only requisite in defining at common law
burglary in a private
house : which is the most
frequent
form of this offence .
For no distant barn , warehouse , or
the like, was clothed with the same privileges , nor looked
upon
as a man's
castle of defence : nor is the breaking
open of a house wherein no man resides , and which , there
fore , for the time being is not
a mansion -house, attended
with the same circumstances of midnight terror (s).
A house wherein
a man sometimes resides, and which
the owner has only left for a short season , animo revertendi ,
may be the object of burglary , though
no one be in it at
the time of the fact committed (t) .
The mere casual use ,
however , of a tenement , will
not suffice ; and , therefore
,
the circumstance of a servant sleeping in a barn , or porter
in a warehouse , for particular
and temporary
purposes
,
will not so operate as to make a violent entry in the night ,
in order to steal, a burglary (u).

And

BURGLARY .
273
A chamber in a college or an inn of court , where each
inhabitant has a distinct
property , is , for all purposes , the
mansion -house of the
owner (t).
So also is a room
or
lodging , in any private
house, the
mansion for the time
being of the lodger ; if the owner
does not himself dwell
in the house, or if he and the lodger enter by different out
ward doors .
But if the owner himself sleeps in the house,
and has but one outward door at which he and his lodgers
enter , such lodgers seem only to be inmates , and all their
apartments
to be parcel of the one dwelling -house of the
owner (x) .
Thus too the house of a corporation , inhabited
in separate apartments by the officers of the body corporate,
is the mansion -house of the corporation , and not of the
respective
officers (z) .
But if I hire
a shop ,
parcel of
another
man's
house, and work or trade in it, but
never
sleep there , it is no dwelling -house , nor can burglary
be
committed
therein ; for by the lease it is severed
from the
rest of the house, and therefore is not the dwelling-house
of him who occupies the other part : neither can I be said
to dwell
therein , when I never sleep
there (a ).
Neither
can burglary be committed in a tent or booth erected in a
market or fair ; though the owner may lodge therein ( b) ;
for the law regards
thus highly nothing
but permanent
edifices ; a house or church , the wall or gate of a town ;
and though it may be the choice of the owner to lodge in
so fragile
a tenement ,
yet
his lodging
there no
more
makes it burglary
to break it open , than it would
be to
uncover a tilted waggon under the same circumstances (c).
If a barn ,
stable ,
or
warehouse ,
were
parcel of the
where the owner has never , by him
self or by any of his family, slept
in the house , it is not his dwelling
house , so as to make the breaking
thereof
burglary,
though
he
has
used it for his
meals , and
all the
purposes
of his
business .

same
common
fence (d) ,
though not under the same roof or contiguous , a burglary
might
at common law have been
committed
therein ; for
the capital house was held to protect and privilege
all
its
branches
and
appurtenants
,
if
within
the
curtilage
or
homestall

But now
,
by statute
,
no

be
both
a
breaking

an

a

or window
open , it is his own folly and negligence , and if
a man enters thereby it is
no burglary
: yet , if he after-
wards unlocks
an inner or chamber door , it is so ( ) .
But
to come down a chimney is held
a burglarious
entry ; for
that is as much closed as the nature of things will
per-
mit (k).
So also to knock at the door, and upon opening
it to rush in , with a felonious
intent : or , under pretence
of taking lodgings , to fall upon the landlord
and rob him ;
or to procure a constable to gain
admittance , in order to
search for traitors , and then
to bind the constable
and
rob
the
house ;
all
these
entries
have
been adjudged
burglarious , though
there
was no
actual breaking ;
for
the law will not
suffer itself to be trifled
with by such
evasions , especially under
the cloak of legal
process
(1) .
And
so , if a
servant
opens
and
enters his
master's
chamber -door with a felonious
design
or if any
other
person lodging
in the same
house or in
a public
inn ,
opens and enters another's door, with such evil intent , it
is burglary (m).
Nay, if the
servant conspires with
a
robber , and lets him
into
the
house by night,
this
is
burglary in both (n) ; for the servant is doing an unlawful
act, and the opportunity
afforded him of doing
it with
greater
ease ,
rather
aggravates
than
extenuates
the
guilt (o) .
As for
the entry , any the least
degree
of it,
with any part of the body , or with an instrument
held in
the hand , is sufficient
;
as to
step
over the threshold , to
put a hand or a hook in at a window to draw out goods,

out of the said
dwelling-house in the night, shall
be deemed
guilty of
burglary."
As to the intent ; it is clear , that to constitute bur
glary
the breaking
and entry
must
be with a felonious
intent , otherwise it is only a trespass .
And this is so,
whether such intention
be actually carried into execution ,
or only demonstrated by some attempt
or overt
act, of
which the jury is to judge.
And therefore such a breach
and
entry of a house
as
has been before described , by
night, with intent to commit a robbery , a murder , a rape ,
or any other felony , is burglary ; whether
the thing be
actually
perpetrated
or
not .
Nor
does
it
make
any
difference , whether
the
offence
were felony
at common
law,
or created
so by statute ; since the
statute which
makes
an
offence
felony ,
gives
it incidentally
all
the
properties of a felony at common law (q).
Where no
actual
felony
has been committed
in the
building burglariously
entered , the practice is to
charge
in the indictment
that the intent of the
accused
was to
commit
murder , larceny , or any specific felony , and from
surrounding
circumstances
this
intent
may be inferred .
Where, however , a felony
has actually
been
committed ,
the jury will
infer the intent
to commit it from the
fact (r).
Thus
much

; which

And it is further provided , that any one found by night
armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon
or instru

Larceny
(or theft ) , by contraction
for latrociny , latro

be
distinguished
into three sorts :
simple
larceny (6) , or plain theft unaccompanied
with any
other
atrocious
circumstance ; aggravated
larceny ; and mixed
or
compound
larceny ;
upon
each of which
offences I
shall remark in the order specified .
V. Simple larceny is the felonious taking , and carrying
away, of the
personal
goods
of another
with intent to
deprive the owner permanently
of his
property
therein .
This offence

was formerly
subdivided
into
grand
and
petit
larceny , the stealing of goods above
the
value
of
twelve -pence ,
was
called
grand
larceny
; of goods to
that value ,
or under it, was petit
larceny . Now, however , the distinc
tion between
grand
and petit lar
ceny is
abolished , for " every

be the value
of the

stolen ,
shall be

were established .
How far such an offence
can exist in a
state of nature , where all things
are held to be common ,
is a question that may be solved with very little difficulty .
The disturbance
of any individual
, in the occupation of
what
he
has
seized to his present
use , seems
to be the
only offence
of this kind incident
to
such a state .
But
unquestionably , in social communities ,
when property
is
established , any violation of that property
is subject to be
punished
by the
laws of society.
At
present
we will
examine
the
nature of theft , or simple
larceny ,
as laid
down in the foregoing
definition .
To constitute
larceny there must
be a taking .
This
implies the consent of the owner to be wanting .
There
fore
no delivery
of goods by their owner to the offender,
upon trust, can ground
a larceny at common law.
If A
lends B a horse, and B rides away with it ; or , if I send
goods by a carrier , and he carries
them
away ;
these are
no larcenies at common law (c).
But if the carrier
opens
a bale or pack of goods , or pierces a vessel of wine , and
takes
away part
thereof, or if he carries it to the place
appointed , and afterwards takes away the whole , these
are
larcenies (d) :
for here the animus furandi
is manifest
;
since in the first case he had otherwise no inducement to
open the goods , and in the second the trust was deter
mined , the delivery
having
taken
its
effect .
But
bare
non-delivery will not , of course , be intended to arise from
a felonious design : since that may happen from a variety
of other accidents .
Neither
by the common law was it
larceny in a servant to
run away with the goods com
mitted
to him to keep , but only
a breach of civil trust .
Though if he had not the possession , but
only
the care
and oversight
of the goods , as the butler
of plate ,
the
shepherd of sheep , and the like, the fraudulent
conversion
of them would
be felony at common law (e) .
So if a guest
robs his inn or tavern of a piece of plate , it is larceny :

OFFENCES
AGAINST
PROPERTY .
for he has not the possession delivered to him , but merely
the use(f).
The rule of our customary law, that a taking or tres
pass was needed
as
an ingredient
in larceny , led to many
nice distinctions
(g) , ex. gr. , where a constructive
posses
sion of the thing charged to have been stolen remained in
the owner , its actual possession having
been parted with ,
or where possession of a chattel
had
been
originally ob
tained
by the
accused
under
colour
of a contract , but
nevertheless animo furandi
and in
pursuance of a fraud .
Hence it was
deemed
expedient
by the legislature to
insert in the statute known
as " The Fraudulent Trustees
Act " (20 & 21 Vict . c. 54 ) , a clause (1) designed
to meet
and remove the difficulties
specified ; and this
clause
has
been
reproduced with some amendments in the 24 &
25
Vict. c. 96 , the 3rd section of which
enacts , that “ whoso
ever , being
a bailee of any chattel , money , or
valuable
security ( )
shall
fraudulently
take
or convert
the
same
to his own use or the use of any person other than the
owner thereof, although he shall not break bulk or other
wise determine the bailment , shall
be guilty
of larceny ,
and
may be
convicted
thereof
upon
an indictment
for
larceny ; " but this provision
does
not
extend
to
any
offence punishable
on summary conviction .
There must be not
only a taking , but a carrying
away
to constitute
larceny ;
cepit
et
asportavit
was
the old
law-latin
charging
the
act
in
an
indictment
for this
offence .

place in which
he found them , though the thief does
not
quite
make off with them , is a sufficient
asportation , or
carrying
away.
As if a man be leading
another's
horse
out of a close , and
be
apprehended in the fact ; or if a
guest , stealing
goods
out of an inn, has removed them
from his chamber down stairs : these have been adjudged
sufficient carryings
away , to constitute larceny ( ) .
Or if
a thief, intending
to steal plate , takes it out of a chest in
which it was, and lays it down upon the floor, but is sur
prised
before
he can make his
escape
with it ; this
is
larceny (k).
The taking, and carrying
away, must also be felonious
;
that is, done animo furandi in order that it may
be lar
cenous ( ) .
This requisite ,
besides
excusing
those
who
labour under
incapacities
of mind
or will (of whom
we
spoke sufficiently
at the entrance of this book (m) ) , in

also
mere
trespassers

other
such
petty
offenders if arraigned
upon
a charge of theft .
As if a
servant takes his master's horse without
his knowledge ,
and brings him home
again : if a neighbour
takes an
other's plough
that is left in the field , and uses it upon
his
own
land ,
and then returns it : if, under
colour of
arrear
of rent , where
none is due, I distrain
another's
cattle ,
or
seize
them : all
these
are
trespasses ,
but
no
felonies (n).
And should a servant , contrary to the orders
of
his master , take from his possession any corn or other
food for the purpose of giving the same to his master's
horses, this
would
be no felony , but might subject

ingredient
in

in the intention of

that

tute the offence, if done

offender on summary conviction
to imprisonment
, or the
payment of a penalty (0).
The
ordinary
discovery of a felonious
intent is where
the party
does
the act, charged to be a felony , clandes-
tinely ; or, being
charged with the fact , denies it.
But
this is by no means the only criterion
of criminality : for
in cases that may amount
to larceny the variety
of cir-
cumstances
is so great , and the
complications thereof
so
mingled , that it is impossible
to recount all those which
may
evidence
a
felonious
intent ,
or
animum furandi :
wherefore they must be left to the due and attentive con-
sideration of the court and jury .
A trespass
in regard
to a chattel coupled with a felo-
nious
conversion
of the
chattel whilst
such
trespass
is
continuing , may suffice to constitute larceny (p).
Again ,
if a chattel is found- not
being in the actual
possession
or custody of any
one , and without
any
ostensible
or
visible
owner-the taking and appropriating
of this chattel
by the finder may or may not be felonious .
It will be so
if at the moment of taking the finder of the chattel , rea-
sonably believing
that its
owner
can be
discovered ,
is
minded nevertheless to convert such chattel wholly to his
own use ; it will not be larceny if the finder of the chattel
appropriates it having
reason to think that it has been
really lost (ie. , lost under
such circumstances
that
its
owner cannot be found ) : or if the finder
has reason to
think
that the
chattel
has been abandoned : or if the
finder , having innocently taken it, subsequently forms the
felonious intention or design of retaining it and converting
it to his own use (q) . The first question for ajury in any such
case may therefore be ―did the accused
take the property
under
such circumstances that he would

action of trespass

for
doing
so ,
as
suming that he had no animus furandi ? If trespass would
lie
,
the
next
question for the jury
would
be
had the
accused any animus furandi
?
If
so
,
he would
be
guilty
of
larceny
.
Obviously
it
is
the duty
of
counsel for the
prisoner
on
a
trial for larceny
,
where the fact
of
taking
or
getting into possession the chattel specified
in
the indict
ment
is
distinctly proved
-
to
contend by any hypothesis
which can be
based
upon
the
facts
in
proof
,
that
the
taking was not felonious
-
that
it
occurred through mistake
or
carelessness
,
or
in
assertion of
a
right
,
or
with intent
to
restore the thing taken after
it
had
served
some tem
porary purpose
to
its lawful owner
.
In
order
to
satisfy the definition
of
larceny
at
common
law
,
the felonious
taking
and carrying
away above men
tioned
must be
of
the personal
goods
of
another
:
for
of
things
real
,
or
savouring
of
the
realty
,
larceny
at
common
law cannot be
committed
.
Lands
,
tenements
,
and
hereditaments
(
either corporeal
or
incorporeal
)
can
not
in
their nature be taken
and
carried
away
.
And
of
things
likewise
that
adhere
to
the freehold
,
as
corn
,
grass
,
trees
,
and the like
,
or
lead upon
a
house
,
no larceny
could be committed by the rules
of
the common law
;
but
the severance
of
any such thing
was merely
a
trespass
;
for by
a
subtlety
in
the legal
notions
of
our ancestors
,
it
was regarded
as
parcel
of
the real estate
;
and therefore
,
whilst
it
continued
so
,
could
not by any possibility
be
the
subject
of
theft
,
being
absolutely fixed and immoveable
.
And
if
things
such
as
mentioned were severed
by violence
from the freehold
,
so
as
to
be changed into moveables
;
and
at
the same time
,
by one and the same continued act
,
were carried off by the person who
severed
them
:
they
could not
,
it
was thought
,
be said
to
have been taken from
the
proprietor
,
in
this their
newly
acquired
state of
mobility
(
which was deemed
essential
to
the
nature of
larceny
),
being
never
,
as
such
,
in
the
actual
or
con
structive possession
of
any one
,
but
of
him who committed

the trespass.
The trespasser could
not in strictness
be
said to have taken what at that time were the personal
goods of another , since the very act of taking
was what
turned them into personal goods .
But if the thief severs
chattels
at
one time from the freehold , whereby the tres
pass
is completed , and they
are converted into personal
chattels , in the constructive
possession of him on whose
soil they are left
or laid ; and the thief comes at another
time , when they are so turned
into personalty , and takes
them away ; this is larceny
at common law, and so it is
if the owner , or any one else , has
severed
them (r) .
In virtue , however , of statutory provisions , larceny
may
now be committed of many things
attached to or growing
upon
land
each of the following
offences
being
now a
felony , and punishable
as simple larceny (s) :—
1. The

nearly
the

relating
to real estate
is at common law no felony , but
a trespass merely (d) ;
because
such writings
concern the land , or (according to

Larceny
also could
not
at common law be committed
of animals in which
no right of property
either absolute
or qualified , was recognised ;
as of beasts that
are fere
naturæ, and unreclaimed , such as deer, hares , and conies ,
in a forest , chase , or warren : fish , in an
open
river
or
pond ; or wild fowls
at their natural
liberty (s) .
But if
they are reclaimed or confined , and may serve for food , it
is otherwise even at common law
for of deer so enclosed
in a park that they may be taken
at pleasure , fish in a
trunk , and pheasants or partridges in a mew , larceny might
have been committed (t).
And now ample protection
is
extended to the owners of animals whether domesticated
or not , as well by the Larceny Act as by the game laws .
We may conveniently
notice , in the order indicated , what
has been thus done by the legislature
.
:
1. The stealing of horses , cattle , or sheep , is a felony (u) .
And , 2 , whosoever shall wilfully kill any animal with in
tent to steal the
carcase , skin , or any part of it,
shall
likewise be guilty of felony , and liable to the same pun
ishment
as if he had been convicted of feloniously stealing
the
same, provided
the
offence
of stealing
the
animal
so killed would have amounted to felony .

summary
conviction , to a pecuniary penalty (j).
And in consequence
of the dangerous conflicts which
are
apt to arise from the pursuit of game by night, the stat.
9 Geo . 4, c. 69, was passed ; by the 1st section of which
it is enacted , that if any person by night (k), unlawfully

open or
inclosed (m ) , or

enter
upon
land ,
found in possession of venison , and
not satisfactorily
accounting

And if persons , to the num
ber of three or more together , by night unlawfully enter
on land , open
or inclosed , for the purpose of taking or
destroying
game or rabbits , any of such persons
being
armed with a gun , bludgeon , or other offensive weapon ,
each and every of such persons will be guilty of a misde

in any warren or ground lawfully used for the breeding
or
keeping of hares or rabbits , whether
the
same
be in

From what has been
set forth in the preceding pages ,
we collect , that of all valuable domestic animals , as horses
and other beasts of draught , and of all animals domita
naturæ, which
serve for food, as cattle , swine ,
poultry ,
and the like, and of their fruit or produce , taken from
them
while living ,

to those animals , which do not
serve for food , and which
therefore
the law holds to have no intrinsic value , as dogs
and other creatures kept for whim
and pleasure , though a
man may have a base property therein , and maintain
a civil
action for the
loss of them (r) , yet
they are not of such
estimation
as that the crime of stealing
them
amounts at
common
law to larceny (s).
The operation of our com
mon law having
been
found
inefficacious
to protect the
property in animals from theft , has been greatly extended ,
and in some respects been rendered definite by the legis
lature .
For
the
preservation of game
especially ,
the
wrongful
pursuit of which
involves
a trespass to realty
and induces to crimes of violence , various enactments , far
more
lenient
than the
ancient forest laws , have replaced
them in the statute book .
Notwithstanding
that
larceny
cannot
be
committed
unless there be some property in the thing taken , and an
owner of it ; yet if the owner of the chattel
be unknown ,
provided
there
be
a property in it, larceny may be com
mitted by stealing
it ;
and
an
indictment
will lie for
stealing
the goods of a person
unknown (t).
In like
manner as among the Romans , the lex Hostilia defurtis
provided that a prosecution for theft might be carried
on
without
the intervention
of the owner (u).
This is the
case of stealing
a shroud out of a grave ;
which
is the
property
of those , whoever they were, who
buried
the
deceased
: but
stealing
the
corpse itself,
which
has
no
owner ,
(though
an act of great
indecency , ) is no felony ,
unless
some of the grave -cloths be stolen with it (x).
unmarked
, if in any private river or
pond ; otherwise
it is only a tres
pass .

OFFENCES
AGAINST
PROPERTY
.
Having thus
considered
the general
nature
of simple
larceny , I come next to treat of its punishment
.
Theft ,
by the Jewish
law, was only
punished
with a pecuniary
fine , and satisfaction
to the party injured (z) .
And in the
civil law, till some very late constitutions , we never find
the punishment
capital .
The laws of Draco
at Athens
punished it with death : but his laws
were
said
to be
written
in
blood ;
and
Solon
afterwards
changed
the
penalty to a pecuniary mulct.
And so the Attic
laws in
general
continued (a ) ;
except that
once , in
a time
of
dearth , it was made capital
to break into a garden , and
steal figs
but this law and the informers
against the
offence ,
grew
so
odious , that from them all malicious
informers
were styled sycophants ; a name which we have
much perverted from its original meaning .
Our ancient
Saxon
laws nominally punished
theft with
death , if above the value of twelvepence : but the criminal
was permitted
to redeem his life by a pecuniary
ransom
;
as ,
among
their
ancestors
the
Germans , by a
stated
number
of cattle (6).
In the ninth year of Henry
I. ,
however , this
power of redemption
was taken
away , and
all persons guilty of larceny
above
the value of twelve
pence
were directed to be hanged (c) ; which
law conti
nued in force until the passing of the statute 7 & 8 Geo . 4,
c. 29, by which
capital
punishment
for larceny was abo
lished , and the punishment
of this offence
is now such as
under -mentioned (d).

On
a charge,
however , of committing
or attempting
to commit
simple
larceny
(or of attempting
to
commit
larceny from the person (e) ) , where the value of the pro
perty alleged to have been stolen does
not in the opinion
of the justices
exceed
5s . , they are
empowered to hear
and determine the charge summarily
; and if the accused
confess or the charge be proved , they may convict and
sentence him to the
punishment
below
mentioned (ƒ) .
But if the person charged do not consent to have the case
summarily
heard and determined , or if it appear to such
justices that the offence
is one which , owing to a previous
conviction of the person charged , is punishable with penal

Larceny from the person is either by privately steal-

called
robbery .
The offence of privately
stealing from
a man's person ,

twelvepence ,
as by picking
his
pocket or the like ,
privily without
his knowledge ,
was
capitally
punishable and debarred of the benefit of clergy ,
so early as by the statute 8 Eliz. c. 4.
This severity seems
to have been
owing
to the
ease with which such offences
are committed , the difficulty
of guarding
against
them ,
and the boldness with which they were practised (even in
the queen's court and presence) at the time
when
this
statute was made : besides that this is an infringement
of
property , in the manual occupation
or corporal possession
of the owner , which

nature (y) .
Stealing
from the person is now punishable
as
hereinafter
stated (≈) .
Open and violent larceny from the person , or robbery ,
the rapina of the civilians , is the felonious
and forcible
taking , from the person of another , of goods
or money to
any
value , by
violence
or putting him in fear (a) .
To
constitute
this
offence :-( 1) There
must
be
a
taking ,
otherwise it is no robbery .
If, however , the thief, having
once taken a purse , returns it , still it is a robbery ; and so
it is whether the taking
be strictly from the person
of
another , or in
his presence only ;
as , where a robber by
menaces and violence puts a man in fear , and drives away
his
sheep
or his
cattle
before his
face (6).
But if the
taking be not either directly
from
his person , or in
his
presence, it is no robbery (c).
(2) It is immaterial
of
what value
the thing
taken is ;
a penny
as well
as
a
pound , thus forcibly extorted , makes
a robbery (d) .
(3)
The taking must
be by force , or
a previous putting in
fear ; which makes the violation of the person more atro
cious
than in privately
stealing .
For ,
according
to the
maxim of the civil law (e) ,
" qui vi rapuit ,fur improbior
esse videtur."
This previous violence , or putting
in fear ,
is the criterion
that distinguishes
robbery from other lar
cenies .
For if
one
privately
steals
sixpence from
the
person of another , and afterwards keeps it by putting him
in fear , this is no robbery , for the fear is subsequent to the
taking (f).
The ordinary
allegation in an indictment for
robbery
that it was done by putting
in fear,
does
not
imply any great degree
of terror
or affright
in the party
robbed
it is enough that so much force , or threatening

by word or gesture , be used , as might create
an apprehen-
sion of danger , or induce a man to part with his property
without or against
his
consent (g).
Thus , if a man be
knocked down without
previous warning , and
stripped of
his property while
senseless , though strictly he cannot be
said to be put in fear, yet
this is undoubtedly
a
robbery .
Or, if a person with
a sword drawn begs alms , and I give
it him through
mistrust and apprehension of violence , this
is a felonious robbery ( ) .
So if, under a pretence of sale ,
a man forcibly extorts money from another , neither
shall
this subterfuge
avail him.
But it may well be doubted
whether the forcing
a person to sell his wares , and giving
him
the full value of them ,
amounts
to
so
heinous
a
crime
as robbery ( ).
And upon the authorities
we may
conclude (k) that " the true
definition
of robbery
is the
stealing or taking from the
person of another , or in the
presence
of another , property of any amount , with such
a
degree of force or terror as to induce the party unwillingly
to part with his property ; and whether terror arises
from
real or expected
violence to the person , or from a sense of
injury to the character , the law makes no kind of diffe-
rence ; for to most men the idea of losing their fame and
reputation is equally if not more terrific than the dread of
personal injury.
The principal
ingredient
in robbery is a
man's being forced to part with his property " (1).
Such being
robbery
and stealing from the person
at
common law, it has been
enacted :-( 1) That whosoever
shall rob any person , or shall steal any chattel , money , or
valuable
security from the
person of another

misdemeanor (m ), of which
the
defendant
may be con
victed , although
on the trial it be proved that he obtained
the property in question in such manner as to amount in
law to larceny .
The
offence of obtaining
money or goods by false
pre
tences
is indeed very closely allied to that of larceny
(n) ,
but thus
mainly
distinguishable
from it, that in larceny
the property in the thing taken
does
not
pass , whereas
in false pretences it is meant to do so.
The pretence ,
however , to
come within the
operation
of the
above
statute , must be of an existing
fact-a mere expression
of opinion , ex. gr. as to the
quality of goods pledged or
sold (0) , or a mere statement of an intention , ex. gr. , to
pay for goods on delivery
( p ) , will
not
suffice
(q ) .
Such
pretence may ,
however, be
evidenced by the
acts
and
conduct of the defendant
without any verbal
misrepre
sentation (r).
It may be well to add that proof of the existence of a
contract between the prosecutor and defendant relating
to
the transaction , sub judice , will not necessarily secure from
punishment
the
latter
party ,
on a charge of obtaining
money
or goods by false
pretences
in conformity
with
that contract (s) ; though where a contract thus intervenes ,
a difficulty
may be felt in bringing within the statutory
definition
of the
offence

notice , every case of a
really criminal
complexion , without at the same time , and

same breath , declaring

the same was feloniously
stolen , taken , extorted , obtained ,

And
the receiv-
ing , with such
guilty
knowledge , of any property , the
stealing ,
taking,
obtaining ,
converting ,
or
disposing
whereof is made a misdemeanor by that act, is a misde-
meanor (a).
The
offence
of receiving
stolen
goods
with a guilty
knowledge
is sometimes
not easily to be distinguished
from
larceny , and
the same
evidence
may
point
to the
commission of either
crime .
Thus , on a trial for larceny
recent possession of the
chattel
charged to have
been
stolen-if unexplained
and
unaccounted
for-is
often
relied upon for the prosecution
as cogent
proof of guilt-
proof whence the jury may infer the ingredients
necessary
to the constitution of the crime specified , viz . , the taking ,
the felonious
intent , and the asportation
(b) .
A
chattel
shown to have
passed
out of the custody or possession
of
its rightful
owner in
some illegal manner may , however ,
have reached the hands of the accused , supposing him to
have been criminally implicated in the transaction , in one
or other of two ways-by his larcenous taking and aspor-
tation of the chattel , or by his receipt of it, knowing
it to
have been stolen .
It will be for the jury to determine the
nature and quality of the act from the facts in evidence

FORGERY .

XII.
Forgery , or the
crimen falsi, an
offence
which XII . For
was punished by the civil law with deportation or banish
ment , sometimes with death (d) , may with us be defined
(at common law) to be ,-the fraudulent
making
or altera
tion
of a writing
to
the
prejudice
of
another
man's
right (e) .
To constitute forgery- (1) It is
not necessary
that the
whole
instrument
should be fictitious .
The making of a
fraudulent
insertion , alteration , or erasure, in any mate
rial part of a genuine
document , by which
another may
be defrauded ; the fraudulent
application
of a false signa
ture to a true instrument
, or a real
signature
to a false
one , will suffice (f) .
(2) The very essence of forgery is
an intent
to defraud , though no damage need result from
it (g) ; the mere
imitation
of another's writing ,
the as
sumption of a name, or the alteration of a written
instru
ment , where no person
can be
injured ,
does
not
come
within the definition of this offence .
(3) The question as
to
intent
is for the jury,
and it is now
sufficient , in
an indictment for " forging , altering ,
uttering ,
offering ,
disposing
of, or putting off " (h)
an
instrument

v. Moah , Dearsl . & B. 550 ; Reg. v.
Closs , Id. 460.
(f) 1 Hale , P. C. 683-5 .
The instrument , however , must ,
in itself, be
false ; if a man merely
pass for
another , who is the
maker
or indorser
of a true instrument
,
this is no forgery , though
it may
be within the
statute
of false pre
tences .
R. v.
Hevey .
1 Leach ,
229.
The
spurious
instrument
must
bear
a resemblance
to
that
for which it is put forth , but need
not be
perfect
or
complete
; it is
sufficient
if it
is
calculated
to im
pose on mankind
in general , though
a skilled
person
would
detect its
fallacy ,

is necessary to allege an intent to defraud , to allege that
the
party
accused
did the act with such intent without
alleging
an intent to defraud a particular
person ; and on
the trial for any such offence it is sufficient to prove that
the
accused
did
the
act charged with
an intent
to de
fraud (i) .
(4 ) An
instrument
may
be
described in
an
indictment
for forging or uttering
it by
any
name or
designation
by which
the
same may be usually
known ,
without setting out any copy or fac - simile thereof

Forgery , though
amenable to punishment
at common
law, is now mainly
regulated by statute ; the 24 & 25 Vict .
c. 98 , containing
provisions
applicable to every conceiv
able kind of forgery .
Of these many are specified in the
ensuing
pages , either
briefly
or
at length , regard
being
had to their character and practical
importance .
By this
statute are constituted
felonies:
1. The forging
any transfer of stock , whether
public
or of any body corporate , or any power of attorney relating
thereto (1).
2. The personating
an owner of stock , and transferring
or receiving
or
endeavouring
to
transfer
or receive
the
dividends thereupon , as if such offender were the true and
lawful owner (m).
3. The forging an attestation to a power of attorney for
the transfer of stock , or receipt of dividends

pretences (s) , to cheat and defraud (t) , is indictable , the
conspiring
together for the purpose of effecting an illegal
object being here the substantive
offence .
Such
are the principal infringements
of the rights of
property
the last species
of offences
against individuals
or private subjects, which
the method of our distribution
has led
us
to consider .
We have
before examined the
nature of offences
against
the public , or commonwealth ;
against the sovereign or supreme magistrate , the head and
protector of that community
; against the universal law of
civilized
nations , together with some of the more atrocious
offences , of publicly pernicious
consequence
, against God
and religion .
And these several heads
seem
to compre-
hend the whole circle of crimes , cognizable by the laws of
England.

THE
MEANS
OF
PREVENTING
OFFENCES .
WE are now arrived at the fifth general branch , or head,
under which I proposed to
consider the subject of this
Book of our Commentaries
; viz . the means of preventing
the commission of crimes and misdemeanors .
And really
it is an honour to our English
laws , that they
furnish
a
title of this
sort ;
since preventive justice
is , upon every
principle of reason , of humanity , and of sound
policy ,
preferable to punishing justice (a) ; the execution of which ,
though
necessary
, and in
its
consequences
a
species
of
mercy
to
the commonwealth
,
is
attended with many harsh
and disagreeable circumstances
.
Preventive justice
may consist
-I.
in
the apprehending
of persons
at
whom suspicious circumstances point
as
likely
to commit
crime
;
or
,
II
.
in
requiring
persons
to
find
sureties for keeping the peace
,
or
for their good behaviour
;
or
,
III
.
in
making
criminal
the
having
in
possession
certain things presumably for the commission
of
crime
;
or
,
IV
.
in
searching for the evidences
of
guilt
,
and seizing
weapons
or
instruments
the use
or
possession
of
which
may scarcely be deemed
compatible with innocence

presumed that
he has changed his purpose ( ).
When a
felony is committed , or a dangerous wound is given , it is
the duty of a bystander
to arrest the offender (c) , and a
private person present
at an affray may stay the affrayers
until their heat
is
over,
and
then
deliver
them to a
constable (d).
A constable
or
peace
officer may take
into
custody,
without a warrant , any person whom he shall find loitering
in any highway , yard , or other place during the night ,
and whom he shall
have good cause to suspect of having
committed , or
being
about to commit , any felony men-
tioned in
the
act which
concerns
offences
against the
person , and shall
take
such
suspected
person as soon as
reasonably
may
be , before
a justice of the
peace , to be
dealt with according to law ( e).
By s.
103 of the
Larceny Act (24
& 25 Vict . c. 96) ,
any person found committing
an
offence ( ), punishable
either
upon indictment , or upon summary conviction , by
virtue of the act, may be immediately
apprehended with-
out a warrant
by any person , and any person
to whom
property
suspected
to have
been
stolen
is
offered , may
apprehend the party offering it.
By
s.
61 of the
act
concerning
malicious
injuries
to
property
(24 & 25 Vict . c. 97 ) , any person found commit-
ting
an
offence
against
that act may
be
apprehended
without a warrant
by a peace officer, or by the owner of
the property
injured , or his
servant , and taken
before a
justice of the peace .
Also under
s .
31 of the
act which
concerns
offences
against the coinage, it is lawful for any person whatsoever
to apprehend one found
committing
an indictable
offence

against the act , and to deliver
him into the custody of a
constable .
Such are instances exemplifying
the anxiety of our law
to prevent the
commission of crime
at the risk
even of
needlessly interfering
with the liberty of the person which
it so highly prizes .
To this
part of our subject we shall
revert
when
considering
the
mode in which a criminal
proceeding
is initiated (g) .
for the
goodbeha
II. The second kind of preventive justice
above
specified II. Sureties
consists in obliging
those persons , whom there is probable peaceor
ground to suspect of future misbehaviour , to stipulate with viour.
and to give assurance to the public , that such offence
as is
apprehended shall not happen : by finding
pledges or se
curities for keeping the peace , or for their good behaviour .
This requisition
of sureties has been several times before
mentioned
as part of the penalty
inflicted
upon
such as
have been guilty of certain felonies and misdemeanors (h) :
but there also it must be understood rather as a caution
against the repetition of the offence , than any immediate
pain or punishment .
And indeed , if we consider human
punishments
in a large
and extended view , we shall find
them all rather
calculated to prevent
future crimes , than
to expiate
the past : since, as was observed in a former
chapter (¿) , punishments
inflicted
by temporal
laws may
be classed under three heads ; such as tend to the amend
ment of the offender himself, or to deprive him of power
to do future
mischief , or to deter others by his example ;
all of which conduce to one and the same end , of prevent
ing future crimes , whether that be effected
by amendment ,
disability, or example .
The caution , however , which
we
speak of at present , is such
as is intended
merely for
prevention , without
any crime
actually committed by the
party on whose behalf
sureties
are required , but
arising
only from
a probable suspicion , that
some
crime
is in

tended or is likely
to happen ; and consequently it is not
meant in any degree
as punishment , unless perhaps for
a
man's imprudence in giving just ground of apprehension .
Under the
Saxon constitution
sureties were always
at
hand , by means of the ancient institution
of decennaries
or frankpledges
; whereby ,
as formerly
observed (k) , the
whole neighbourhood
or tithing of freemen became mutu
ally pledges for
each
other's good
behaviour .
But
this
great and general
security being
now fallen into disuse ,
there has succeeded
to it the method of making
suspected
persons find
particular
and
special
securities
for their
future conduct : of which we find mention in the laws of
king Edward the Confessor (1) ; “ inveniat fidejussores de
pace et legalitate tenendâ ."
Let us therefore consider , first ,
what this security is ; next , who may take or demand it ;
and lastly , how it may be discharged .
1. This security consists in being
bound , with
one
or
more sureties , in a recognizance or obligation
to the crown ,
entered on record , and taken
in
some
court or by some
judicial officer ; whereby the parties
acknowledge
them
selves
to be indebted
to the
crown in the sum
required
(for instance
1007. ) , with condition to be void and of none
effect, if the party shall appear in court
on
such
a day ,
and in the mean time shall keep the peace , or conditioned
to keep the peace for a certain period (m) , either generally ,
towards the queen and all her liege people ; or particularly ,
also , with regard
to the person who
craves the security.
Or, if it be for the good behaviour , then on condition
that
he shall
demean and behave himself well (or be of good
behaviour ) , either
generally
or
specially , for the
time
therein
limited ,
as for one or
more
years,
or
for
life.
This recognizance , if taken by a justice of the peace , must
be
certified
to
the next sessions in pursuance
of the

statute 3 Hen . 7, c. 1 , or, in a case of felony , to the assizes ,
pursuant to the statute 1 & 2 Ph . & M. c. 13 ; and if the
condition of such
recognizance
be broken , by any breach
of the peace in the one case , or any misbehaviour in the
other, the recognizance becomes
forfeited or absolute ; and
being estreated or extracted
(taken out from
among the
other records ) and sent up to the Exchequer (n), the party
and his sureties , having
now become
the queen's absolute
debtors , are sued for the several sums in which
they are
respectively bound .
And it is now provided by the statute
16 & 17 Vict. c. 30, s. 2 (0) , that where any recognizance
to keep the
peace , or to be of good behaviour , has been
entered
into by any person as principal
or surety at quarter
sessions , or before any justice or justices of the peace , the
quarter sessions , upon application
made to it, may declare
such recognizance
to be forfeited upon proof of a convic-
tion of the party bound thereby , of any offence
which is
in law a breach of the condition of the same, and upon
further
proof that
a notice in writing, signed by the
person seeking to put the recognizance in force , has, seven
clear days before the commencement of the sessions
, been
personally served upon , or left at the usual place of abode
of the party , or each of the parties if more than one, who
entered into such recognizance .
2. Justices of the peace , by virtue of their commission ,
or those who are ex officio
conservators of the
peace , as
mentioned in a former
volume (p), may
demand
such
security according
to their own discretion ; or it may be
granted
at the
request of any
subject , upon
due
cause
shown, provided
such demandant be under the protection
of the crown ; for which
reason it was formerly
doubted ,
whether Jews , pagans , or persons convicted of a præmu-
nire, were entitled thereto (q).
Or , if the justice is averse
to
act , it may be granted by a mandatory writ , called

supplicavit , issuing
out of the
court of queen's bench
or
chancery ; which will compel the justice to act , as a mi-
nisterial
and not as a judicial officer : and he must make
a return to such writ , specifying his compliance , under his
hand and seal (r) .
But this writ is seldom or never used :
for when application
is made to the superior courts , they
usually take the recognizances
there , under the directions
of the statute
21 Jac.
1,
c.
8.
And indeed
a peer
or
peeress
cannot be bound over in any other place than the
courts of queen's bench or chancery : though a justice of
the
peace
has
a power to require
sureties of any other
person, being
compos
mentis
and
under
the
degree
of
nobility, whether he be a fellow justice
or
other magis-
trate , or merely
a private
man ( s).
Wives may demand
it
against
their
husbands ;
or
husbands , if necessary,
against their wives (t).
But feme -coverts , and infants
under
age, ought
to find security
by their friends
only ,
and not to be bound
themselves : for they
are incapable
of engaging themselves to answer any debt ; which , as we
observed, is the nature of these recognizances or acknow-
ledgments .
In default of finding sureties when
required , the party
against
whom
the
application
for them is made may be
sent to prison , subject
to the restriction
imposed by the
stat . 16 & 17 Vict .
c . 30,
s . 3, which
enacts
that , " no
person, committed
to prison
under
any warrant
or
order
of one justice of the peace for or on account of not entering
into recognizances , or finding
sureties to keep the
peace ,
or to be of good behaviour , shall
be detained under such
warrant
or order for more than
twelve
calendar months
from the time of such commitment ."
3. A recognizance duly given may be discharged , either
by the death of the principal
party bound thereby , if not
before forfeited ; or by order of the court to which such

recognizance
is
certified by the justices
(as the
quarter
sessions , assizes , or queen's bench ) , if they
see
sufficient
cause ;
or
in
case
he at whose request it was
granted ,
if granted
upon a private account, will release it , or does
not make
his
appearance to
pray
that it may
be con-
tinued (u).
Thus far what has been said is applicable to both species
of recognizances , for the peace , and for the good behaviour ,
depace , et legalitate , tenendâ , as expressed in the laws of
king Edward .
But as these two species of securities
are
in some respects
different , especially
as to the cause of
granting , or the means of forfeiting
them , I shall now
consider them separately : and first , shall
show for what
cause
such a recognizance , with sureties for the peace , is
grantable ; and then , how it may be forfeited .
1. Any justice
of the peace may ,
ex officio ,
bind
all
those to keep the
peace , who in his presence make any
affray ; or threaten to kill or beat another ;
or contend
together with hot and angry
words ; or go
about with
unusual weapons
or attendance , to the terror of the people ;
and all such as he knows to be common barrators ; and
such
as are brought
before him by the
constable for
a
breach of the peace in his presence
; and
all
such persons
,
as
,
having been before bound
to
the peace
,
have broken
it
and forfeited their recognizances
(x).
Also
,
wherever any
private man has just
cause
to
fear that another will burn
his house
,
or
do him
a
corporal injury
,
by killing
,
im-
prisoning
,
or
beating him
;
or
that he will procure others
so
to
do
;
he may demand surety
of
the peace against such
person
and every justice
of
the peace
is
bound
to
grant
it,
if
he who demands
it
will make oath
,
that he
is
actually
under fear
of
death
or
bodily harm
;
and will show that he
has just cause
to
be
so
,
by reason
of
the other's menaces
,
attempts
,
or
having lain
in
wait
for him
;
and will also
further
swear
,
that he does
not require such surety out

of malice , or for mere vexation (y) .
This is called swear-
ing the
peace against
another ; and if the party does not
find such sureties , as the justice
in his
discretion
shall
require ,
he
may
immediately
be
committed
till he

2.
Such recognizance for keeping the peace , when given ,
be forfeited by any actual violence , or even an assault ,
or menace, to the person of him who demanded it , if it be
a special recognizance ; or, if the recognizance be general ,
by any unlawful action whatsoever , that either is or tends
to
a breach of the peace ; or, more particularly
, by
any
one of the many
species
of
offences
which
were men-
tioned
as
crimes against the public
peace
in the
tenth
chapter of this Book ; or, by any private
violence
com-
mitted against any of her majesty's subjects.
But a bare
trespass upon the
lands
or goods of another , which
is a
ground for a civil action , unless accompanied with a wilful
breach of the peace , is no forfeiture of the recognizance (a).
Neither
are mere reproachful
words , as calling
a man
a
knave or liar , any breach of the peace , so as to forfeit one's
recognizance (being looked upon to be merely the effect of
unmeaning
heat and
passion ) , unless they amount
to a
challenge to fight (b) .
The other species of recognizance , with
sureties , is for
good behaviour .
This includes security for the peace , and
somewhat more ; we will therefore examine it in the same
manner as the other .
1.
First , then , the justices
are empowered
by the statute
34 Edw . 3 , c.
1 , to bind over to the good behaviour
to-
wards the queen and her people, all them that be not of
good fame, wherever
they be found ; to the
intent
that
(y) 1 Hawk . P. C. 127.
The surety of the peace will only
be granted
where there is a fear of
some present or future
danger , and
not merely for a battery or trespass ,
or for any breach
of the
peace that
is past .

the people be not troubled
nor endamaged , nor the peace
diminished , nor
merchants
and
others, passing
by the
highways of the realm , be disturbed
nor put in the peril
which may happen by such offenders.
Under the general
words
of this
expression , " that be not of good fame ,"
it is held that a man may be bound to his good behaviour
for causes of scandal , contra bonos mores , as well as contra
pacem : or for a libel
calculated
to
cause a breach of the
peace (c) ; or for words tending to scandalize the govern
ment , or in abuse of the officers of justice , especially
in
the execution of their
office .
Thus
also
a justice
may
bind over all
night -walkers ;
eaves -droppers ;
such
as
keep suspicious
company , or are reported to be pilferers
or robbers ; such
as
sleep in
the day, and wake in the
night ; common
drunkards
; whoremasters ; the putative
fathers of bastards ;
cheats ;
idle vagabonds ;
and
other
persons whose misbehaviour
may reasonably bring them
within the general words of the statute , as persons not of
good fame : an expression , it must be owned , of so great
a latitude , as leaves
much to be determined by the discre
tion of the magistrate himself(d).
But , if he commits a
man for want of sureties , he must express the cause thereof
with convenient certainty ; and take care
that
such cause
be a good one (e).
2. A recognizance
for the good behaviour may be for
feited by the same
means, as one for the
security of the
peace
may
be ; and also by some
others .
As , by going
armed with unusual attendance , to the terror of the people ;
by speaking words tending to sedition ; or by committing
any of those
acts of misbehaviour , which the recognizance
was intended to prevent .
But not by barely giving fresh
cause of suspicion of that which perhaps
may never actually

per-
sons to give
security to the public against misbehaviour
that is apprehended ; yet it would be hard , upon such sus-
picion , without the proof of any actual
crime , to punish
them by a forfeiture of their recognizance .
III . The third
head under which preventive justice may
be treated of, necessitates a
reference
to statutory
provi-
sions, rendering
illegal , unless satisfactorily
accounted
for ,
the possession of certain
things
presumably for the com-
mission of crime . In the recent Consolidation
and Amend-
ment Acts , many such provisions , of which some have been
already noticed ,
are
contained .
To the
constitution
of
such an offence
a criminal
intent , or guilty knowledge , is
sometimes
made
essential , whilst at other
times
it is
not so (g).
Clauses such as
now
alluded to are distin-
guishable
from
those
which
render
the
possession
of
property , if unexplained , presumptive evidence of antece-
dent crime .
IV. A warrant
may in some
cases
be granted by a
justice of the
peace
to search
for
and seize property sus-
pected to have been stolen , sufficient ground for suspicion
having
been shown (h) .
The searching for stolen
goods
under the warrant of a justice
is said by Lord Camden (¿)
to have " crept into the law by imperceptible practice ,” and
to be " guarded with much circumspection ."
A justice of
the
peace
may also , under
some other circumstances , in
virtue of express
enactment , exercise a like power , ex. gr.,
he may issue a warrant
to search for and
seize explosive
substances under the 24 & 25 Vict . c. 100 , s . 65 (k)—and

sonable
cause to suspect that
any person has in his
pos-
session
or on his premises any property whatsoever , with
respect to which an offence
punishable
under the Larceny
Act has
been committed , a warrant
may be granted to
search for such property , as in the case of stolen goods ,
and any person to whom
such property
is offered
to be
sold , pawned, or delivered , is required , having
reasonable
ground of suspicion , to apprehend the party offering the
same , and to take him , together with the property , before
ajustice of the peace . A warrant may also be issued by a
justice
under the Forgery Act (24 & 25 Vict . c . 98 , s. 46) ,
to search for paper or implements employed in forging ,
and for forged instruments , and , under the act relating
to
coinage
offences
(24 & 25 Vict . c. 99 , s. 27 ) , for the dis-
covery and seizure of counterfeit coin and coining tools (1).
In the above as well
as in other
cases , which cannot here
be particularised
(m) , a search warrant
is allowed
to be
issued
with a view to the prevention of crime , and the
detection , perchance
, of criminals .

CHAPTER

Mode of in

COURTS
OF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION.
THE
sixth , and last , object of our inquiries will be the
method of inflicting those punishments
which the law has
annexed to particular
offences . In the discussion of which
I shall , first , specify the several courts of criminal juris
diction , wherein
offenders may be prosecuted to punish
ment ; and secondly , mention , in their natural order , and
explain , the proceedings therein respectively .
Courts of
criminal
In this
inquiry , concerning
courts of criminal jurisdic
jurisdiction
tion , which will be very brief, I shall rank them according
to their dignity,
and
begin
with
the
highest
of all ;
viz.:
I. High
court of
I. The high court of parliament
; which is the supreme
parliament. court in the kingdom , not only for the making , but also
for the execution of laws ; by the trial of great and enor
mous
offenders,
whether
lords
or
commoners , in
the
method of parliamentary
impeachment .
As for
acts
of
parliament
to
attaint
particular
persons
of treason
or
felony , or to inflict pains
and penalties , beyond or con
trary to the common law, to serve a special purpose , I
speak not of them ; being to all intents and purposes new
laws , made pro re natâ , and by no means an execution of
such as are already in being .
But an impeachment before

the
most
solemn
grand
inquest of the
kingdom (a) .
A commoner (b) as well
as a peer may be
impeached for any crime .
And the lords usually , in
case
of the impeachment of a peer for
treason , address
the
crown to appoint
a lord high steward , for the
greater
dignity and regularity
of their proceedings , who is com
missioned
accordingly
by the crown (c).
The
articles of
impeachment
are prepared and
agreed
to by the house of
commons , and afterwards
tried by the lords ; who are in
such cases considered not only as their own peers , but as
the peers of the whole
nation .
This is
a custom appa
rently derived to us from the ancient Germans ; who in
their great councils
sometimes
tried
capital
accusations
relating to the
public
:
" licet apud
concilium
accusare
quoque ,
et discrimen capitis
intendere " (d).
And it has a
peculiar
propriety
in the English
constitution ;
which
has
much
improved
upon
the
ancient
model
imported
hither from
the
continent .
For , though in general the
union of the legislative
and judicial powers ought to be
carefully
avoided (e) , yet it may happen

Adam Blair
and four
other
com
moners were impeached for high trea
son , in having published a proclama
tion of James II. On the 2nd ofJuly
a long
report
of
precedents
was
produced , and a question
was put
to the judges whether
the record ,
4 Edw. 3, No.
6, was
a
statute .
They answered ,
as it appeared
to
them by the copy , they believed it
to be a statute ; but if they saw the
roll itself,
they could
be more po
sitive .
It was then
moved to ask
the
judges , but the
motion
was
negatived , whether
by this
record
the lords were barred from trying a
commoner for a capital
crime upon
an impeachment
of the
commons .
And they immediately
resolved
to
proceed in this impeachment , not
withstanding
the parties were com
moners
and
charged
with
high
treason .

The

intrusted
with the
administration
of public
affairs , may
infringe the
rights of the people , and be guilty of such
crimes ,
as
the
ordinary
magistrate
either
dares
not
or
cannot punish .
Of these the representatives of the people ,
or house of commons , cannot properly
judge ;
because
their constituents are the parties injured ; they can there
fore
only
impeach .
But
before
what
court
shall this
impeachment be tried ?
Not before the ordinary tribunals ,
which might be swayed
by the authority of so powerful
an
accuser .
That branch of the legislature , therefore , which
represents
the people , brings
its charge before the other
branch , which
consists of the nobility, who have
neither
the same interests nor the same passions as popular assem
blies (f) .
Our
constitution
deems
it proper
that
the
nobility should judge , to
insure justice
to the
accused
;
that the people should
accuse
to
insure justice to the
commonwealth .
And hence, besides other extraordinary
circumstances attending the authority of this court , there
is one of a very singular nature , which was insisted on by
the house of commons in the case of the earl of Danby in
the reign of Charles II. ( g)—and it is now
enacted by
statute 12 & 13 Will . 3 , c. 2 ,-that no pardon
under the
great seal shall
be pleadable
to an impeachment by the
commons of Great Britain in parliament .
II. The court of the lord high steward (h) is a court in
stituted for the trial of peers , indicted for treason or felony ,
or for misprision
of either (i) .
The
office of this great
magistrate
is very ancient ; and was formerly heredifary ,
or at least held
for life, or dum bene se gesserit : but now
it is and has been for centuries past (k) , granted pro hâc
vice
only ;
and it has
been the constant
practice
(and
therefore seems now to have become
necessary ) to grant it
to
a lord of parliament , else
he is incapable

delinquent
peer (7).
When , therefore , such an indictment
is found by a grand jury of freeholders in the queen's bench ,
or at the assizes
before the justices of oyer and terminer, it
has to be removed by a writ of certiorari
into the court of
the lord high steward , which only has power to determine
it.
A peer may plead a pardon before the court of queen's
bench , and the judges have power to allow it ; in order to
prevent the trouble of appointing
a high steward , merely
for the purpose of receiving
such plea .
But the accused
may not plead , in that
inferior
court , any other plea : as
"guilty ," or " not guilty ," but
only in this
court : be
cause, in consequence
of such
plea , it is
possible
that
judgment of death might be awarded
against him .
The
crown , therefore , in case
a peer be indicted
for
treason
,
felony , or misprision
of either , creates
a lord high steward
pro hac vice by commission
under the great seal ; which
recites the indictment
so found , and gives his grace
power
to
receive and
try it ,
secundum

et
consuetudinem
Anglia .
Then , when the indictment
is regularly
removed ,
by writ
of certiorari , commanding
the inferior court
to
certify
it up to him, the lord high steward
directs
a
precept to a serjeant
at arms , to summon the lords
to
attend
and try the
indicted
peer .
This
precept
was
formerly
issued
to
summon
only
eighteen

twenty ,
selected from
the
body of the
peers
: then
the
number
came to be indefinite
; and the custom was for the lord
high steward to summon as many
as he thought
proper
(latterly not less than
twenty -three ( m ) ) , and that those
lords only
should sit upon the trial : which threw a mon
strous weight of power into the hands of the crown
and
this its great officer, of selecting
only such peers
as the

then predominant
party
should
most
approve of.
And
accordingly , when the earl of Clarendon fell into disgrace
with Charles II. , there was a design
formed to prorogue
the parliament , in order to try him by a select number of
peers ; it being doubted whether the whole house could be
induced to fall in with the views of the court (n).
But
now by statute
7 Will . 3 , c . 3 , upon all trials of peers for
treason or misprision , all the
peers who have
a right to
sit and vote in parliament
shall be summoned , at least
twenty days before such trial , to appear and vote therein ;
and every lord
appearing
shall vote in the trial of such
peer.
During the session of parliament
the trial of an indicted
peer is not properly in the court of the lord high steward,
but before the court last mentioned , of our lord the king,
or of our lady the queen , in parliament (o).
It is true , a
lord
high steward is always
appointed
in that
case ,
to
regulate
and add weight
to the
proceedings : but
he is
rather in the nature of a speaker pro tempore , or chairman
of the court , than the judge of it ; for the collective body
of the peers
are therein the judges
both of law and fact ,
and the high steward has a vote with the rest, in right of
his peerage.
But in the court of the lord high steward ,
which is held
in the
recess of parliament , he is the
sole
judge of matters of law, as the lords triers are in matters
of fact ; and
as they may not interfere with him in regu
lating the proceedings of the court , so he has no right to
intermix with them in giving any vote upon the trial (p).
Therefore , upon
the
conviction
and attainder of a peer
for
murder in full
parliament , it

judges (q), that in case the day appointed in the judgment
for execution
should
lapse before execution
done , a new
time of execution
may be appointed by either
the high
court of parliament
during
its
sitting, though
no high
steward
be existing ; or, in the
recess of parliament , by
the court of queen's
bench , the record being removed into
that court .
It has been a point of some controversy , whether
the
bishops
have now a right to sit in the court of the lord
high steward , to try indictments
of treason and mispri
sion (r) .
Some incline
to imagine
them
included under
the general words of the statute of king William , “ all
peers , who have a right to sit and vote in parliament
;
but the expression had been much clearer , if it had been
all " lords ," and not all " peers
; " for though bishops , on
account of the
baronies annexed
to their bishoprics , are
clearly
lords
of parliament , yet , their
blood
not
being
ennobled , they are not universally allowed to be peers with
the temporal
nobility
: and perhaps this word
might
be
inserted
purposely with
a view to exclude them .
How
ever , there
is no instance of their sitting on
trials
for
capital
offences , even upon impeachments
or indictments
in full
parliament , much
less in the court
we are now
treating of; for indeed they usually withdraw voluntarily,
but enter
a protest
declaring
their right to stay.
It is
observable
that , in the eleventh chapter of the constitu
tions of Clarendon , made in parliament
11 Hen . 2 , they
are expressly excused , rather than
excluded , from
sitting
and voting
in trials , when they
come to
concern
life or
limb : "episcopi ,
sicut
cæteri
barones ,
debent
interesse
judiciis cum baronibus, quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem
membrorum , vel ad mortem : " and Becket's quarrel with the
king hereupon was not on account of the exception (which

was agreeable to the canon law) , but of the general rule ,
that
compelled
the
bishops to attend
at all .
And the
determination of the house of lords in the earl of Danby's
case (s) , which
has ever
since
been
adhered to , is conso-
nant to these constitutions
: " that
the lords spiritual
have
a right
to stay
and sit in court
in capital
cases , till
the court proceeds to the
vote of guilty , or not guilty."
It must be noted that this resolution extends only to trials
in full parliament
: for to the court of the lord high steward
(in which no vote can be given , but merely that of guilty ,
or not guilty ) no bishop , as such, ever was or could
be
summoned ;
and
though
the
statute of king William
regulates the proceedings in that
court , as well as in the
court of parliament , yet it never intended
to new-model
or alter its
constitution
; and consequently does not give
the lords spiritual any right in cases of blood which they
had not before (t) .
And what makes their exclusion more
reasonable is , that
they have no right to be tried them-
selves in the court of the lord high steward (u) , and there-
fore surely ought not to be judges there.
For the privilege
of being thus tried depends
upon nobility
of blood , rather
than
a seat in the house : as
appears from the trials
of
popish lords , of lords under age , and (since the union ) of
the
Scotch nobility, though
not in the number
of the
sixteen ; and from the trials of females , such as the queen
consort
or dowager ,
and
of all
peeresses
by birth ;
a
peeress by marriage also , unless she has, when a dowager ,
disparaged
herself by taking a commoner for her second
husband , is entitled to a like privilege (x).
Upon conviction
for felony , a peer is now liable to the
same punishment
as any other subject of the
crown (y),
and
for
a
misdemeanor ,
as libel , he is liable
in like
manner as a commoner (≈).

court may order that it be
tried at the central criminal
court (d).
The judges of the court of queen's bench are the supreme
coroners of the kingdom .
And
the
court itself is the
principal
court of general criminal
jurisdiction (though
the two already
noticed
are of greater dignity) known to
the laws of England .
For which reason , by the coming
of the court of queen's bench into any county (as it was
removed to Oxford
on account of the sickness in 1665 ) ,
all former
commissions of oyer
and terminer, and general
gaol
delivery , are at once
absorbed
and determined
ipso
facto : in the same manner
as by the
old
Gothic
and
Saxon constitutions , "jure
vetusto obtinuit, quierisse omnia
inferiora judicia dicente jus rege " (e).
It has been held , however , that the authority of a court
of quarter sessions , whether for a county or a borough , is
not in law determined
or suspended by the coming of the
judges into the county under their commission (ƒ).

lowable
to propose
another
conjec-
tural
etymology ,
as
plausible ,
perhaps , as any of them . It is well

of the Jews under
Edward
1, their
contracts
and
obligations
were
de-
nominated
starra
or starrs , from
a
corruption

very ancient
origin ( ), but new-modelled by statutes 3
Hen. 7, c. 1 , and 21 Hen. 8 , c. 20 , consisting of divers lords
spiritual and temporal , being privy counsellors , together
with
two judges
of the
courts of common law, without
the intervention
of any jury .
Their jurisdiction extended
legally over riots , perjury , misbehaviour
of sheriffs , and
other notorious misdemeanors , contrary to the laws of the
land .
Yet , this was afterwards
(as Lord
Clarendon in
forms
us ( ) ) stretched " to the
asserting of all procla
mations , and orders of state : to the vindicating
of illegal
shetar , a covenant .
(Tovey's Angl .
Judaic .
32 ; Selden , Tit. of Hon .
ii. 34 ; Uxor Ebraic . i . 14.)
These
starrs , by an
ordinance
of Richard
1,
preserved
by
Hoveden ,
were
commanded
to be enrolled
and de
posited in chests under three keys
in
certain
places ;
one,
and
the
most considerable , of which
was in
the
king's
exchequer
at
West
minster ; and
no starr was allowed
to be valid
unless it were found in
some of the said repositaries .
(Me
morand . in Scacc . P. 6 Edw. 1, pre
fixed to Maynard's Year-book of Edw.
2, fol. 8 ; Madox , Hist . Exch . c. 7,
ss . 4, 5, 6. )
The
room
at the ex
chequer , where the chests
contain
ing these starrs were kept, was pro
bably called
the
' starr -chamber ; '
and when
the Jews were
expelled
the kingdom ,
was
applied
to the
use of the king's council , sitting in
their judicial capacity .
To confirm
this , the first time the starr -chamber
is
mentioned
in
any
record , it
is
said to have been situated
near the
receipt of the exchequer
at West
minster ;
(the king's
council , his
chancellor , treasurer , justices , and
other
sages, were
assembled
en la
chaumbre
des esteilles pres la res
ceipt al Westminster .- Rot . Claus .
41 Edw. 3, m. 13.)
For in process
of time , when the
meaning
of the
Jewish
starrs
was
forgotten ,
the
word
star -chamber
was
naturally
rendered in law French , les chaum
bre des esteilles, and in law Latin
camera
stellata ; which continued
to be the style in Latin till the dis
solution of that court .
Another
explanatory
derivation
of star -chamber has been offered:
In one of the statutes
of the uni
versity of Cambridge , the antiquity
of which
is not
known , the
word
starrum
is twice used for a schedule
or inventory .
The
statute
is
en
titled
De
computatione
procurato
rum , and it directs that in fine com

Such

would
be

committed
either
upon
the

or
on

or

county ;

and
mayhem happening in great ships being
and hovering
in
the main stream of great rivers , below the bridges of the
same
rivers , which are then
a sort of ports or havens ;
such as are the ports of London
and
Gloucester , though
they lie at
a great
distance from the
sea .
But , as this
court
proceeded
without a jury , in a method
much con
formed
to the civil law, the
exercise by it of a criminal
jurisdiction
was
contrary
to the
genius
of the law of
England ; inasmuch
as a man might
be there deprived of
his life by the
opinion
of a single judge , without
the
judgment of his peers .
And , besides , as innocent persons
might thus fall a sacrifice to the caprice of a single
man ,
so very gross
offenders might , and did frequently , escape
punishment
: for the rule of the civil law is , how reason
ably I shall
not at present
inquire , that no judgment
of
death
can be given
against
offenders
, without
proof by
two witnesses , or a confession of the fact by themselves.
This was always a great
offence
to the English
nation ;
and therefore
in
the
eighth
year of Henry VI. it was
endeavoured to apply a remedy in parliament
: which then
miscarried for want of the royal assent.
However , by the
statute
28
Hen.
8 ,
c .
15 , it was
enacted ,
that
these
offences
should
be tried by commissioners
of oyer
and
terminer , under the king's great seal : namely , the admiral
or his deputy , and three or four more (among whom
two
common law judges were usually
appointed ) ; the indict
ment
being
first
found by a grand jury of twelve
men ,
and
afterwards tried by a petty jury : and that the course
of proceedings
should
be according to the law of the
land.
(m) If a pistol be fired on shore,
which kills a man at sea, the offence
is properly
triable
under the admi
ralty jurisdiction , because the mur
der is , in
law,
committed
where
the
death
occurs ;

COURTS

The above mentioned statute of Henry 8 , merely altered
the mode of trial in the Admiralty court ,
its
jurisdiction
still continuing
to
rest on the same foundations
as
before
that statute
;
being regulated by the civil law
,
et

grounded
on the law
of

The power
of
the commissioners
appointed
under the

it
to
treasons

were directed
to
be tried
.
Moreover
as
persons tried for murder under
this

statute
could
not be found guilty
of

,
and
,
where the circumstances reduced the crime
to

,
were

the

(d) We find one of the judges
(temp. Geo . I. ) complaining
to the
then
chancellor
of
the
apathy
evinced by justices
of the peace in
regard
to the
discharging
of this
portion
of
their
duty ; he
says,
(15 St. Tr. 1421-2 ) " that there
was
grown
up
a sort of
general
neglect all over England
of the
ap-
pearance
of the
justices
of the
peace
at
the
assizes,
when
the
judges
had
often matters to inform
them of by the king's
command ,"
he complains
that " trials of felons
were
often
imperfect
by the non-
attendance
of
the
committing
justices ," he
urges that their
at-
tendance
is a respect
due
to the
king , upon
so solemn an occasion ,
certainly
no
hardship
upon
them ,
inasmuch
as three
grounds
of ex-
cuse will readily be
admitted if
stated to the
court : 1.
That the
justice
is not
fit
to
travel
through
age
or
ill
-
health
;
2.
That
he
is
living
permanently
,
or
,

is
casually out
of
the county

which
the assizes are being held

,

,


COURTS
OF OYER
AND
TERMINER
.
351
But the fourth authority is the commission of oyer and ter
miner , to hear and determine all treasons, felonies , and
misdemeanors .
This is directed to the circuit judges and
usually
also
to some
serjeants
at law, queen's counsel ,
or barristers
with patents of precedence
(e) , who attend
the circuit.
The
words
of the
commission
are , " to
inquire , hear, and determine
: " so that by virtue of this
commission
they
can only
proceed
upon
an indictment
found at the same assizes
; for they must first inquire
by
means
of the
grand
jury
or
inquest ,
before
they
are
empowered to hear and determine by the help of the petit
jury.
Therefore they have, besides , fifthly, a commission
of general
gaol
delivery ; which
empowers them
to try
and deliver
every prisoner , who shall be in the gaol when
the judges arrive
at the circuit town , whenever
or before
whomsoever
indicted , or for whatever
crime
committed .
It was anciently the course to issue special writs
of gaol
delivery
for
each
particular
prisoner , which
were called
the writs de bono et malo (ƒ) : but these being found incon
venient and oppressive , a general
commission for all the
prisoners
has long been established in their stead .
So
that,
one
way or
other,
the
gaols
are in
general
cleared , and all offenders tried , punished , or delivered , at
least
twice in every year :
a constitution
of singular
use
and excellence.
We may observe
also that winter
assizes
are held when
expedient
to clear
the gaols in counties
where crime
may have been prevalent , as also to prevent
the undue
languishing
in prison of accused
persons , and
the charge for their
support , which would
be thrown.
upon the county rates.
And that sometimes , upon urgent
occasions , a special or extraordinary
commission
of oyer
and terminer , and gaol delivery , is issued by the crown (g),
confined
to those offences
which stand in need of imme
or to avoid the trouble of attending
at
the assizes,
this
ought
to
be
looked on as a neglect of the duty of
their office."

: upon which the course of
proceeding is much the same as upon general and ordinary
commissions .
Formerly it was held , in pursuance of the
repealed (h) statutes 8 Ric . 2 , c. 2 , and 33 Hen. 8 , c. 24 ,
that no judge or other lawyer could act in the commission
of oyer and terminer , or in that of gaol delivery , within his
own
county
where he was
born
or inhabited ; in like
manner as they were prohibited from being judges of assize
and determining
civil
causes .
But that local partiality ,
which the jealousy of our ancestors
was careful to prevent ,
being judged
less likely to operate
in the trial of crimes
and
misdemeanors , than in matters of property and dis-
putes between party and party , it was thought
proper , by
the statute
12 Geo. 2 ,
c. 27 , to allow any man
to be a
justice
of
oyer

gaol
delivery
within any county of England.

of all felonies

whatsoever ,
except

statute , for which another mode of trial might be directed ,
and of all
offences
less than
felony , with
one
or two
exceptions of little practical
importance , and resting on a
principle
not easily to be discovered (q) .
But
though
the justices in quarter
sessions
assembled
thus
theoretically
possessed
an
ample
jurisdiction
,
in
practice
they seldom , if ever , tried
any
offences
greater
than small felonies within the benefit of clergy (r) ; their
commission providing , that if any case of difficulty arises ,
they shall
not
proceed to judgment, but in the presence
of one of the judges
of assize.
And therefore murders ,
and
other
capital
felonies , were usually
remitted
for a
more
solemn
trial to the
assizes .
Nor, as above in-
timated ,
could this court try
any new-created
offence ,
without
express
power
given them by the statute which
created it (s).
And recently the jurisdiction
of the court
of quarter

enacted
that neither the justices of the peace acting in and for any
county , riding , division , or liberty , nor the recorder of a

thereof , try any person for any treason , murder , or capital
felony ,
or for any felony
which , when
committed
by a
person
not
previously
convicted
of felony , is punishable
by transportation
for life , or now by penal

COURTS
OF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION.
Notwithstanding
the restrictions
which have been
thus
wisely imposed by the legislature
on the judicial
powers
exercisable by justices
at quarter
sessions , there
are still
many
ordinary
offences
and
particular
matters
which
belong
properly
to
this jurisdiction ,
and
ought to
be
prosecuted in this court (2).
Some of these are proceeded
upon by indictment
;
and others in a summary
way by
motion
and
order thereupon ; which
order may for the
most part , unless guarded
against by particular
statutes ,
be
removed
into
the
court of queen's
bench , by writ
of certiorari facias , and be there either quashed
or con
firmed .
The
court
of
quarter
sessions
has
also
an
appellate jurisdiction , which
has
been
entirely
conferred
by statute , in relation
to summary convictions and orders
made by justices .
The records or rolls of the sessions
are committed
to the
custody of a special
officer denominated
the
custos rotu
lorum , who
is
always
a justice of the peace
; and among
his fellow justices of especial consequence
and standing
(@).
The nomination
of the custos rotulorum (who is
the prin
cipal
civil officer in the county , as the lord lieutenant is
the chief in military command ) is by the queen's
sign
manual
and to him belongs
the nomination of the clerk
of the peace (b) , who acts ministerially
at quarter sessions
and is removable for misconduct
by the justices (c ).
Even
prior to the statute
5 & 6 Will . 4, c . 76 , there
were in most cities and towns
corporate
quarter
sessions
held
before the mayor and justices for the trial of minor
offences
committed within the municipal
boundaries ; and,
in
performing
their
judicial
duties ,
these
magistrates
were usually assisted by a barrister , who acted
as assessor

But by the act just
named (amended
by the 6 & 7 Will. 4 ,
c . 105 , and 6 & 7 Vict . c. 89 ) , im
portant alterations have been made in the constitution of
borough courts of quarter
sessions.
The 103rd section of
this act empowers the crown , on the petition of the council
of any borough , setting
forth
the matters
therein
men
tioned , to grant that a separate court of quarter
sessions
of the peace shall
be thenceforward
held therein presided
over by a barrister of not less than five years ' standing , as
recorder , who is to be ex officio
a justice
of the
peace
for
the said borough ; and sect . 105 directs that such recorder
shall hold , once in every quarter of a year at least , a court
of quarter
sessions of the
peace
for
the borough
;
and
enacts , that his court shall be a court of record , and shall
have cognizance of all offences
and matters cognizable by
any court of quarter sessions of the
peace
for counties ;
except that the recorder may not make a county rate, nor
grant alehouse licences ,
nor
exercise any of the
powers
specially vested by the act in the council of the borough .
A subsequent statute ,
1 Vict . c. 78 , s . 49 , empowers
the
crown to grant a charter of incorporation
to
any town
or
borough not previously incorporated , and to extend to the
inhabitants
thereof all the powers and provisions
of the
5 & 6 Will . 4 , c. 76 .

or sudden death , by what
manner
he came to his

And this the

to do super visum

Of the coroner and his
office we treated at

officers

risdiction , and the proceedings

tribunals .
IX . The sheriff's tourn (h) , or rotation , was a court of
record , held twice every year within a month after Easter
and Michaelmas , before
the sheriff , in different parts of the
county ; being indeed
only the " turn " of the
sheriff
to
keep
a court
leet in
each respective
hundred ( ) : this
therefore was the
great
court -leet of the county ,
as the
county court was the court-baron : for out of this , for the
ease of the sheriff , was taken :-
X. The court -leet, or view of frankpledge
( ) , being
a
court of record , held once in the year and not oftener (1) ,
within a particular
hundred , lordship , or manor before the
steward of the leet :
a court granted
by charter from the
crown to the lord of such hundred or manor .
Its original
intent was to view the frank pledges , that is , the freemen
within the liberty
; who , according
to the
institution
of
the Anglo -Saxons , were all mutually
pledges for the good
behaviour of each other.
Besides this , the preservation of
the peace , and the chastisement of divers minute
offences
against the public good , were the objects both of the court-
leet and the sheriff's
tourn ; which
had exactly the same

of
criminal jurisdiction ; coeval with
the
establishment
of the
Saxons

either
amongst

Romans

Britons, but the activity of those
courts is marked
very visibly both
amongst

Saxons
and

jurisdiction , one being only a larger
species of the other,
extending
over more territory , but not over more causes .
All freeholders within the precincts , and all persons com
morant
therein , with certain
exceptions , were
obliged
to
attend
them , to appear upon the jury , if required , and
to make
their
due presentments .
It was also anciently
the custom to
summon
all the king's
subjects , as they
respectively
grew
to years of discretion and strength , to
to
the
court -leet ,
and
there
take
the
oath of
allegiance
to the king .
The
other general
business of
the leet and tourn , was to present by jury all crimes what
soever
that
happened within their jurisdiction
; and not
only to present , but also to punish , trivial misdemeanors ,
as trivial debts were recoverable in the court baron , and
county court :
justice , in these minuter
matters of both
kinds , being brought
home to the doors of every man by
our ancient constitution .
Thus in the Gothic
constitution ,
the hæreda , which
answered
to our court-leet , " de omnibus
quidem cognoscit , non tamen
de omnibus judicat ” (m) .
The
objects
of their jurisdiction were
therefore
unavoidably
very numerous : being such as in some
degree , either less
or more, affected
the public weal , or good governance of
the district in which they arose ; from common nuisances
and other material
offences
against the king's peace
and
public trade , down to
eaves -dropping , waifs , and irregu
larities in public commons .
But both the tourn
and the
leet have
been
for
a long
time
in a declining
way :
a
circumstance , owing in part to the discharge
granted
by
the statute of Marlbridge
, 52 Hen . 3 , c. 10 , to all prelates ,
peers , and clergymen , from their attendance
upon
these
courts ; which
occasioned them
to grow into disrepute .
And hence it is that their business has for the most part
gradually devolved upon the quarter sessions
; which it is
particularly directed to do in some cases by statute 1 Edw .

persons who have been subpoenaed
as witnesses shall , until
summoned or called for , absent themselves from court to
prevent collusive evidence being given and perjury perhaps
being committed .
The question whether the court of the coroner is
to be
regarded as an open and public
court , has been solemnly
discussed, and it has been judicially observed
(t) that the
inquiry
concerning the death of a person " ought
for the
purposes of justice
in some
cases
to be
conducted
in
secresy ; it is a preliminary
inquiry which may or may not
end in the accusation of a particular
individual
.
It may
be requisite
that
a suspected
person
should
not in so
early a stage be informed
of the suspicion
that may be
entertained against him , and of the evidence on which it is
founded , lest he should elude justice by flight, by tamper
ing with witnesses ,
or otherwise ."
Who , then, is
to
decide whether
privacy
be
necessary or
proper ?
The
coroner alone ; and even in
cases where
absolute privacy
may not be required ,
the
exclusion
from the room in
which the inquest
is held
of particular
persons , may be
necessary or proper (u).
In
answering
the
question ,
however , whether
a par
ticular court is to be deemed
a public and open court , not
only
general
considerations
of
expediency , but
express
enactments
may have to be
noticed ;
for
instance , the
legislature
has
thought
fit
to
require
publicity where
a
justice
is
engaged
in
an
investigation
with
a
view
to
sum
mary conviction
(a),
but not
so
where the investigation
is
preliminary
merely
to
commitment
.

of the
duties of justices
of the
peace
out of sessions
with respect
to summary convictions
and
orders , ) it is
enacted
as follows :-That the room or place in which the
justice shall sit to hear any such complaint
or information
as in that statute specified " shall be deemed
an open and
public
court
to
which
the

generally
may have

sessions for the
purposes of that
act shall
be an
open

On
the
other hand , by the
11
&
12
Vict. c. 42, s . 19 , it is enacted
that the room
or building
in which the examination of witnesses is taken prelimi-
nary to the commitment
of an accused
person under the
provisions of that statute , " shall not be deemed
an open
court for that purpose ,
and it
shall
be lawful for
the
justice in his discretion " to order that no person shall
have access to, or be , or remain in such room or building
without the consent
or permission
of the justice , “ if it
appear
to him
that
the
ends
of justice
will be
best
answered
by so
doing ."
The legislature
thus
enacting
have
done
so
conformably to the
above views judicially
expressed , for in
preliminary
investigations
as
to the
commission of crime publicity may often defeat the very
end in view ; although where investigation is to be imme-
diately followed

The
contempts
thus

are either direct

openly insult or resist
the
powers of the
court ,
or the
persons of the judges who preside there ; or else are con
sequential , which (without
such gross insolence or direct
opposition ) plainly tend
to
create
an universal
disregard
of their authority .
The principal
instances , of either sort ,
usually
punished
by attachment (z) , are
as follow :-1 .
Those
committed by inferior judges
and magistrates
: by
acting unjustly, oppressively , or irregularly, in adminis
tering
such
portions
of justice
as are intrusted to their
distribution
; or by disobeying
the
queen's writs
issuing
out of the superior courts , by proceeding in a cause after
it is put
a stop
to or removed by writ of prohibition,
certiorari , error , supersedeas
, and the like .
For,
as the
superior courts (and especially the court of queen's bench )
have
a general
superintendence over all inferior jurisdic
tions , any corrupt
or
iniquitous
practices
of subordinate
judges
are contempts
of that superintending
authority,
whose duty it is to keep them within the bounds of justice .
2.
Those committed by sheriff's , bailiffs , gaolers , and other
officers of the
court : by abusing the process of the law,
or deceiving the parties , by acts of oppression , extortion ,
or
collusive
behaviour , or by culpable neglect of duty .
3. Those
committed
by counsel ( a)
or by
attornies
and
solicitors , who are officers of the respective courts : involv
ing fraud and corruption , injustice
to their clients , or other
dishonest
practice .
For
the
malpractice
of the
officers
reflects
some
dishonour
on
their
employers ;
and , if
frequent or unpunished , might create among the people
a
disgust
against
the
courts themselves .
4.
Those com
mitted by jurymen , in collateral
matters
relating to the
discharge
of their office : such as making default when
summoned ; refusing
to be sworn , or to give any verdict
;
eating
or drinking without
the leave of the court , and
especially
at the
cost of either
party ; and
other
mis
behaviours or irregularities
of a like kind : but not in the

mere exercise of their judicial capacities, as by giving a
false
or erroneous verdict (b).
5. Those
committed by
witnesses , by making
default when
summoned , refusing
to be sworn , or on examination
to answer a proper ques
tion (c) , or prevaricating
in their evidence when
sworn .
6.
Those committed
by parties to any suit or proceeding
before
the court : as by disobedience to a rule or order ,
made in the
progress
of a
cause
;
by non -payment of
costs
awarded by the
court upon
motion ;
or
by
non
observance of the award of an arbitrator
or umpire , the
submission
having been made a rule of court (d).
Indeed
the attachment for a contempt of this
species ,
and
espe
cially for non -payment of costs or non -performance of an
award , is to be looked upon rather
as a civil execution for
the benefit of the injured
party , though
carried on in the
shape of a criminal
process
for contempt of the authority
of the court .
And therefore it has been held that such a
contempt , and
the process thereon , being
properly
the
civil remedy of an individual
for
a private
injury is not
released or affected
by a general act of pardon .
And upon
a similar principle ,
obedience
to a rule of court may by
statute

enforced
against
any

7. Those
committed
by any persons ,
including peers , when accompanied with violence , such as
forcible
rescue and the like (e) ; or when they import
a
disobedience to the great prerogative writs , of prohibition
,
habeas
corpus (f) , and the rest.
Some of these contempts
may arise in the face of the
court ;
as by rude and con
tumelious
behaviour ; by obstinacy , perverseness
, or pre
varication ;
by breach of the
peace , or any wilful dis

turbance whatever (g) : others in the absence of the party ;
as by disobeying
or treating with disrespect the
queen's
writ, or the rules
or process of the court ; by perverting
such writ or process to the
purposes of private
malice ,
extortion ,
or injustice
; by speaking or writing contemp
tuonsly of the judges ,
acting
in
their judicial
capacity ;
by printing
a false
account (or even a true one in dis
obedience
to an order of the
court (h) ) of a cause there
depending ; and by any thing , in short , demonstrating
a
gross want of that
regard
and respect, which when once
courts ofjustice
are deprived of, their authority
(so neces
sary for the
good
order of the kingdom ) is entirely
lost
among the people.
The process of attachment , for these
and the like con
tempts ,
must
necessarily
be
as
ancient
as
the
laws
themselves .
For laws , without
a competent authority to
secure
their administration
from
disobedience and con
tempt , would be vain and
nugatory .
A power
therefore
in the supreme
courts
of justice
to
suppress
any
such
contempt , by an immediate
attachment of the
offender ,
results from the first principles ofjudicial establishments ,
and must be an inseparable attendant upon every superior
tribunal .
Accordingly we find it actually
exercised
as
early
as the annals of our law extend .
And
though
a
very learned author ( ) seems inclined
to derive this pro
cess
from
the
statute of Westm.
2 ,
13 Edw .
1 , c. 39 ,
(which
ordains , that in
case the
process
of the king's
courts
be resisted by the power of any great man , the
sheriff
shall
chastise the resisters by imprisonment
, “ a
quâ non deliberentur sine speciali præcepto domini regis : ”
and if the sheriff himself be resisted , he shall certify to
the courts
the
names of the
principal
offenders ,
their
aiders , consenters , commanders , and favourers , and by a
special writ judicial they shall be attached by their bodies
to
appear
before the
court ,
and if they
be
convicted

thereof they shall be punished
at the
king's
pleasure ,
without any interfering
by any other person whatsoever) ,
yet he afterwards more justly concludes , that it is a part
of the law of the land ; and , as such, is confirmed by the
statute ofmagna carta .
If the contempt be committed in the face of the court ,
the offender may be instantly apprehended and imprisoned ,
at the discretion
of the judge (j) , without
any further
proof or examination .
But in
matters that arise at
a
distance , and of which
the court cannot have so perfect a
knowledge
,
unless by the confession of the party or the
testimony of others , if the judges
upon
affidavit
see
sufficient ground
to suspect
that
a contempt
has been
committed , they either make a rule on the suspected
party
to show cause why an attachment should not issue against
him (k) ; or , in very flagrant
instances of contempt , the
attachment issues in the first instance ( ) ;
as it also does ,
if no sufficient
cause be shown
to discharge ,
and there-
upon the court confirms
and makes absolute the original
rule .
This
process
of attachment
is merely intended
to
bring
the
party into
court :
and , when
there , he must
either
stand committed , or put in bail, in order to answer
upon oath to such interrogatories
as shall be administered
to him , for the better information of the court with respect
to the circumstances
of the contempt .
These interroga-
tories
are in the nature
of a charge or accusation , and
must by the course
of the
court be exhibited within the
first four days (m) : though if any interrogatory
be im-
proper , the
defendant may refuse to answer it, and move
the court to have it struck out (n ). If the party can clear
himself upon
oath , he is
discharged ;
but , if perjured ,
may be prosecuted for the perjury (o). If he
confesses
the contempt , the
court will proceed
to correct him by

fine ,
or imprisonment , or both (p) ;
and if he wilfully
and
obstinately
refuses to
answer ,
or
answers
in
an
evasive manner , he is then
clearly guilty of a high and
repeated contempt , to be punished at the discretion
of the
court .
It cannot have escaped
the attention of the reader , that
this method of making
the defendant answer upon oath to
a criminal
charge,
is not
agreeable to the genius of the
common law ;
and
seems
to have been derived
to
our
courts
of law through
the medium of courts of equity .
For the whole process of a court of equity , in the several
stages of a cause , and finally to enforce its decrees , was ,
till the introduction
of sequestrations , in the nature
of a
process of contempt ; acting
only in personam and not in
rem .
There , however , after the
party in contempt
has
answered the interrogatories , such his
answer may be
contradicted
and
disproved
by affidavits
of the
adverse
party
whereas, in a court of law, the
admission
of the
party to purge himself by oath is more favourable
to his
liberty, though
perhaps
not
less
dangerous
to his con
science
for , if he
clears himself by his
answers , the
complaint
is totally dismissed .
And , with regard to this
singular
mode of trial , thus
admitted
in one particular
instance , I shall
only for the present observe , that
as
the
process by attachment in general appears to be extremely
ancient (9 ) , and
has in more
modern
times been recog
nised
by parliament
(r), so the
method
of
examining
the
delinquent
himself upon
oath with
regard to the
contempt
alleged ,
is
at least
of
as
high
antiquity (s),
and by long and immemorial
usage has become the law
of the land .

prevailed in modern
times , and
caused
much
innovation
on the mode of procedure in criminal
cases , viz . , trial by
jury , known to our customary law.
The summary jurisdiction exercised
by justices
out of
sessions
being
essentially the
creature of
statute ( c) , it
follows that whenever a question arises as to the existence
of such a jurisdiction , or as to the mode in which it should
be exercised, reference must be made to the particular
act of parliament , by virtue
of which
it is
assumed
, nor
must the words
there
found
be strained
or extended
so
as to give jurisdiction beyond
their
ordinary
and natural
signification (d).
The
magisterial
powers
referred
to
are
exercised
at
petty
sessions (e)
or by two
justices
sitting
together ,
which ,
in
fact ,
constitutes
a petty
session,
or by one
justice , the rule being that
an
authority
given by statute
to two justices
cannot
be executed by one , but
that
an
authority
so given
to one justice
may be
executed by a
greater
number .
The
magistrates
at the
metropolitan
police courts and the lord
mayor or
an alderman
of the
city of London , as well as the
stipendiary
magistrates (ƒ),
having
in most
cases
power within
the limits of their
respective jurisdictions to do alone whatever is authorised
to be done by one or more justices (g).

a justice

.
The complaint
having
been duly made or the informa
tion laid
before the justice , he will
issue
a
summons
stating shortly the
matter
of such information
or com
plaint, and
requiring
the
attendance
before
him
of the
person
named therein
as defendant , and this
summons
will be served (p) upon the defendant
by a constable , and
if not obeyed
may be followed
up and enforced
by war
rant (q) ; or upon oath or affirmation of due service of the
summons the justice may proceed ex parte to hear
the
information
or complaint , and to adjudicate thereon (r).
Further,
where
an information
has been laid for
an
offence
punishable
on conviction , the justice
before whom
it is laid may , if he think
fit
,
upon
oath
or
affirmation
being made before him substantiating
the matter
of
such
information
,
instead
of
issuing
a
summons
,
issue in the

it has been framed , and if there be
no such
requirement
in the act it may be heard
by a single justice , the com
plainant or informant
being
entitled to conduct
his
case
by counsel
or attorney , and the defendant likewise
being
entitled
to make his
defence
thereto ,
and
to
have
the
witnesses
produced ,
examined
and
cross -examined by
counsel or attorney on his behalf
(x) .
The procedure in case of non -appearance of either party
at the hearing has been thus specially regulated:
1. If at the time and place appointed
for the hearing ,
the defendant do not appear, the justice may , on proof of
service of the summons , proceed
to hear and determine the
case in the
defendant's
absence , or if he think fit may
issue
a
warrant
for
his apprehension ,
and
adjourn
the
hearing
until it has
been
executed
,
and the
defendant
when apprehended under such warrant may be committed to
prison , and ordered to be brought up before the justice at
a certain
time
and place, of which
the
complainant
or
informant
is to have due notice (y).
2. If, at the time and place appointed for the hearing ,
the
defendant attend , but the
complainant
or informant
do not appear, the justice
may dismiss
the
complaint
or
information
, unless for some reason he think proper upon
terms to adjourn
the hearing
to another
day, in which
latter
case
the
defendant
may , in the interim , be com
mitted to prison , or may be discharged on
entering into
recognizances for his re-appearance (y).
3. If both parties are present at the hearing , the sub
tices ; and after the case has been so
heard
and
determined
one justice
may issue
a warrant
of distress or
commitment
thereon .
Further it is
not necessary
that the justice
who
so acts
before
or after the
hearing
should be the justice
or
one of the
justices
by
whom
the
case was
heard
and determined .
But where
by statute
it is required
that
any
information
or complaint
shall
be
heard
and
determined
by
two
or
more justices , or
that a conviction
or
order shall be made by two or
more justices , such justices
must be
present and
acting
together during
the whole
of the hearing

committed
to prison , the execution will be withdrawn
or
the defendant will be discharged
from custody (s).
To
many
statutory
provisions
conferring
summary
powers of conviction upon justices
of the peace , reference
has heretofore been made , of which may be particularised
those sections of the Criminal
Law Consolidation
and
Amendment
Acts , which
empower them thus
summarily
to deal with assaults
(t) , petty larcenies (u ) , and malicious
injuries to property (x).
Reference has also been made to
the jurisdiction
of magistrates over a class of comparatively
trivial
offences
such as drunkenness , vagrancy , and the
like , which
were formerly
within the
cognizance of the
Court leet (y) .
To what has been before said upon
this
subject
we may
add
that any
person
aiding , abetting ,
counselling
or procuring
the
commission of an
offence
punishable
on
summary
conviction , may be
proceeded
against and convicted
for the same , either with the prin-
cipal offender , or before
or after
his
conviction , and is
liable on conviction to the same forfeiture and punishment
as the principal offender (≈).
But
although , as shown in the preceding pages , it has
been found
inexpedient if not
altogether
impossible
to
resort to a jury for the trial of every petty delinquent , and
although it is
especially
desirable
that
speedy justice
should , in cases
such as have
been
adverted to , be
done,
various
modes of setting
right magisterial
errors
have
been afforded , viz . , 1. by appeal to the quarter
sessions
;
2. by certiorari ; or, 3. by stating
a special case-with
a
view
to
obtaining
the judgment of a higher tribunal
;
and , 4.
where
the
commitment
is faulty or illegal , by
habeas corpus.

which is usually
to the
quarter -sessions ,
lies
only in
virtue of express
enactment (b) , and
where
given
the
justice is by some
statutes
required
to make known to
the
defendant
the right to appeal which he possesses
(c) .
At the hearing of the
appeal the magistrates
are bound
to receive
fresh
evidence
, although
not
tendered before
the convicting justice (d) .
The practice in regard to appeals is now mainly
regu-
lated by the 12 & 13 Vict . c . 45, of which the 11th section
enacts
that at any time
after notice given
of appeal to
sessions the parties may , by consent and order of a judge
of one of the superior courts , state the facts in the form
of a special case for the opinion
of such court , by whose
judgment the parties will be bound .
2.
The defendant has in general a right to remove the
conviction
into the court of queen's bench by certiorari ,
which, being
a beneficial writ for the subject , cannot be
taken away without
express words (e) , the rule being
that
" although
a certiorari
lies
unless
expressly taken away,
yet
an appeal
does
not lie
unless
expressly
given
by
statute "(ƒ).
Upon a certiorari
the conviction
of the magistrate
is
removed into the superior court , but there is not
(as upon
an appeal ) any re-hearing of the evidence
or merits ; the
court
looking
only to the
form of the
conviction , and
gathering
from
that whether
or not the party
has been
is to
be
made
for which
no
fee
is
payable , and
the
conviction
or
order must afterwards
be drawn
up
in proper form , and lodged with the
clerk of the
peace
to be by him
filed
among
the
records
of the
general quarter
sessions .

ordinary
methods of proceeding in courts of criminal
jurisdiction ;
which may be distributed
under three general
heads , fol

other in a progressive order : viz . ,
1st . Pro

2ndly . The trial .
3rdly . Pro

after

heads

prehended to be taken before
a justice of the peace to be
by him
examined
and
proceeded
against
according
to
law (c) : it extends all over the kingdom
: and is tested ,
or dated , " England ,"
not " Oxfordshire ," " Berks ," or
other particular county .
Most commonly ,
however ,
a warrant
is granted
by a
justice of the peace , whose power to grant it we will con
sider (1) at common law, (2) by statute .
(1.) A justice of the peace may , at common law, issue
his warrant
for
the apprehension
of an offender (d)
in
any
case
where
he has
jurisdiction
over
the
offence
charged , in
order to
compel
the person
accused
to ap
pear before him (e).
And this power extends
at com
mon law to all treasons ,
felonies ,
and
breaches
of the
peace .
Sir Edward
Coke ( ) indeed has laid it down that a
justice of the peace cannot issue a warrant to apprehend a
felon upon bare suspicion , nor till an indictment
has been
actually found (g) : a doctrine
which
sir
Matthew
Hale
has combated with invincible
authority , and strength
of
reason : maintaining
that a justice of the peace
has , irre
spective of statute , power to issue his warrant
to appre
hend
a person
accused
of felony ,
though
not
yet in
dicted ( h)
and that he may also issue a warrant
to ap
prehend a person suspected
of felony , though the original
suspicion
be not in himself, but in the party who
prays
his warrant ; because
the justice
is a competent judge of
the probability
offered
to him of such suspicion .
But he
says , in both cases , it is fitting to examine upon oath the
party requiring
a warrant , as well to ascertain
that there
has been
a felony
or
other
crime
actually
committed ,
without which no warrant should
be granted
;
as also to
prove the cause and probability
of suspecting
the party
against
whom the warrant
is prayed ( ).

was at common law required
to be under the hand and
seal of the justice ,
to set forth the time
and
place of
making it , and the cause for which it was made, and to be
directed to the
constable , or other
peace
officer ,
(or, it
might be , to a private person by name (k) ) , requiring
him
to apprehend and bring up the party for examination (1).
A general
warrant
to apprehend all persons
suspected
,
without
naming
or particularly
describing
any person in
special , was long
since held to be illegal and void for its
uncertainty (m) ; for it is the duty of the magistrate , and
ought not to be left to the officer , to judge of the ground
of suspicion .
And
a warrant
to apprehend all persons ,
guilty of a crime therein specified , is no legal warrant
(n) :

rests , is a fact to

the

it :

(without

suspected
to be guilty of having
committed
any
such
crime or offence
elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of such
justice
is or is
suspected
to be within the limits of his
jurisdiction
, then if the person so charged or complained
against
is not in custody , the justice
may issue
a sum-

the information , and requiring
him to appear before the
justice at a time and place to be therein
mentioned ; and
if after being
served (9) with
the summons the party fail
to appear thereto , a warrant may be issued to bring him
before the justice to answer to the charge (r).
The justice
may also issue a warrant in the first in-
stance
where the charge or complaint
is made in writing
on the oath or affirmation of the
informant
, or some wit-

summons
has

ARREST
WITHOUT

which empower
peace
officers
or even private
persons to
apprehend
without
warrant
under
special circumstances ,
and to what was there said we may add, that (5) an arrest
may thus be made by a private
person
present when any
felony
is
committed , who is
indeed
bound
by law to
arrest the felon ,
on
pain of fine and imprisonment
(e) ,
and may justify breaking
open doors upon following such
felon (f)
and may kill him, provided he cannot be other
wise taken ; though if the person
endeavouring to make
such
arrest be killed , it is murder (g).
Upon probable
suspicion also a private person may arrest a felon , or other
person so suspected
(
) .
But he cannot justify breaking
open doors to do it ; and if either
party kill the other in
the attempt , it is manslaughter , and no
more (i) . It is
no more, because
there is no malicious
design to kill : but
it amounts to so much , because it would be of most per
nicious
consequence, if,
under
pretence
of
suspecting
felony , any private
person might break
open a house, or
kill another ; and also because
such arrest upon suspicion
is barely permitted
by the law , and not enjoined ,
as in
the case of those who
are present when a felony is com
mitted .
As
regards
an
arrest
upon
suspicion
without
warrant , there is , moreover , this distinction
to be noticed
between the cases where it is made by a private individual
and by
a constable ; in order to justify
the
former
in
causing the
imprisonment , he must not only make out a
reasonable ground of suspicion , but he must prove that a
felony has actually
been
committed , whereas a constable ,
having reasonable ground
to suspect
that
a felony
has
been committed , is authorized
to detain the party suspected
until inquiry can be made by the proper authorities

II. The ex-
amination
and com-
mitment.
4.
There is yet another species
of arrest , wherein both
officers and
private men are concerned , and that is, upon
hue and cry raised where a felony
has been committed .
A hue (from huer , to shout )
and cry , hutesium
et clamor ,
is the
old
common law process of pursuing , with horn
and with voice, all felons , and such
as have dangerously
wounded
another (1) .
Hue and
cry (m ) may be
raised
either by precept of a justice of the peace , or by a peace-
officer, or by any private man who knows of a felony ; and
in the prosecution of such hue and cry the constable
and
his attendants have the same powers , protection , and in-
demnification , as if acting
under
the warrant of a justice
of the peace (n) .
But if a man wantonly
or maliciously
raises a hue and cry, without
cause , he shall be punished
as a disturber of the public
peace (0).
In order to encourage the apprehending
of offenders ,
rewards are sometimes bestowed on such as bring them to
justice , under the sanction of divers acts of parliament (p) .
II. The justice before whom a person charged with the
commission of an indictable
offence
appears in obedience
to a summons (g)
or after
arrest
made by any of the
means above mentioned , will proceed to deal with the
accused
in accordance
with the requirements of the statute
law (r) .
The justice will hear and put into writing the
evidence of the witnesses produced against the defendant
given
on
oath
or affirmation
in his
presence (8) —the
accused being
at liberty to put
questions

THE

witness (t) , and when the depositions
have been taken ,
read
over to the witnesses
and duly signed , the accused
will be addressed
by the justice in these words , or to this
effect : " Having heard the evidence, do you wish to say
anything in answer
to the charge ? you are not obliged
to say anything
unless you desire to do so , but whatever
you say will
be taken down in writing, and may be given
in evidence against you upon your trial " (u).
Should the
accused person in answer to the question
thus
addressed
to him desire
to make
a statement , the justice will first
give
him
clearly to understand that " he has nothing
to
hope from
any promise
of favour ,
and
nothing
to fear
from
any threat which may have been holden out to him
to induce him to make any admission
or confession of his
guilt , but that
whatever he shall
then say may be given
in evidence against him upon his trial , notwithstanding
such promise or threat " (x).
The justice will further ask
the defendant whether he desires to call any witness ;
and
if he
shall
thereupon
call or desire to call witnesses , the
justice will, in the presence of the defendant (y), take the
statements on
oath
or affirmation , both on examination
and
cross -examination , of those who may be so called ;
and when put into writing
such depositions will be
read
over to and signed respectively by the witnesses who shall
have been thus examined , and also by the justice
taking
the same . Witnesses
may be compelled to attend and give
evidence
before the justice (~) , in like manner as where the
examination is with a view to summary conviction (a) and

appear between the warrant under which he was
arrested and the evidence adduced against him (d).
When completed , the accused will be either discharged ,
or allowed
to go at large
on bail, or committed (e) , the
prosecutor and witnesses in this latter event being
bound
over in recognizances
respectively to prosecute and give
evidence, and such recognizances with the depositions , of
which the prisoner is entitled to a copy (ƒ) , and statement
(if any) of the accused
, will be transmitted
to the
court
in which the trial is to be (g).
Should the justice , however , refuse to commit or to bail
the
accused
when
charged with
any of the following
offences , viz . perjury , subornation
of perjury , conspiracy ,
obtaining property by false pretences , keeping
a gambling
or disorderly
house,
or an indecent assault ; and should
the prosecutor desire to prefer an indictment for the same ,
the justice
will
take the
recognizance
of the prosecutor
to
prosecute the
said
charge
or
complaint ,
and
will
transmit
such recognizance , together with the information
and depositions ,
to the
court in which the indictment

2. It is

with

the
defendant
to bail , on a charge of felony , or assault with
intent to commit
felony , or an attempt to commit it , or
of obtaining
or

aid ,
neglect or breach of duty as a peace
officer, or any mis

allowed out of the county rate (k).
3.
The justice
is required
to admit to bail a defendant
charged
with
any
indictable
misdemeanor
other
than
those above -mentioned (1) .
Subject to the foregoing
regulations
a defendant
may
be bailed
after
he
has
been
committed
to
prison
and
before the commencement of the session at which he is to
be tried (m) , in which
case
a warrant for
his
deliverance
will be sent to the keeper of the gaol (n) .
The duty of a justice of the peace in regard to the taking
of bail is essentially judicial (o). It is incumbent
on him
to take
sufficient
bail to
ensure
the
appearance
of the
accused to take his trial, and as guiding to a determination
on this point, three elements will generally be found im
portant : ( 1) the charge ; (2) the nature of the
evidence
by which it is
supported ; and ,
(3) the
punishment
to
which the defendant would be liable if convicted (p).

bail , the

hardship thus
caused
to the defendant will
be
relieved on
application
to a higher
tribunal , for it is agreed
that the
court (9) of queen's bench
(or
any judge (r) thereof
in
time of vacation ) may bail
for
any crime whatsoever , be
it treason (s) , murder
(t) , or any other
offence , according
to the
circumstances
of the
case (u) .
And
herein
the
wisdom of the law is very manifest .
To allow bail to be
taken commonly for the more serious crimes , would greatly
tend to elude the public
justice
: and yet there are cases ,
though they rarely happen , in which it would be hard and
unjust to
confine a man in prison , though
accused
even
of the greatest offence .
The law has therefore
provided
one court , and only one, which
has
a discretionary
power
of bailing in any
case :
excepting
only ,
even
from
this
high jurisdiction , and of course from all inferior ones , such
persons
as are committed by either house of parliament ,
so long as the session lasts : or such as are committed
for
contempts by any of the queen's superior courts ofjustice (x).
Lastly, under our present
head , the reader will remem-
ber that to refuse or delay to bail any person bailable , is
an offence
against the liberty of the subject, in any magis-
trate , by the common law (y) ;
as well
as by the habeas
corpus act , 31 Car . 2 , c . 2 (2).
And , lest the intention
of
the law should be frustrated
by the justices requiring bail
to a greater amount
than the nature of the case demands ,

bail ought not to be required ; though what
bail shall
be called
excessive
, must be left to the court ,

If the
offence be not bailable , or the party cannot find
bail, he is to be committed to gaol , there to abide till deli
vered by due course of law (b).
But such imprisonment
is
only for safe custody , not for punishment
: therefore in this
dubious
interval
between the commitment
and trial ,
a
prisoner ought to be used with the utmost humanity
; and
neither be loaded with
needless
fetters, nor
subjected to
other hardships than such as are absolutely requisite for the
purpose of confinement only .
The law (it was long since
held ) would not justify the gaoler in fettering
a prisoner ,
unless where he was unruly, or had attempted to escape (c) :
this
being
the
humane
language
of our
ancient law

(2.) The
proceeding by information
.
Informations
are
of two
sorts
first those which are partly at the
suit of
the
sovereign ,
and
partly
at that of
a
subject ;
and
secondly , such
as are only in the
name of the sovereign .
The former are brought upon penal
statutes , which inflict
a penalty upon conviction of the offender , one part to the
use of the crown , and another to the use of the informer ;
and are a sort of qui tam actions (the nature of which was
explained
in
a former volume (ƒ)
) only carried on by a
criminal instead of a civil process.
Informations
exhibited in the name of the queen alone ,
are also of two kinds : first, those which are truly and
properly
her
own suits , and
filed
ex officio
by her
own
immediate
officer , the attorney -general ; secondly , those
in
which ,
though
the
queen
is
the
nominal
prose
cutrix , yet it is at the
relation
of
some
private
person
or common
informer
; and these are filed by the queen's
coroner and attorney in the court of queen's bench , usually
called the master
of the
crown -office , who
is for this
purpose the standing officer of the public .
Prosecutions ,
filed ex officio by the queen's attorney -general , are properly
levelled
at such
great offences , less , however , in
degree
than treason , felony , or misprision of treason , as peculiarly
tend to disturb
or endanger her government , or to molest
or affront her in the regular
discharge of her royal func
tions .
For offences
so high and dangerous , in the punish
ment or prevention of which
a moment's
delay might be
fatal , the law has given to the
crown the power of an
immediate
prosecution ,
without
waiting
for
previous
application
to
any other
tribunal
:
which
power , thus
necessary , not only to the case and safety, but even to the
very existence of the executive magistrate , was originally
reserved in the
great
plan of the
English
constitution ,
wherein provision is wisely
made for the due preservation
of all its parts .

oath (g) of a private subject , is any gross and
notorious
misdemeanor , riot, battery , libel , or
other im
morality of an atrocious kind ( ) , not peculiarly
tending
to disturb the government (for any such is left to the care
of the
attorney
general ) ,
but
which ,
on account of
its
magnitude
or
pernicious
example
,
deserves
the
most
public animadversion
.
Upon motion made for
a
criminal
information
the court
will take into
consideration all the various
circumstances
of the charge
,
before they lend their sanction
to
this extra
ordinary mode
of
prosecution
.
They will observe
the time
of
making
the
application
,
whether
a
long interval
has
elapsed since the alleged wrong
,
and
if
so
to
what cause
it
may fairly
be
ascribed
;
they will examine the
evidence
on which
the
charge
is
founded
,
and will consider the
character
and
motives
of
the applicant
in
regard
to
the
matter
before them
;
and they will look forward
to
the
consequences
of
the
rule
which
they
are
requested
to
grant and the peculiar situation
of
the defendant
().
In
support of an application
of
this nature for
a
libel
,
the
applicant
must
,
unless
the
charge be
so
general
as
to
make
it
impossible
,
show his
innocence
of
the matter
imputed
to
him
(k),
and where the motion for
a
criminal
information
is
made against
a
magistrate
for anything
done
in
the execution
of
his
office
,
an imputation
of
cor
rupt

vindictive
motives must be made
(1),

notice
of
the intended application must
be
given

PROCEEDINGS

THE TRIAL .
it will be sent down by writ of nisi prius into the county
where the offence
is charged to have been committed , and
will be there tried
by a common
or special jury, like
a
record in a civil
action ; and if the defendant
is found
guilty, he will afterwards receive
judgment
from the court
of queen's bench (n).
There can be no doubt but that this mode of prosecution
by information
(or
suggestion ) ,
filed
on record
by
the
queen's attorney -general , or by her coroner
or master of
the crown -office in the court of queen's bench , is as ancient
as the common law itself (0).
For as the crown was bound
to prosecute ,
or
at least
to
lend
the sanction
of its
name to a prosecutor , whenever
a grand jury informed
it upon their oaths that
there was a sufficient ground for
instituting a criminal
suit :
so , when these its immediate
officers were otherwise sufficiently
assured
that a man had
committed a gross misdemeanor , either personally
against
the sovereign or government , or against
the public
peace
and good order , they were at liberty , without
waiting
for
any further intelligence , to convey that information
to the
court held in theory coram
rege by a suggestion
on record ,
and to carry on the prosecution in the sovereign's name.
But these informations
(of either kind ) are
confined by
our constitutional
law to misdemeanors only : for , where-
ever any felony is charged , the same law requires that the
accusation be warranted by the oath of twelve men before
the party shall
be put to answer it.
And ,
as to those
offences , in which informations
were
allowed
as well as
indictments , so long
as they
were confined
to this high
and respectable jurisdiction, and were carried on in a legal
and regular course in the highest
criminal tribunal , the
subject
had
no
reason to
complain .
The same
notice
was given , the
same
process
was
issued, the same pleas
were allowed , the
same
trial by jury was had , the same
judgment was given by the same judges , as if the prose-

cution had originally
been
by indictment .
But when the
statute
3 Hen . 7, c .
1 , had extended the jurisdiction of the
court of star-chamber, the members of which were the sole
judges of the law, the fact , and the penalty ; and when the
statute
11 Hen. 7, c. 3 , had permitted an information
to be
brought by
any
informer
upon
any
penal
statute ,
not
extending to life or member , at the assizes or before the
justices of the peace , who were to hear and determine the
same according to their own
discretion
; then it was , that
the legal and
orderly jurisdiction of the
court of king's
bench
fell into
disuse
and
oblivion ,
and
Empson
and
Dudley (the wicked
instruments of king Henry VII . ) by
hunting out obsolete penalties , and this
tyrannical
mode
of prosecution , with other oppressive devices (p), continu-
ally harassed the
subject , and
shamefully
enriched
the
crown.
The latter of these acts was soon indeed repealed
by statute
1
Hen . 8 , c. 6 , but the court of star-chamber
continued in high vigour , and daily increasing
its
authority
,
for more than
a
century longer
;
till finally abolished by
statute 16 Car
.

c.

.
Upon this
dissolution
of
the
star
-
chamber
the
old
common law
(q)
authority
of
the court
of
queen's
bench
,
as
the custos
morum
of
the nation
,
being
found necessary
to
reside somewhere for the
peace
and good government
of
the kingdom
,
was again revived
in
practice
(r).
And
it
is
observable
,
that
in
the
same
act
of
parliament
which
abolished
the
court
of
star
-
chamber
,
a
conviction by in-
formation
is
expressly
reckoned
up
,
as
one
of
the legal
modes
of
conviction
of
such persons
as
should
offend
a

against
the provisions
of
that statute

of such his dislike was probably
the
ill
use which the
master
of
the crown
-
office then made
of
his authority
,
by
permitting
the
subject
to
be
harassed with
vexatious
informations
,
whenever
applied
to
by any malicious
or
revengeful prosecutor
;
rather than any doubt being enter-
tained by him
of
their
legality
,
or
propriety upon urgent
occasions
(u).
For the power
of
filing
informations
,
without any
control
,
then
resided
in
the
breast
of
the
master
,
and being filed
in
the name
of
the king
,
they sub-
jected the prosecutor
to
no
costs
,
though
on trial
they
proved
to
be groundless
.
This oppressive use
of
them
,
in
the
times
preceding
the
revolution
,
occasioned
a
struggle
,
soon after the
accession
of
king William
(x),
to
procure
a
declaration
of
their illegality by the judgment
of
the court
of
king's bench
.
But Sir John Holt
,
who then
presided there
,
and all the judges
,
were clearly
of
opinion
that this
proceeding was grounded
on the
common
law
,
and could not
be
then impeached
.
And
,
in
a
few years

,
a
more temperate remedy was supplied

To this end the sheriff of
each
county is bound
to return
to
every session of the
peace , and every commission of oyer and terminer , and of
general gaol delivery , twenty -four good and lawful men of
the county , to inquire , present , do, and execute all those
things , which on the part of our lady the queen shall then
and there be commanded
them (k).
They
need
not
be
freeholders (1) , though they usually
are so , and gentlemen ,
moreover , of the best figure in the county (m ).
As many
as appear upon this panel are sworn upon the grand jury ,
to the amount of twelve at the least , and not more than
twenty -three ;
that
twelve ( n ) may be a majority .
And
it may be worthy
of remark
that in the time of king
Richard
the First (according
to
Hoveden ) the
process
of
electing
the
grand
jury
ordained
by
that
prince ,
was
as
follows
:
four
knights
were to be
taken
from
the county
at large , who
chose
two more
out of
every
hundred ; which two associated to themselves ten
other
principal
freemen , and those twelve were
to answer
con-
cerning
all
particulars
relating
to their
own
district .
This number was probably found
too large and inconve-
nient ;
but
traces of this institution
remained
until the
passing of the statute 6 Geo . 4 , c . 50, in that some of the
jury must
have been summoned
out of every hundred .
(i ) In R. v. Jolliffe , 4 T. R. 293,
Buller, J. , says, " If to
an
action
for slander in charging
the plaintiff
with
felony
a
justification
be
pleaded , which is
found
by
the
jury , that of itself amounts to an in-

This grand jury are previously instructed in the articles of
their inquiry, by a charge from
the judge who
presides
upon the bench .
They then withdraw, to sit and receive
indictments , which are preferred
to them in the name of
the sovereign , but at the
suit of any private
prosecutor ;
and they are only to hear evidence on behalf of the prose
cution (p) ; for the finding of
an
indictment
is
in the
nature of an inquiry or accusation , which
is afterwards to
be tried and determined
; and the grand jury are merely
to
inquire
upon
their
oaths , whether
there
be
sufficient
cause
to call upon the party
to answer it.
A grand jury ,
however , ought to be persuaded of the truth of an indict
ment so far as the evidence submitted to them goes
; and
not to rest satisfied with remote probabilities
: a doctrine
that might be applied
to very oppressive purposes (q).
Although
criminal
procedure in this
country
usually
commences with the inquiry before a magistrate
already
noticed , it is at common law the right of any
private
person to prefer a bill of indictment to a grand jury against
another
for any crime .
This right has, however , in some
important
particulars
been
restricted
and
modified
by
recent statutes , for as regards perjury , subornation of per
jury , conspiracy , obtaining
property
by false
pretences
,
keeping a gambling
or
a disorderly
house , or committing
an indecent
assault ,
no bill of indictment
can
now be
preferred for any such offence
unless the prosecutor
has
been bound by recognizance
to prosecute or give evidence
against the accused , or unless the accused
has been com
mitted , or has been bound over to appear to answer to an
indictment , or unless the bill be preferred with the sanc
tion of a judge or of the attorney or solicitor -general , or ,
in the case of bribery , of some person authorized

The
habeas

act indeed provides , that any person
committed for treason or felony must
be indicted
in the
ensuing term or sessions , or the suspected party must
be
bailed , unless it be shown upon
oath, that the witnesses
for the prosecution could not be produced at the preceding
session (x).
But this regulation
applies only to persons
confined upon suspicion , and is solely intended to prevent
the protracting
of arbitrary
imprisonment
;
so that it does
not preclude the crown from preferring
an indictment
at
any distance of time from the actual
perpetration
of the
offence , unless some particular
statute limits the time of
prosecuting .
Definite
periods of limitation

for a felony or misdemeanor
committed upon any person ,
or on or in respect of any property , in or upon any carriage
employed in any journey , or on board any vessel employed
in any voyage upon
any navigable
river , canal , or inland

A forger
may be tried
either
in the county or place
where the offence
was committed , or in that where he is
apprehended
or
in
custody (≈) .
And
where
a person
utters
counterfeit
coin in any county or jurisdiction , and
other counterfeit
coin in any other county or jurisdiction
on the
same day , or within ten days next
ensuing ,
or
where two or more such offenders have acted in concert in
different
counties or jurisdictions
, the venue may be laid
and the offence
charged to have been committed
in any
one of those counties or jurisdictions
(a) .
In an indictment
for libel , or for sending a threatening
letter , the venue
may be laid either in the county from
which
it was sent ,
or
in that in which the prosecutor
received it (b).
In an indictment
for bigamy , the venue
may be laid either in the
county where the offender was
apprehended
or is in custody (c) , or in that in which
the
second marriage
took
place ; and on an indictment
for
returning
from
transportation , or being illegally at large
before
the
expiration
of
a term of penal
servitude , the
offender may be tried either in the county whence he was
ordered to be transported or kept in penal servitude , or in
that where he was apprehended (d) .
Lastly, where the

therein ,
no

PROCEEDINGS
BEFORE
THE
TRIAL .
.
When the grand jury have heard the evidence , if they
think
the
accusation
groundless ,
they used formerly to
indorse
on the back of the bill, " ignoramus ;"
or, we
know nothing
of it ;
intimating, that
though
the
facts
might possibly
be true ,
that truth did
not
appear
to
them
but now , they assert in English , more absolutely ,
" no true bill ;" and then the party is discharged without
further
answer .
But
a
fresh
bill
may
afterwards
be
preferred to a subsequent grand jury .
If, on the other hand , the grand jury are satisfied of the
truth of the accusation , they then indorse
upon
the bill ,
" a true bill ;" anciently , " billa vera ."
The indictment is
then said to be found , and the party stands indicted .
But
to find a bill there must at least twelve of the jury agree :
for so tender is the law of England
of the life or liberty of
the
subject , that no man
can
be
convicted
at suit of
the crown of any indictable
offence , unless by the unani
mous voice of twenty -four of his
equals and neighbours
:
that is, by twelve
at least of the grand jury , in the first
place, assenting to the accusation ; and afterwards , by the
whole petit jury , of twelve more , finding him guilty , upon
his trial .
But if twelve of the grand jury assent , it is a
good presentment , though
some of the rest disagree (4) .
And
the
indictment , when
found , is publicly
delivered
into court.
The indictment
must have a precise and sufficient
cer
tainty ( ) , and must contain such a description of the crime
charged- 1st . That
the
defendant
may know what it is
that
he is
called
upon to answer ; 2ndly . That the jury
may appear to be satisfied in their conclusion of " guilty "
or " not guilty " upon the premises delivered
to them ;
3rdly . That the court may see such a definite
crime
that
they may apply to it the punishment which the
law pre
scribes ( ).
Of these reasons-all weighty and unanswer

able-the first is perhaps the strongest .
The convenience
of mankind
imperatively
demands-and in furtherance of
that
convenience
it is part of the
duty
of those
who
administer justice to require-that
the charge should
be
specifically set forth in the indictment ,
in
order
that
notice may thus be given to the accused
person of what he
is to come prepared
to answer , and to prevent his being
distracted -amidst
the
confusion
of a multifarious
and
complicated
transaction , parts of which only are meant to
be impeached (7) .
The
offence
itself, whether
existing
at
common
law
or constituted
by statute , must therefore be set forth with
clearness
and
certainty
;
so
that
in
the
one
case
the
essential
ingredients
in it may be apparent , and in the
other
the
material
words
used by the
legislature
in
describing it may be exhibited .
In setting forth some
crimes , moreover , particular
words of art must
be
used ,
which
are
so
appropriated
by our law to
express
the
precise
idea which it entertains
of the
offence
charged ,
that no other words , however synonymous they may seem ,
are accounted capable of doing it.
Thus , in treason , the
facts must be laid to be done by the accused " traitorously
and
against
his
allegiance ;"
anciently , " proditorie
et
contra ligeantiæ
suæ
debitum
:"
else
the
indictment
is
void .
In indictments
for murder , it is necessary to say
that the party
indicted
" murdered ,"
not " killed " or
"slew," the
other ;
which
was
formerly
expressed in
Latin by the word
" murdravit ."
In an indictment
for
felony , the
adverb " feloniously ," "felonice ,"
must
be
used ; and for burglary , also " burglariter ," or in English ,
" burglariously
: " and these to ascertain the intent .
In
an indictment for rape, the word " rapuit," or " ravished ,"
is
necessary ,
and
must
not be
expressed
by any peri-
phrasis ; in order to render the crime certain .
So in an
indictment
for larceny , the words " felonice cepit
et aspor-
(1) R. v. Perrott , 2 M. & S. 386.


410
PROCEEDINGS
BEFORE
THE TRIAL.
tacit," " feloniously took and carried away," are necessary ;
for these only can express the very offence of stealing .
Further, the indictment
must
state the facts of the
crime with as much certainty
as the nature of the case will
admit (m).
And
the
offence charged therein
must be
positively averred , not
stated by way of recital (n ) or in
the disjunctive
(o).
Repugnancy , moreover , in a material
matter , may be fatal to the indictment (p).
Again, it is a well founded rule that there must be on
the face of every indictment
a distinct intimation to the
person to be tried whether
the
offence
with which
he
stands
charged
is
a felony
or a
misdemeanor .
The
indictment
for a felony therefore
must allege that the act
charged was done " feloniously " (1).
Neither
should
a count
for
felony
be joined with a
count
for misdemeanor in the indictment
; nor
should
criminal acts
separate from
each
other
and distinct in
kind though referable , may be , to the same general class
of felonies
or misdemeanors , be joined
in the same in
dictment (r).
A joinder of counts in an indictment
may , however ,
sometimes be proper , and
is in certain
cases
expressly
allowed by statute.
Thus , in an indictment
for larceny ,
several counts may be inserted for distinct
acts of stealing ,
not exceeding three, which may have been committed
by
the
accused against
the same person within the space of
(m) R. v. Hollond , 5 T. R.
611,
et seq.
Therefore ,
an
indictment
charging
the
defendant
with
ob
taining money by false
pretences ,
without stating
what were the par
ticular pretences , is insufficient . (R.
v. Mason , 2 T. R. 581. )
There are,
however ,
some
exceptions
to the
above general rule .

Colledge , by Sir John
Hawles ,
Solicitor-General
under
William III.
(8

read, two capital
crimes of different
natures , as murder
and robbery , or
treason
and
misdemeanor ,
cannot
be joined in
one indictment.

six months from the first to the last of such acts , and the
prosecutor
may proceed
thereon for all or any of them (s).
So
a count
for feloniously
receiving
property
knowing
it to have
been
stolen , may be joined with
a count for
stealing the same property (t) .
The rule which
requires
certainty
in
an
indictment
having
been
so strictly applied
as
often
to
defeat the
ends of justice ,
some useful
statutory
provisions
have
been enacted whereby the frame of the indictment , as well
generally
as in regard
to various
specific
offences ,
has
been much abbreviated and simplified .
No indictment
is
now held insufficient
for want of the averment of matter
unnecessary to be proved , nor for the omission
of various
words and phrases which have usually found place therein ,
nor for omitting
to state the
time at which
the offence
charged was committed , in any case where time is not of
the essence of the offence , nor for want of the
statement.
of the value or price of anything or the amount of damage ,
injury , or spoil in any case where not essential to the con-
stitution of the particular
offence (u).
Variances between
the allegations in the indictment
and the proofs
adduced
at the trial , are ,
as shown in the
next chapter , in many
cases
amendable , and
any
objection
to the
indictment
grounded
upon defect of form must , if at all , be taken
at the proper time (x).
In an indictment
for murder
or
manslaughter , or for being an accessory
to either of these
offences , it is
no longer
necessary,
as formerly , to set
forth the
manner
in which
or the means by which
the
death
of the
deceased
was
caused (y) , the
indictment
for felonious
homicide (2) thus
being rendered brief and

or embezzlement

As
during the
continuance
of this custom , a pro
cess was
certainly
given , for reco
vering the weregild by the party to
whom it was
due ; it seems
that ,
when
offences by degrees grew no
longer
redeemable , the private pro
cess was still continued , in order to
insure
the infliction of punishment
upon
the
offender ,
though
the
party injured was allowed
no pecu
niary compensation
for the offence .
Although an appeal was thus in
the nature of a prosecution
for some
atrocious
injury
committed
more
immediately
against
an individual ,
yet was
one subject
also anciently
permitted
to appeal another
subject
of high treason , either in the courts
of common law (Britt . c. 22), or in
parliament ,
or
(for

(g) Until the stat. 59
Geo. 3, c.
46, another
such
method
existed
called
an
appeal (derived
from the
French " appeller " the verb active ,
which signifies
to call upon , sum
mon ,
or
challenge
one ;
and not
the verb neuter , which signifies the
same as the ordinary
sense of " ap
peal " in English). An appeal when
spoken
of as a criminal
prosecu
tion, denoted an accusation by one
private
subject
against another , for
some
heinous
crime
;
demanding
punishment
on account of the
par
ticular injury suffered , rather
than
for the offence against the public .
This private
process , for the pu
nishment of public
crimes , had pro
bably
its
origin in
those
times
when
a private
pecuniary
satisfac
tion, called
a weregild , was paid to
the party injured , or
his relations ,
to
expiate
any
enormous
offence .
This was a custom derived to us, in
common with other northern

mitted
beyond
the
seas) in the
court of the high constable and mar
shal ; and so late as 1631 there was
a trial by battle
awarded
in
the
court of chivalry, on such an appeal
of treason .
(By Donald
Lord
Rea
against
David
Ramsey .
(Rushw .
vol. 2, pt. 2, p . 112.).) The appeal of
high treason in the Courts
of Com
mon
Law was virtually
abolished
(1 Hale, P. C. 349) by the
stats . 5
Edw. 3, c. 9, and
25 Edw. 3, c. 24,
and in
parliament
was
expressly
abolished
by stat . 1 Hen . 4, c. 14.
So that the only appeal
afterwards
in force was in respect of felony and
mayhem
done within the realm .
An appeal of felony
might have
been brought for a crime committed
either
against the party himself , or
his
relations , ex. gr.,
for
larceny ,
mayhem ,
and
arson ,
committed
against
the
party,
and
for
the
murder or manslaughter
of his re
lation .
But this
could
not
have
been brought
by
every
relation
:
but only by the wife
for the
death
of her husband , or by the heir for
the death of his ancestor (Mirr . c. 2,
s. 7).
The
appeal
might
have
been
brought
previous
to an indictment
;
and if the appellee were
acquitted
thereon ,he could not have been after
wards indicted
for the same offence.
If moreover the appellee were ac
quitted , the appellor
(by virtue of
the stat . of Westm. 2, 13 Edw. 1, c.
12)
suffered
one
year's
imprison
ment , and paid a fine to the crown ,
besides restitution
of damages to the
party for
the
imprisonment
and
infamy which
he
had
sustained ;
and , if the appellor
were incapable
to
make
restitution
, his
abettors
were to do it for him, and also were
liable
to imprisonment
.
This
pro
vision ,
as
was
forescen
by
the
author
of Fleta
(1. 1, c. 34, s. 48)
proved
a great
discouragement
to
appeals : so that thenceforward
they
ceased to be in common use.
If the appellee were found guilty,
he suffered
the
same judgment
as
if he had been convicted
by indict
ment
but
with this
remarkable
difference ; that on
an indictment ,
the crown might pardon and remit
the execution
; on an appeal , being
at the suit of a private
subject , to
make an atonement
for the private
wrong , the crown could not
pardon
it (2 Hawk . P.
C. 392).
Though
the
punishment
of the
offender
might be remitted
and
discharged
by the concurrence of all parties in
terested ; and
as the crown by par
don might frustrate
an indictment ,
so the appellant
by his release might
discharge
an appeal (1 Hale, P. C.
nam quilibet potest renunciare
juri, pro se introducto ."
This latter
kind of appeal was abolished
by the
59
Geo. 3, c. 46, the last
instance
of an appeal of murder
having
oc
curred , A.D. 1818 (Ashton v. Thorn
ton, 1 B. & Ald . 405).

I. Process
on Indict-
ment.
CHAPTER
XIX.
THE
TRIAL .
THE proceedings at a criminal trial , which
next
claim
our attention , may be arranged under the following heads ,
viz . :-I.
Process
on the indictment
; II. Arraignment
and
its
incidents
; III.
Plea
or
demurrer
; IV.
The
mode of trial ; V. Jury Process ; VI. The right of chal-
lenge ; VII . The production
and marshalling
of evidence ;
VIII . The verdict ; and IX. The sentence with its
con-
comitants .
We
shall
treat
these
heads
seriatim
in the
order indicated .
I.
The
indictment
having
been
found
by the grand
jury , we are to inquire into the manner of issuing
process
for bringing in the accused
to answer it.
If, indeed , the
offender were in custody before the finding of the
indict-
ment , he is
immediately
(or
as
soon
as
convenience
permits ) to be arraigned thereon.
But if he has fled , or
secretes
himself, or has not been bound
over to appear
at the assizes
or sessions , still an indictment
may be pre-
ferred
against
him in his absence
: since , were
he pre-
sent, he could not be heard before the grand jury against
it.
And , if it be found , then process
must issue to bring
him into court ; for the indictment
cannot be tried , unless
the defendant personally
appears
: according to the rules
of equity in all cases , and the express provision of statute
28 Edw. 3, c. 3 , in capital
ones , that
no man
shall
be
put to death , without
being
brought
to answer by due
process oflaw.
The ordinary method of compelling
the appearance of a


PROCESS
ON INDICTMENT
.
415
defendant
against whom
an indictment
has
been
found ,
is now provided by the statute 11 & 12 Vict . c. 42, s. 3.
It enacts , that where an indictment
has thus been found
in any court of oyer and terminer or general gaol delivery ,
or of general or quarter
sessions
of the
peace , against a
person still at large , whether such person has been bound
by recognizance
to appear to answer to the same or not,
the clerk of indictments
or clerk of the peace , as the case
may be, at such court or sessions, shall
at any time after
the end of the then
sessions, upon
application
of the
prosecutor
, or on his
behalf, if
such person
shall
not
have
already appeared
and pleaded
to the
indictment ,
grant to the prosecutor
a certificate of such indictment
having been found ; and upon production
of such certifi-
cate to a justice of the
peace
for the county , or place in
which the offence
is in such
indictment
alleged
to have
been
committed , or in which
the
person
indicted
shall
reside or be, or be supposed or suspected
to reside or be,
such justice
shall
issue
his
warrant
to
apprehend
the
defendant, and to cause him to be brought
before him, to
be dealt with according to law.
The section further
pro-
vides that if the defendant be thereupon apprehended and
brought before such justice , he shall , upon proof
that the
person
so apprehended is the person charged and named
in such indictment , without
further inquiry or examina-
tion, commit
him for trial, or admit him to bail.
Pro-
visions are contained in this same statute for the backing
of the justice's
warrant when necessary (a) , and for the
detention of the
accused
until he can be removed by writ
of habeas
corpus , if confined in prison
for any
offence
other than that charged in the indictment
at the time of
application
being made to the justice (b).
Irrespective
of the above ordinary procedure , the proper
process for compelling
the appearance of
a defendant
against
whom
an indictment
for misdemeanor
has
been
found , is by writ of venire facias, which is in the nature
(b) S. 3.
(a) S. 11.


416
THE TRIAL .
Outlawry .
of a summons to cause the party to appear.
And if the
return to such venire sets forth that the party has
lands
in the county whereby he may be distrained , then a distress
infinite shall be issued from time to time till he appears .
But if the sheriff
returns
that
he
has
no lands
in his
bailiwick, then (upon his non -appearance) a writ of capias
ad respondendum shall issue , which commands the sheriff
to take his body , and have him at the next assizes
; and
if he cannot be taken upon the first capias , a second
and
a third shall issue , called an alias , and
a pluries capias .
Though
on indictments
for treason or felony , a capias
is
the first process.
A bench warrant will also be granted , signed by ajudge
at the
assizes , or by two justices
at
sessions , to arrest
a
defendant
against whom
an indictment
for misdemeanor
has been found (c) .
And by the stat . 48 Geo . 3 , c. 58 , s. 1,
when
any
person
is charged with
an
offence
below the
degree of felony , a judge may , on an affidavit thereof, or
on certificate of an indictment
or an information
having
been
filed , issue
his
warrant
for apprehending
the de
fendant
and holding
him to bail ; in default
of finding
which, he may be committed .
Where the person against whom an indictment
, whether
for felony
or misdemeanor
has been
found , absconds , or
cannot
be
apprehended
by warrant ,
and it is thought
proper
to
pursue
him to outlawry , great
exactness
is
necessary.
For , in
such
case , after the
several
writs
already
mentioned
have
issued in
a
regular
number ,
according to the
nature
of the
crime , without effect ,
a
writ of exigent will
be
awarded against
the offender
in
order to his outlawry ; that is, he will be exacted , pro
claimed , or required
to surrender , at five county courts ;
and if he be returned quinto exactus, and does not
appear
at the fifth exaction
or requisition , then he is adjudged
to be outlawed , or put out of the protection of the law ;
so
(c) 1 Chitt . Cr. L. 339.


CERTIORARI
.

that he is
incapable of taking
the benefit of it in
any
respect , either by bringing a civil action or otherwise .
The
punishment
for
outlawry
upon
indictment
for
a misdemeanor , is the same as for outlawry in a civil action
(of which we spoke in the preceding
Book (d) ) ; viz . ,
forfeiture
of
goods
and
chattels .
But
an
outlawry
in
treason
or felony amounts to a conviction
and attainder
of the offence charged in the indictment
, as much
as if
the
offender had
been found
guilty by his country (e) .
His life is , however , still under the protection of the law,
as formerly
observed (f) :
so that though
anciently
an
outlawed felon was said to have caput lupinum , and might
be knocked
on the head like
a wolf, by any
one who
should meet him (g) ;
because , having renounced all law ,
he was to be dealt with
as in a state of nature , when
every one that should find him might slay him : yet now ,
to
avoid
such inhumanity , it has
been
holden
that
no
man
is entitled to kill him wantonly
or wilfully ; but , in
so doing is guilty of murder ( ) , unless it happens in the
endeavour to apprehend
him ( ) .
For any person may
arrest
an outlaw on
a criminal
prosecution , either of his
own head , or by writ or warrant
of capias utlagatum, in
order to bring him to execution .
Outlawry
may , how
ever , be reversed by writ of error ; and the proceedings
therein
being
(as it is
fit
they
should
be
)
exceedingly
nice
and
circumstantial
,
if
any single
minute
point
be
omitted
or
misconducted
,
the whole
outlawry
is
illegal
,
and
may be
reversed
:
upon
which
reversal
the
party
accused
is
admitted
to
plead
to

" Moreover , where proceedings
are taken
against
any person for
having in his possession stolen goods , evidence may be given

such
evidence
may be taken
into
consideration
for
the purpose of proving

spoke (k) ,

had (1) ,
to
certify
and
remove
the
indictment , with all
the proceedings
thereon , from
an
inferior
court of
criminal
jurisdiction into the court
of
queen's bench ; which is the sovereign
ordinary
court
of
justice
in
causes
criminal.
And this is frequently
done
for one of these four
purposes ;
either ,
1. To
consider
and determine the validity of an indictment
and the pro
ceedings thereon ; and to quash or confirm them
as there
is
cause
:
or , 2. Where
it is surmised that a partial
or
insufficient trial will probably
be had in the court below ,
the indictment
is removed , in order to have the prisoner
or defendant
tried
at bar , or before the justices
of nisi
prius : or, 3. It is
so removed , in order to plead there a
pardon from the crown : or , 4. To issue process
of outlawry
against
the offender , in those counties
or
places
where
the process of the inferior judges will not reach him ( m ).
Such writ of certiorari , when
issued and delivered to the
inferior
court for removing
any record or other proceed
ing , as well upon
indictment
as otherwise , supersedes
the
jurisdiction of such inferior
court , and makes all subse
quent proceedings
therein entirely erroneous and illegal ;
unless the court
of queen's bench remands the record to
the court below , to be there
tried
and determined .
A
certiorari
may be granted
at the instance of either
the
prosecutor or the defendant ; though it is in the discretion
of the court to grant or refuse the writ (n ).
Costs , more
over, are now payable by the defendant or the prosecutor
in case respectively of conviction or of acquittal incurred
subsequently to the removal of the indictment (o).

also it is, that an indict

or is

he
is
immediately

is
the
fifth stage
of

.

is
nothing
else
but
to
call the prisoner
to
the bar of the court
,
to
answer the matter
charged
upon
him
in
the indictment
(r).
The
prisoner
is
to
be
called
to
the bar by his name
;
and
it
is
laid down in our
ancient books
(s),
that he must
be
brought
to
the bar
without irons
,
or
any manner
of
shackles
or
bonds
;
unless
there
be evident
danger
of
an
escape
,
and then he may
be
secured
with irons
.
And although
,
in
Layer's case
,
A.D.

,
a
difference was taken
between the time of
arraignment
,
and the time
of
trial
;
and accordingly the
prisoner stood
at
the bar
in
chains during the time
of
his
arraignment
(t);
and although
it
has since
been
held
,
that the court has no authority
to
order the irons
to
be
taken off
,
till the
prisoner
has pleaded
,
and the jury are
charged
to
try
him

THE
TRIAL .
1. Standing
mute.
The
prisoner
when
brought
to the bar was
formerly
called upon by name to hold up his hand : which , though
apparently a trifling circumstance , was of this significance ,
that by the holding
up of his
hand constitit de personâ ,
and the prisoner
owned himself to be of that
name by
which he was
called (x).
However ,
this
was
not
an
indispensable
ceremony, and is now disused.
The indict-
ment is, however , to be read to the prisoner distinctly in
the English
tongue (which was law, even while
all other
proceedings were in Latin ) , that he may fully understand
the charge against him.
After which it is to be demanded
of him , whether
he be guilty of the
crime
whereof he
stands indicted , or not guilty.
When
a prisoner
is
arraigned ,
he
either ,
1.
Stands
mute ; or, 2.
Confesses the fact ; which circumstances we
may call incidents to the arraignment
: or else , 3. he pleads
to the indictment, which is to be considered
as another
stage of the proceedings .
But , first , let us observe
these
incidents
to the arraignment , of standing
mute , or con-
fession .
1. Regularly a prisoner is said to stand mute , when ,
being
arraigned , he either ( 1. ) Makes
no answer at all ;
or (2. ) Answers
foreign
to
the
purpose ,
or
with
such
matter as is not allowable
; and will not answer otherwise .
If the
prisoner
says
nothing, the court ought forth-
with to
impanel
a jury
to inquire ,
1st ,
whether
the
prisoner be mute of malice , or by the visitation
of God ;
if the latter , then , 2ndly , whether
he is able
to
plead ;
and lastly , whether he is sane or not ; on which issue the
question
is , whether
he is of sufficient
intellect
to com-
prehend the course of the proceedings on the trial , so
as
to be able to make a proper defence (y).
Formerly if the
accused
were found
to be obstinately

P. 303, 305, n.

course
to be taken
where
the
prisoner
is
deaf and dumb , but can read , see R.
v. Thompson , 2 Lewin , C. C. 137.


ARRAIGNMENT
,
AND
ITS
INCIDENTS .
421
mute (which
a prisoner was held to be who had cut out
his own tongue (2) ) , then , on
an
indictment
of high
treason , such standing
mute was equivalent
to a convic
tion , and was followed by the same
judgment
and execu
tion (a).
And as in this the highest crime , so also in the
lowest
species
of felony ,
viz . petty larceny ,
and in all
misdemeanors , standing
mute was always
equivalent to
conviction .
But upon indictments
for
other felonies , the
prisoner
was
not , by the
ancient law, looked
upon
as
convicted , so
as to receive judgment
for the felony ; but
should ,
for his
obstinacy ,
have
received
the
terrible
sentence of " penance ," or peine (which , as will
appear
presently , was probably
nothing
more than
a corrupted
abbreviation of prisone ) forte et dure.
Before this
was pronounced the prisoner
had not only
trina admonitio, but also a respite of a few hours , and
the
sentence
was distinctly
read to him, that
he might
know his
danger (b) ;
and ,
after
all , if he
continued
obstinate ,
and
his
offence
was
clergyable ,
he
had
the
benefit of his clergy (c) allowed him, even though
he was
too stubborn
to pray it (d).
Thus tender was the law of
inflicting this
dreadful
punishment
; but if
no
other
means
could prevail , and the prisoner (when charged with
a capital felony ) continued stubbornly
mute , the judgment
was then given against him without
any distinction
of sex
or degree .
A judgment, which was purposely ordained to
be exquisitely
severe , that it might rarely be put in exe
cution .
The
rack ,
or
question , to
extort
a
confession
from
criminals , is
a practice
different
in
its nature
from
the
peine forte
et dure ; this having been only used to compel
a man to put himself upon his trial ; that being
a species
of trial in itself.
And the trial by rack is utterly unknown

THE
TRIAL.
to the law of England ; though
once , when the dukes of
Exeter
and Suffolk , and other ministers of Henry VI . had
laid a design to introduce the civil law into this kingdom
as the rule of government , for
a beginning
thereof they
erected
a rack
for torture ; which was called in
derision
the duke of Exeter's
daughter , and still remains in the
tower of London (e) ; where it was occasionally used as an
engine of state, not of law, more than once in the reign of
queen Elizabeth (f).
But when , upon the assassination
of Villiers , duke of Buckingham
, by Felton , it was pro-
posed in the privy council to put the assassin to the rack,
in
order
to discover his
accomplices ; the judges , being
consulted , declared unanimously , to their own honour
and
the honour of the English law, that
no such proceeding
was
allowable
by
the
laws
of
England
( g) .
Though
doubtless ,
torture
was
afterwards
applied
to
state
criminals
on
more than
one occasion during the reign
of Charles I. (h).
It seems
astonishing
that this usage of administering
the
torture , should
be said to arise from a tenderness to
the lives of men : and yet such is the reason given for its
introduction
in the civil law ( ) ; viz .
because
the
laws
cannot endure that any man should die upon the evidence
of a false , or even a single witness ; and therefore contrived
this method that innocence should
manifest
itself by a
stout denial , or guilt by a plain confession .
Thus rating
a man's virtue by the
hardiness of his
constitution
, and
his guilt by the
sensibility
of his
nerves.
But we need
only
state accurately , in order
effectually to expose
this
inhuman
species of mercy , the uncertainty
of which , as a
test and criterion of truth, was long ago pointed
out by
one who lived in a community
where it was usual

The English judgment of penance for standing mute (1)
was as follows : that the prisoner be remanded to the prison
from whence he came
; and put into a low, dark chamber ;
and there be laid on his back , on the bare floor , naked ,
unless where decency forbids : that there be placed upon
his body as great
a weight of iron as he could
bear, and
more
that he have no sustenance , save only , on the first
day , three morsels of the worst bread ; and , on the second
day ,
three draughts
of standing
water , that
should
be
nearest to the prison
door ; and in this
situation
such
should

died , or (as
anciently the judgment
ran ) till he answered (m).

subsisted
at the common law (n), or was introduced
in
consequence
of the statute Westm . 1 , 3 Edw.

to be the better
opinion .
And , at all events , the uncer
tainty of its origin , the doubts that were conceived of its
legality , and the
repugnance of its
theory (for it rarely
was carried into practice ) to the humanity
of the laws of
England, all concurred to require a legislative
abolition of
this cruel process , and a restitution of the ancient common.
law; whereby the standing
mute in felony , as well as in
treason and in trespass, amounted to a confession of the
charge . If, indeed , the corruption of the blood and the con
sequent escheat in felony had been removed , the judgment
of peine forte et dure might perhaps have still innocently
remained ,

a monument
of the

rapacity

THE
TRIAL .
2. Confes-
sion.
escheats
and forfeitures
; since no
one would
ever
have
been tempted to undergo
such
a horrid alternative .
For
the law was, that by standing
mute , and suffering
this
heavy penance, the judgment
, and of course the corruption
of the blood and escheat of the lands , were saved in felony,
though not the forfeiture of the goods : and therefore this
lingering punishment
was probably
introduced , in
order
to extort a plea : without which it was held that no judg-
ment of death could be given , and
so the lord
lost
his
escheat .
But in high treason , as standing mute is equi-
valent
to
a
conviction , the
same judgment
, the
same
corruption
of blood ,
and the
same
forfeitures
always
attended it, as in other
cases of conviction ( p ) .
And , to
the honour
of our laws , it was
enacted
by statute
12
Geo. 3 , c. 20 , that every person who , being
arraigned for
felony
or piracy , shall
stand mute or not
answer directly
to the offence , shall
be
convicted of the same ; and the
same judgment
and execution (with all their consequences
in every respect) shall
be thereupon
awarded , as if the
person had been convicted by verdict
or confession of the
crime ; and now , by the 7 & 8 Geo . 4 , c. 28, s . 2 , when-
ever the prisoner , on his arraignment
for any
treason ,
felony , piracy , or misdemeanor , stands mute of malice , or
will not answer directly to the charge, a plea of not guilty
may be (and always
is) entered for him by order of the
court , and the plea so entered has the same effect as if
the prisoner had actually pleaded it.
And thus much for the demeanor of a prisoner upon his
arraignment .
2. The other incident
to arraignment , exclusive of the
plea, is the prisoner's actual confession of the indictment .
Upon a simple and plain confession , the court has nothing
to do but to award judgment : but it is usually very back-
ward in receiving
and
recording
such
confession , out of
tenderness to the
life of the subject ; and will
generally

of

a
brief reference
to
which may throw
some light upon parts
of
our ancient law
:
it
having
been
introduced
and continued during
the superstitious venera
tion that was paid
to
consecrated ground
in
the times of
popery
.
First then
,
it
is
to
be
observed
,
that
if
a
person
accused
of
any crime
(
except treason
,
wherein the crown
,
and sacrilege
,
wherein the church
,
was too nearly concerned
)
had fled
to
any church
or
churchyard
,
and within forty
days after went
in
sackcloth
and confessed
himself guilty
before the coroner
,
and declared all the particular
circum
stances of the offence
;
and thereupon took the oath
in
that
case
provided
,
viz
.
that he abjured
the realm
,
and would
depart from thence
forthwith
at
the port that should be
assigned him
,
and would
never return without
leave from
the crown
;
he by this means saved his life
,
if
he observed
the conditions
of
the oath
,
by going
,
with
a
cross
in
his
hand and with all convenient
speed
,
to
the port assigned
,
and embarking

in

to

sea

side
,
the
accused
person was
apprehended
and arraigned
in

this felony
,
he might plead the privilege
of
sanctuary
,
and
had
a
right
to
be remanded
,
if

will

But by this abjuration

Formerly
also
the
benefit
of clergy
was
sometimes
pleaded before trial or conviction , and was called a decli
natory plea ; which was the
name also given
to that of
sanctuary (t) .
As
to the benefit of clergy , though
now
abolished , somewhat will be said hereafter .
I proceed , therefore , to some brief consideration of each
of the five heads before mentioned .
1. A plea to the jurisdiction is where an indictment
is
taken
before
a
court , which
has no
cognizance
of the
offence ; as if a man be indicted for a rape at the sheriff's
tourn , or for treason at the quarter
sessions
: in these or
similar
cases , he may except to the jurisdiction of the
court , without answering
to the
crime
alleged (x) .
In
some cases also the defendant may take advantage of the
want ofjurisdiction under the plea of not guilty ; as where
the
objection
proves that no
court in England
can try
the indictment
(y) .
And an objection to the jurisdiction ,
apparent
on the
face of the
proceedings , may
be
taken
advantage of on demurrer (2).
2. A plea in
abatement is now of rare
occurrence in
criminal
procedure .
Formerly such a plea was principally
for a misnomer , a wrong name, or a false addition (a ) to
the
prisoner .
As , if " James "
Allen , " gentleman ,”
were indicted by the name of " John " Allen , " esquire ,"
he might have pleaded that he had the name of James ,
and not of John ; and that he was a gentleman , and not
an esquire.
And , if either
fact were found
by
a jury,
then the indictment
was abated.
But , in the end, there
was little advantage accruing to the prisoner by means of

this dilatory plea ; because , if the exception were allowed ,
a new bill of indictment might have been framed , accord-
ing to what the prisoner in his plea averred to be his true
name and addition .
For it was a rule , upon all pleas in
abatement , that he, who took
advantage of a flaw , must
at the same time show how it might be amended
.
More-
over , the stat . 7 Geo . 4 , c. 64 , s . 19 , enabled the court , if
satisfied by affidavit or otherwise of the truth of a plea of
misnomer
, or want of addition , or wrong addition , forth-
with to amend the indictment
and call upon the party to
plead as if no such dilatory
plea had
been pleaded .
And
now, by 14 & 15 Vict . c. 100 ,
s. 24 , no indictment for any
offence
shall be held
insufficient
" for want of or imper-
fection in the addition " of a defendant , and by s .
1 of
this statute , whenever
on the trial of any indictment
for
felony
or misdemeanor
there
shall
appear to
be
any
variance between the statement in the indictment
and the
evidence
offered
in proof thereof , in
(amongst
other
things ) "the
Christian
name
or
surname ,
or
both
Christian
name and
surname , or other description what-
soever of any
person
or
persons
whomsoever
therein
named
or described ," the court is empowered if it shall
consider such variance not material
to the
merits of the
case , and that the defendant cannot be prejudiced
thereby
in his defence
on such merits , to order the indictment
to
be amended .
Judgment for the crown upon a plea in
abatement if the indictment
be for a misdemeanor is final ,
in treason
or felony it is that
the
defendant
do answer
over (b).

some point

that the fact , as stated , is no felony , treason , or whatever
the crime
is alleged
to be.

such and some other imperfections

For the
defendant judgment upon
demurrer
is given
generally in his favour-for the crown the judgment
upon
a general demurrer to an indictment
for felony is final (e) ,
and judgment upon demurrer
to an indictment
for mis-
demeanor is , unless leave be given by the court to plead
over, likewise final (ƒ) .
Let
us next
consider a more substantial
kind of plea ,
4. Special
Viz .-4 . A special
plea in bar ; which goes to the merits
of the
indictment ,
and gives
a reason why the prisoner
ought
not
to answer it at all , nor put himself upon
his
trial for the crime alleged .
Special
pleas are principally
of three kinds (g) :
( 1. ) A former acquittal
;
(2. ) A former
conviction ; or (3.) A pardon .
(1.) Autre-
fois acquit.
( 1). The
plea of autrefois
acquit (h)
or
a former
ac-
quittal , is grounded on this universal maxim of the com-
mon law of England , that no man is to be brought
into
jeopardy , more than once , for the same
offence ( ) .
And
hence it is allowed
as a consequence
, that when a man is
once fairly found not guilty upon
an indictment , or other
prosecution , before any court having
competent jurisdic-
tion of the offence ( ), he may plead such acquittal in bar
of any subsequent accusation for the same crime , provided
that the previous
indictment
were one upon which

defendant could legally have been convicted ; upon which
his life
or liberty was
not merely in imaginary ,
but in
actual , danger ; and , consequently , in which there was no
material
error () .
The test accordingly
for determining
whether
a
plea
of autrefois
acquit
would
be
proper ,
appears to be this-would
the evidence necessary
to sup
port the second indictment
have been sufficient to procure
a legal conviction upon the first (m) ?

in danger of punishment
for one and the same
crime (o) .
Hereupon it has been held , that a conviction
of manslaughter , on an indictment , is a bar to another
indictment
for
murder ;
for the fact prosecuted is the
same in both , though the offences
differ in colouring
and
in degree . It is to be observed , that the pleas of autrefois
acquit, and
autrefois
convict ,
or
a former
acquittal , and
former
conviction ,
are appropriate
only where there has
been a former judicial decision on the same accusation in
substance ,
and where the

already decided (p) .

remitting
that
punishment
which
the
prosecution
is
calculated to inflict.
There is one advantage that
attends
pleading
a pardon in bar , or in arrest of judgment, before
sentence
is past , which gives it by much the preference to
pleading it after
sentence
or attainder .
This is, that
by
stopping
the judgment it
stops
the attainder , and pre-
vents the corruption of blood ; which , when once corrupted
by attainder , cannot
afterwards
be
restored,
otherwise
than by act of parliament . But as the title of " pardon " is
applicable
to other
stages
of prosecution
;
and it may
have its peculiar force and efficacy , as well
after as before
conviction , outlawry , or attainder ; the more minute
con-
sideration of this will
be reserved till some other
titles
have been gone through (r).
5. It remains that I consider the general issue, or plea
of "not guilty."
In
case of an indictment of felony
or
treason ,
there
can
be
no special justification
put in by
way of plea.
Thus , on an indictment for murder ,
a man
cannot
plead that it was done in his own defence
against
a robber on the highway , or a burglar
; but he must plead
the general issue, not guilty , and give this special matter in
evidence.
And as the facts in treason are laid to be done
proditorie
et contra ligeantiæ suæ debitum , and in felony ,
the killing is laid to be done felonice ; these charges , of a
traitorous
or felonious intent , are the points and very gist
of the indictment , and must be answered directly , by the
general
negative ,
not
guilty ;
and
the jury upon
the
was formerly a good
plea in bar ,
whether it were for the same or any
other
felony
(2 Hawk . P.
C. 375),
because, generally , such proceeding
on a second prosecution
could
not
be to any purpose
for the prisoner
was
dead in law by the first
at-
tainder ,
his
blood
was
corrupted ,
and all that
he had was
forfeited :
so that it was
absurd
and
super-
fluous to endeavour to attaint
him a
second
time.
Now, however , by
the
stat . 7 & 8 Geo . 4, c. 28, s. 4,
a plea
setting
forth
an
attainder
shall not be pleaded in
bar of any
indictment,
unless
the
attainder
be for the
same offence
as that
charged
in the indictment ;
and
hereby the plea
of autrefois
attaint
has been practically
abrogated .

evidence will take notice of any defensive
matter , and
give
their
verdict
accordingly ,
as
effectually
as if it
were , or could be,
specially
pleaded .
So that this is ,
upon all accounts , the most
advantageous
plea for the
prisoner (s).
In the case of an indictment
for a misdemeanor , how
ever, the above rule , as to pleading
the general issue, does
not apply with the same
degree of strictness ; for there are
some cases where a special plea is not only allowable , but
even requisite .
Thus , if the defendant fall within
any
exception or proviso , which
is not contained
in the pur
view of the statute or clause creating the offence , he may ,
by pleading , show that he is entitled to the benefit of that
exception
or
proviso
;
and
there
are
many
pleas
of
this description in the ancient
entries (t).
But the prin
cipal , and indeed almost the only case , in which a special
plea to the merits
may be necessary , is where an indict
ment has been brought for neglecting
to repair a highway
or a bridge (u).
By the plea of " not guilty " a defendant not having
privilege of peerage is now deemed
to have put himself
upon the
country
for trial (x) , and various
formalities ,
which
were formerly
observed
subsequent
to this
plea ,
have fallen into disuse (y) .

(y) The prisoner's
plea
of " not

was
formerly
abbreviated
upon the minutes , thus " non

assize, or clerk of the arraigns , on
behalf of the crown replied , that the
prisoner
was guilty ,
and that
the
crown
was ready to
prove him so.
This was done by two monosyllables ,
"cul. prit .," signifying
first that
the prisoner
was guilty (cul . cul
pable, or culpabilis ), and then
that
the crown
was ready to
prove him
so ; prit, i. e.,

THE
TRIAL .
1. Trial by
ordeal.
numerous than at present , through the superstition
of our
Saxon
ancestors : who , like
other northern
nations , were
extremely
addicted
to divination
; a character which Ta
citus observes of the ancient Germans (~) .
They therefore
invented various methods of purgation
or trial , to preserve
innocence from the danger of false witnesses , and in con
sequence
of a notion
that God would
interpose
miracu
lously to vindicate
the guiltless .
1. A very ancient (a) species of trial was that by ordeal ,
designated judicium Dei ; and sometimes vulgaris purgatio ,
to distinguish it from the canonical
purgation , which was
by the oath of the party . This was of two sorts ( b) , either
fire -ordeal,
or
water -ordeal ; the
former
being
confined
to
persons of higher
rank,
the
latter
to the
common
people (c) .
Both
these
might be performed by deputy
:
but the principal was to answer
for
the
success of the
trial ; the deputy only venturing
some corporal
pain , for
hire , or perhaps for friendship
(d).
Fire -ordeal was per
formed either by taking up in the hand , unhurt , a piece
of red-hot
iron , of one, two , or three pounds weight
or
else by walking , barefoot , and blindfold , over nine red -hot
ploughshares , laid
lengthwise
at unequal
distances : and
if the party escaped
being hurt, he was adjudged
inno
cent ; but if it happened otherwise , as without collusion it
usually did , he was then condemned as guilty .
However ,
by this latter method queen
Emma , the mother of Edward
the Confessor , is mentioned
to have cleared her character ,
when suspected
of familiarity
with Alwyn , bishop of Win
chester (e).
Water-ordeal was performed , either by plunging the

It
bare arm up to the elbow in boiling
water , and escaping
unhurt thereby
or by being
cast into a river or pond of
cold water ; and , if the
suspected person floated therein
without any action of swimming , it was
deemed
an evi
dence of his guilt ; but, if he sunk , he was acquitted .
is easy to trace out the traditional
relics of this
water
ordeal , in the ignorant
barbarity
formerly
practised
to
discover witches by casting them into a pool of water ,
and drowning
them to prove their innocence .
And in the
Eastern
empire the fire -ordeal was used
to the same pur
pose by the Emperor
Theodore Lascaris
; who , attributing
his sickness to magic , caused all those whom he suspected
to handle the hot iron : thus joining
(as has
been well
remarked (ƒ) ) to the most dubious
crime
in the world ,
the most dubious proof of innocence.
This purgation
by ordeal
was known
to the ancient
Greeks
for in the Antigone
of Sophocles (g) , a person ,
suspected by Creon of a misdemeanor ,
declares
himself
ready
to handle
hot
iron , and
to walk over fire ," in
order to manifest his innocence ; which , the scholiast tells
us , was then a very usual
purgation .
And Grotius (h)
gives
us
instances of water -ordeal in Bithynia , Sardinia ,
and other places.
One cannot but be astonished
at the folly and impiety
of pronouncing
a man guilty , unless he was cleared by a
miracle
; and of expecting
that all the powers of nature
should
be
suspended by an immediate
interposition
of
Providence
to
save
the
innocent , whenever it was pre
sumptuously
required .
And yet in England ,
so late
as
king John's time , we find grants to the bishops and clergy
to use the judicium ferri, aquæ
et ignis (i) .
And , both in
England and Sweden , the clergy presided at this trial , and
it was only performed in the
churches or in other conse

THE
TRIAL .
2. Trial by

crated ground
: for which
Stiernhook (k) gives the reason
;
non defuit illis opera
et laboris pretium ; semper
enim ab
ejusmodi judicio aliquid lucri sacerdotibus
obveniebat ."
But ,
to give it its due praise , we find
the canon law very early
declaring against trial by ordeal , or vulgaris purgatio , as
being the fabric of the devil , " cum sit contra preceptum
Domini,
non tentabis Dominum
Deum
tuum (1).”
Upon
this authority , though the
canons themselves were of no
validity in England , it was thought proper to disuse
and
abolish
this
trial entirely in our courts of justice , by an
act of parliament
in 3 Hen. III . according to sir
Edward
Coke (m ), or rather by an order of the king in council (n).
2. Another
species
of purgation ,
somewhat similar to
the
corsned
.
the former
,
but probably
sprung
from
a
presumptuous
abuse
of
revelation
in
the
ages
of
dark superstition
,
was
the
corsned
,
or
morsel
of
execration
:
being
a
piece
of
cheese
or
bread
,
of
about an ounce
in
weight
,
which was
consecrated
with
a
form
of
exorcism
;
desiring
of the
Almighty that
it
might cause
convulsions
and
paleness
,
and find no passage
,
if
the
man was really guilty
;
but
might
turn
to
health
and nourishment
,
if
he was inno-
cent
(o)
;
as
the water
of
jealousy among the Jews
(p
)
was
,
by God's special appointment
,
to
cause the belly
to
swell
,
and the thigh
to
rot
,
if
the woman was guilty
of
adultery
.
This corsned was then given
to
the suspected
person
;
who
at
the same time
also received the holy sacrament
(q)
:
if
indeed the corsned
was not
,
as
some
have suspected
,
the
sacramental
bread itself
;
till the subsequent invention
of
transubstantiation
preserved
it
from profane uses with
a
more
profound
respect
than
formerly

THE
MODE
OF TRIAL .
435
Edward
the Confessor , abjuring
the death of the king's
brother , at last
appealed to his corsned, "per buccellam
deglutiendam
abjuravit " (r) , which stuck in his throat and
killed him .
This
custom has been long
since gradually
abolished , though the remembrance of it still subsists in
certain phrases of abjuration
retained among the common.
people (s).
These two antiquated
methods of trial were
principally
in use among our Saxon ancestors.
The next ,
which remained in force till much more recently , owed its
introduction
among us to the princes of the Norman
line .
And that is,
battle.
3. The trial by battle , duel , or single
combat ; which
3. Trial by
was another
species
of presumptuous
appeal
to Provi-
dence , under an expectation
that
Heaven would
give the
victory to the innocent
or injured party .
The nature of
this trial in cases of civil injury , upon issue joined
in a
writ of right , was discussed in the preceding volume (t) ; to
what was there said I have only
to add , that the trial by
battle might have
been demanded
at the election of the
appellee , in either
an appeal (u) or an
approvement (x) ;
and that it was carried
on with equal solemnity
as on a
writ of right
but with this difference , that there
each
party might
have hired
a champion , but
here
he
was
bound to fight in his proper person (y) .

THE
TRIAL .
were much
the same as upon a writ of right ; only the
oaths
of the
two
combatants
were more striking
and
solemn (a). The appellee , when appealed of felony , pleaded
" not guilty," and, throwing
down his glove , declared
he
would defend the same by his body : the appellant , taking
up the glove , replied that he was ready to make good
the
appeal , body for body.
Thereupon
the appellee , taking
the book in his right hand , and in his left the right hand
of his
antagonist , made
an oath to this
effect : " Hoc
audi , homo , quem per manum teneo ," &c. " Hear this,
O
man ,
whom I
hold
by the
hand ,
who
callest
thyself
John by the name of baptism , that I , who call myself
Thomas
by the
name of baptism ,
did not
feloniously
murder thy father , William
by name, nor am any way
guilty of the
said
felony .
So
help
me
God ,
and the
saints ; and this I will
defend
against
thee by my body ,
as this
court
shall
award ."
To which the appellant re-
plied , holding the Bible and his antagonist's hand in the
same
manner as the other : " Hear
this ,
O man , whom I
hold by the hand , who callest thyself Thomas by the name
of baptism , that thou art perjured ; and therefore perjured ,
because
that
thou
feloniously
didst
murder
my father ,
William by name.
So help me God , and the saints ; and
this I will prove against thee by my body , as this court
shall
award ."
The
battle
was then to be fought with
the same weapons , viz . batons , the same solemnity , and
the
same oath
against
amulets
and sorcery, that
were
used in the
civil combat ; and if the appellee were so far
vanquished ,
that
he could
not
or would
not fight any
longer , he was adjudged to be hanged immediately
;
and
then , as well as if he were killed
in battle , Providence
was
deemed
to have determined in favour of the truth, and his
blood was attainted . But if he killed the appellant , or could
maintain
the fight from sunrising
till the stars appeared
in the evening , he was acquitted .
So also if the appel-

word
craven ,” he was adjudged
to lose his liberam legem , and
became infamous ; and the
appellee

mages , and so was for
ever

but of all indictments

that by the peers

,
in
the court
of

in

Of this enough was said
in

to
which
I
may add
,
that
,
in
its
pro

,
this solemn mode
of

little from the

by jury

except that
no

the

The fifth

The
antiquity
and
excellence
of
this trial
,
for the
settling
of
civil property
,
has before been explained
(ƒ

And what was then said
applies
yet
more
strongly
in
criminal
cases
;
since
,
in
times
of
difficulty
and danger
,
greater evil
is
to
be appre

the
violence
and partiality
of
judges ap

,
in
suits between the sovereign and
the subject
,
than
in
disputes between one individual
and
another

therefore
,

THE

process.
the crown .
It was
necessary, for preserving
the admir-
able
balance
of
our constitution , to vest the
executive
power of the laws in the sovereign : and yet
this power
might be dangerous and destructive to that very constitu-
tion , if exerted without
check or control , by justices
of
oyer and terminer occasionally named by the crown : who
might then
imprison , dispatch ,
or exile
any
man
ob-
noxious
to the government , by an instant
declaration ,
that such is their will and pleasure .
But the founders of
the English law have with excellent
forecast contrived ,
that no man
should
be
called on to answer to the crown
for any crime , unless upon the preparatory
accusation of
twelve or more of his fellow subjects , the grand jury : and
that the truth of every accusation , whether
preferred
in
the shape of indictment
or information , should afterwards
be confirmed by the unanimous
suffrage of twelve of his
equals and neighbours , indifferently
chosen and superior
to all suspicion .
So that the liberties of England cannot
but subsist
so long as this palladium
remains sacred
and
inviolate , not only from open attacks on it (which none ,
perhaps , would
be so hardy
as to make ) , but
also from
secret machinations , which might sap and undermine it.
V.
Before commissioners of oyer and terminer and gaol
delivery , the sheriff , by virtue of a general precept directed
to him beforehand , returns to the court a panel of at least
forty -eight jurors , for the
determination
of criminal
as
well as civil issues at that
session
; and accordingly it is
there usual
to try all felons
immediately , or
soon , after
their arraignment .
But it was formerly
not customary ,
nor agreeable to the general course of proceedings , (unless
by consent of parties , or where the defendant was actually
in custody , ) to try persons indicted
for misdemeanor
at
the same court at which
they had pleaded not guilty , or
traversed the indictment .
But they usually gave security
to the court , to appear at the next assizes or session
, and
then and there to try the traverse , giving notice to the pro-

secutor of the same .
Now, however , the statute
14 & 15
Vict. c. 100 , by its 27th section enacts, that " no person
prosecuted shall
be entitled
to traverse or postpone the
trial of any indictment
found
against
him at any session
of the peace , session of oyer and terminer , or session
of
gaol
delivery : provided
always ,
that if the
court , upon
the application
of the
person so indicted
or
otherwise ,
shall be of opinion that he ought to be allowed
a further
time , either to prepare for his defence
or otherwise , such
court
may adjourn
the trial of such person to the next
subsequent session, upon
such terms
as to bail or other
wise
as to such
court shall
seem meet, and may respite
the recognizances of the prosecutor and witnesses accord
ingly , in which
case the prosecutor and witnesses shall be
bound to attend
to prosecute and give
evidence at such
subsequent session without
entering
into any fresh recog
nizance
for that
purpose ."
In
felonies
as well as mis
demeanors the court has indeed , independently of statute ,
authority
to postpone the trial to a subsequent
assizes or
sessions, for
sufficient
cause , as the unavoidable
absence
of a material
witness , or the existence of a prejudice
in
the jury , shown
upon
affidavit , at the instance either of
the prosecutor
or the defendant .
Where the application
is made by the defendant , in a case of felony , the court
will remand him, and detain him in custody till the next
assizes or sessions ; where by the prosecutor , it is in
the
discretion of the court to detain the defendant in custody ,
or admit him to bail , or discharge him on his own recog
nizance ; but after a bill has been found , in any case of a
serious nature , bail will not be taken .
What
was
said
of juries in
general ,
and
the
trial
thereby , in civil cases , will greatly
shorten
our present
remarks , with regard
to the trial of criminal
suits : a
reference indeed to the preceding volume will show that
the qualifications
of petty jurors
on criminal
are the same
as
on civil trials (g) , that
the grounds of disqualification

THE TRIAL .
and exemption
from
serving
as
such
are likewise
the
same, and what was there
said respecting
the
mode of
preparing
the jury lists , returning
the names of persons
qualified
as jurors, making
up the jury book , and
sum-
moning the jurors , will now generally apply (h).
On
a trial
in the court of queen's bench for misde-
meanor-though not for treason
or felony-a special jury
may be obtained on the application of either the prosecutor
or the defendant (i) , and the precept issued by the judges
of assize for the sheriff to summon jurors for the assizes ,
directs him to summon
a sufficient
number
of
special
jurymen not exceeding forty -eight in all to try the special
jury causes , and from these a special jury will be struck (k) ;
the proper
number of jurors , if not in attendance , being
made up by a tales .
Where
an alien ( ) is indicted , the
jury should
be de medietate
linguæ , or half foreigners , if
so many
are found in the place (m) ; but this
does
not
hold
in treason , aliens
being
very improper
judges
of
the
breach of allegiance (n).
And
the
stat .
6
Geo . 4,
c. 50 , s . 47, expressly provides , that
nothing in that
act
reversed by reason
that the jury
process has been awarded to a wrong
officer upon
an insufficient
sugges
tion, nor for any misnomer
or mis-
description
of the officer
returning
such
process,
or
of
any
of the
jurors, nor
because any person has
served upon the jury who
has not
been
returned
as
a juror by the
sheriff
or other officer .

442
THE
TRIAL .
the prisoner
an arbitrary
and capricious
species
of chal
lenge to a certain number of jurors , without showing
any
cause at all ; which
is called a peremptory challenge : a
provision
full of tenderness
and humanity
to prisoners .
This is grounded on two reasons .
1. As every one must
be sensible , what
sudden impressions
and unaccountable
prejudices we are apt to conceive
upon the bare looks and
gestures of another ; and how necessary
it is, that a pri
soner (when put to defend himself) should have a good
opinion of his jury , the want of which
might
totally dis
concert him ; the law wills not that he should
be tried by
any one man against whom he has conceived
a prejudice ,
even without
being
able to assign
a reason for such his
dislike .
2. Because, upon challenges for cause
shown , if
the reason assigned prove insufficient
to
set aside
the
juror , perhaps the bare questioning
his
indifference
may
sometimes provoke a resentment ; to prevent all
ill
con
sequences
from which
,
the prisoner
is
still
at
liberty
,
if
he
pleases
,
peremptorily
to
set him aside
.
This privilege
,
of
peremptory challenge
,
though granted
to
the prisoner
,
is
denied
to
the crown by the statute
6
Geo
.
4,
c.
50
,
s.
29
(q),
which provides
,
that the crown
shall
challenge
no jurors without
assigning
a
cause cer
tain
,
to
be tried and approved by the court
.
However
,
it
is
held
,
that
the
crown
need
not assign
a
cause
of
chal
lenge
,
till all the panel
is
gone through and exhausted
(r),
and unless there cannot
be
a
full jury without
the person
so
challenged
.
And then
,
and
not
sooner
,
counsel for
the
crown
must
show the
cause
:
otherwise
the juror
objected
to
shall
be
sworn
(s).
And
the
practice
is
the
same in trials for misdemeanors as in those for treason or
felony

RIGHT
OF CHALLENGE
.
443
Where there is a challenge for cause, two persons in
court , not of the jury , are sworn to try whether
the jury
man challenged is indifferent .
Evidence is then produced
to support
the
challenge ; and according
to the verdict
of the two
tryers , the juryman
is
admitted
or re
jected (u).
The peremptory challenges of the prisoner
must
how
ever have some reasonable boundary
; otherwise he might
never be tried .
This reasonable boundary is in high treason
(save as presently mentioned ) settled to be the number of
thirty-five : that
is , one under the number of three full
juries.
For the law judges
that five-and-thirty are fully
sufficient to allow the most timorous
man to challenge
through
mere
caprice ; and
that
he
who
peremptorily
challenges a greater number , or three full juries, has
not
intention
to be tried at all
.
And
therefore
the
common
law dealt with
one
who peremptorily
challenged
above
thirty
-
five
,
and would
not retract
his
challenge
,
as
with
one who stood mute
or
refused
to
take his trial
;
by sen
tencing him
to
the peine forte
et
dure
in
felony
,
and by
attainting him
in
treason
(x).
Where the treason charged
is
the compassing the queen's death
,
and an overt act alleged
in the indictment
is
the assassination
of
the queen
,
or
any
direct
attempt
against
her life
,
or
against
her
person
,
whereby her life may be endangered
,
or
her person may
suffer bodily harm
(y
):
as
also
in
murder and other felo
nies
(
):
no person arraigned
can
be
admitted
to
make
more than
twenty
peremptory
challenges
.
Where
the
indictment
charges
misprision
of
treason
,
the
number
of
such challenges
to
be allowed
is
doubtful

THE TRIAL .

evidence.
cases
of misdemeanor
no right of peremptory
challenge
exists at all (b).
By statute 7 & 8 Geo . 4 , c. 28, s. 3, if any person in-
dicted for treason , felony , or piracy , challenge
peremp-
torily
a greater
number
of jurors than
such
person
is
entitled by law to challenge , every peremptory
challenge
beyond the number
so allowed shall be void , and the trial
shall proceed as if no such challenge had been made.
If,
again , by reason of challenges
or the default of jurors , a
sufficient number
cannot be had of the
original
panel , a
fresh panel will
be returned (c) till the number of twelve
has at
length
been made up and
sworn or affirmed (d)
well and truly to try, and true deliverance make , between
our sovereign lady the queen , and the prisoner whom they
have in charge ; and a true verdict
to give , according
to
the evidence.
VII. When the jury is sworn , the indictment
is usually
opened , and the evidence marshalled , examined , and en-
forced by the counsel for the crown , or prosecution , whose
duty in conducting
the case differs
in some respects from
that of counsel for the plaintiff at
a civil trial.
In the
former
situation
counsel
are
to
regard
themselves
as
assisting
in the
administration
of justice
not as advo-
cating
a particular interest , nor
as pledged to support
a
particular
view .
Before
a criminal
tribunal counsel for
the crown must satisfy the jury that the
offence
charged
in the indictment
has been committed by the prisoner , or
if the entire charge be
divisible
that
so much of it is
true as will warrant a verdict of guilty in respect to that
portion of it.
Where the offence
charged is such at com-
mon law, the substance of and
ingredients in it must be
established .
Where
an
offence
is
such by statute , the
statutory ingredients
in it must be made out.

THE MODE
OF
PROOF .
445
gredients respectively
may for the most part be collected
from the preceding
pages .
As to the mode of proving
them a few suggestions may here be proper .
Evidence may be either direct and positive or presump
tive and circumstantial
.
A presumption
of any fact is an
inferring of that fact from other facts that are known ; it
is an act of reasoning .
A fact , however ,
must
not be
inferred without
premises that will warrant the inference ,
for the law holds that it is better that ten guilty persons
escape , than that one innocent person suffer . If, however ,
no fact could thus be ascertained by inference , in a court
of law, very few offenders would
be brought
to punish
ment .
In drawing
an inference or conclusion
from
facts
proved, regard
must
always be had to the nature of the
particular
case , and the facility that appears to be afforded
either of explanation
or contradiction .
No person is to be
required
to explain
or
contradict
until enough has
been
proved to warrant
a reasonable and just conclusion against
him in the absence
of explanation
or contradiction
; but
when
such proof
has been
given , and the nature of the
case is such as to admit of explanation
or
contradiction ,
and the
accused
offers
none,
human
reason
cannot
do
otherwise than
adopt the conclusion to which
the proof
tends (e).
Such
is in brief the
nature of presumptive
evidence and the
reason for admitting
it .
And there is
scarcely
a criminal case , from the highest
down to the
lowest , in which courts
of justice
do
not
act upon the
principle
of giving
weight
to
presumptions
; for
as it
seldom happens that absolute certainty can be obtained in
human affairs , therefore reason and public utility require
that judges
and all mankind
in forming
their opinions of
the truth of facts should be regulated by a preponderance
ofprobabilities
.
Accordingly
, in the highest crime known
to the law, viz . treason , our courts act upon presumption .

THE
TRIAL .
they presume
an intent to kill the sovereign .
In homi
cide, upon proof of the fact of killing , they presume
the
malice necessary to constitute
murder , and put it on the
prisoner
by extracting
facts in
cross -examination
or by
direct
testimony to lower his offence
to manslaughter
or
justifiable homicide .
In burglary, highway
robbery , or
simple
larceny , if a person is found
in possession of the
goods recently
after the
crime has been committed , our
law presumes the possessor guilty , unless he can account
for the possession . In the case of a libel which is charged
to be written with a particular
intent , if the libel is calcu
lated to produce the effect charged to be intended ,
the
intent will be presumed .
We must , as reasonable beings ,
act on presumptive
proof, or leave the worst
crimes un
punished ; though where presumption
is attempted
to be
raised
as to the
corpus
delicti-the commission
of the
substantive
act charged-such presumption
ought to be
strong and cogent (f).
The doctrine of evidence as regards pleas of the crown
is, in most respects , the same as that recognised in civil
actions (g).
The case for the prosecution must
be estab
lished ,
1 , by admissible
evidence, and, 2 , by competent
witnesses.
1. No proof is admissible which in its very nature indi
cates the
existence of some better
proof ;
thus
hearsay
evidence is not admissible .
This is the objection perhaps
most commonly taken to the reception
of evidence
at a
trial for any ordinary
offence
; statements of third persons

Some few exceptions only to this rule

cludes hearsay evidence

( 1. ) The

so
ill

,
that such deposition was taken

wise be read (¿).
(2. ) Upon a trial for felonious homicide the declarations
of the
deceased
made when
he believed
himself to be
in a dying state and past hope of recovery are admissible ,
the death of the deceased
being the subject of the charge,
and the
circumstances of the death being the subject of
the dying declaration (k) .
(3.) An admission
or confession made by the accused
is likewise admissible in evidence
against him if freely and
voluntarily made-neither induced by a threat of evil , nor
by the holding
out of any benefit to him (7) , and ,-

affection
is unable
to comprehend
the nature and obli-

oath-or who

No person charged with

THE
MODE
OF
PROOF .

proofs must be elicited
by questions properly worded and
directed .
1. An irrelevant
question ought
not to be put .
And
this rule of rejecting
all manner of evidence in criminal
prosecutions that is foreign to the point in issue is founded
on sound
sense and common justice.
For " no man ," it
has been said (q) , " is bound at the peril of life or liberty ,
fortune or reputation , to answer at once
and unprepared
for every action of his life .
Few even
of the best men
would
choose to be put to it."
The rule , moreover, which
requires certainty in the indictment (r) , would be nugatory
if evidence irrelevant
to the issue raised upon it were ad
mitted .
And further , the time of the court
must
not be
uselessly occupied ; nor should the attention of the jury
be invited
to inquiries
immaterial -or frivolous-and fo
reign to the real points for their decision .
2. An artifice of this sort is not permitted- to get from
a witness by means of a " leading question " the narrative
desired, to suggest the answer which would
be acceptable
by the very wording
and framing of the question .
The
putting of leading questions , except where allowed with a
view to saving of time ,
and in respect of matters
the
eliciting of which
cannot
prejudice
the prisoner ,
or by
permission of the court where a witness is manifestly
hos
tile-is much to be deprecated (s) .
As regards respectively
the examination
of witnesses
and the proof of instruments
and handwriting
, the fol
lowing statutory regulations
have been promulgated :
1.
The party
producing
a witness will not
be allowed
to impeach his credit
by general
evidence of bad cha
racter , but he may, in case the witness , in the opinion of
the judge, prove
adverse ,
contradict
him by other evi
dence, or, by leave of the judge , prove that he has made

THE TRIAL .
at other times a statement inconsistent
with his present
testimony ; but before such last -mentioned proof can
be
given
the
circumstances
of the
supposed
statement ,
sufficient
to designate
the particular
occasion , must
be
mentioned to the witness , and he must be asked whether
or not he has made such statement (t).
2. It is not necessary to prove by the attesting witness
an instrument
to the validity of which attestation
is not
requisite , and such instrument
may be proved as if there
had been no attesting witness thereto (u).
3. Comparison
of a disputed writing with any writing
proved to the satisfaction of the judge
to be genuine may
be made by witnesses ; and such writings , and the evi-
dence of witnesses respecting the same , may be submitted
to the court
and jury
as evidence of the genuineness or
otherwise of the writing in dispute (x) .
As regards the number of witnesses
needed
to support
a conviction in certain
cases , the following
peculiarities
are noticeable .
In a case of high treason or misprision
of treason , by
statutes
1 Edw .
6,
c.
12 , and 5 & 6 Edw . 6, c.
11 , two
lawful witnesses are required to convict a prisoner
; unless
he shall willingly and without violence confess
the
same .
By statute
7 Will . 3 ,
c .
3 , in a prosecution for
treason ,
the same rule of requiring two witnesses is again enforced
;
with this addition , that the
confession of the
prisoner ,
which shall countervail
the necessity of such proof, must
be in open court .
In the construction of which act it has
been held (y) , that a confession of the prisoner , taken out
of court, before a magistrate or person having
competent
authority to take it, and proved by two witnesses , is suffi-
cient to convict him of treason .
But hasty unguarded
confessions , made to persons having
no such authority ,
(t) 28 Vict . c. 18, s. 3.
(u) Id. s. 7.
By the 17 & 18 Vict . c. 83, s. 27,
every instrument liable
to
stamp
duty is
admissible
in
evidence in
any criminal
proceeding
although
not stamped as required by law .

THE MODE
OF
PROOF .

ought not to be admitted
as evidence under this statute.
And indeed , even in cases of felony at the common law,
they are the weakest and most suspicious of all testimony ;
ever liable to be obtained by artifice , false hopes , promises
of favour , or menaces ; seldom remembered accurately , or
reported with due precision ; and incapable in their nature
of being
disproved
by
other
negative
evidence.
By
the
same
statute
of 7 Will .
3 it is declared , that
both
witnesses must be to the same overt act of treason , or one
to one overt act, and the other to another overt act , of the
same
species
of treason (2), and not of distinct
heads or
kinds
and
no evidence shall
be admitted
to prove any
overt
act
not
expressly
laid in
the
indictment .
And
therefore in sir John Fenwick's case , in king William's
time , where
there was but one witness , an act of parlia-
ment (a) was made on purpose to attaint him of treason
,
and he was executed
(b).
In high
treason where
the
overt
act
alleged
is the
killing of the
queen , or any direct
attempt
against
her
life or person , and in misprision
of such treason , one wit-
ness
is
sufficient (c).
And
in
support
of almost every
other accusation one positive witness will suffice .
Mon-
tesquieu, indeed , lays it down for a rule (d), that those
laws which condemn
a man to death in any case , on the
deposition of a single witness , are fatal to liberty
: and he
adds
this reason, that the witness
who affirms , and the
accused who denies , make
an equal balance (e) ; there is
a necessity therefore to call in a third man to incline the
scale .
But this seems to be carrying matters too far : for
there
are some crimes , in which the very privacy of their
nature
excludes
the
possibility
of having
more
than
one
witness ; must
these therefore
escape
unpunished ?
Neither indeed is the bare denial
of the person accused

THE
TRIAL .
equivalent to the positive
oath of a disinterested
witness .
In cases of indictments
for perjury , this doctrine
is better
founded ; and there our law adopts it : for one witness is
not allowed to convict a man indicted for perjury ; because
then
there
is
only
one oath
against
another (ƒ) .
In
a case of treason also there is the accused's oath of alle
giance , to counterpoise the
information
of a single wit
ness ; and that
may
perhaps
be one reason why the law
requires
a double testimony to convict him : though the
principal
reason , undoubtedly , is to secure the subject from
being sacrificed to fictitious
conspiracies , which have been
the engines of profligate and crafty politicians
in all ages.
At the close of the
case for the prosecution , the pre
siding judge will, if the accused be defended by counsel ,
ask
whether it is intended
to adduce evidence for the
defence , and if none is to be offered (g) , the counsel for
the prosecution
will be allowed
to address
the jury
a
second time , for the purpose of summing
up the evidence
for the crown (h).
It was formerly
a settled
rule
at common law, that no
counsel
should
be allowed
a prisoner
upon his trial for
felony , unless
some point of law arose
proper
to be de
bated (i) ; but the hardship of this rule was so apparent
(f) In Reg. v.
Shaw , L.
&
C.
579, 590, Erle, C. J. , observes , " It
is well-ascertained law that upon an
indictment
for perjury it is
neces
sary to have more than the evidence
of one witness alone ; for that isbut
the oath of one against
one, which
leaves
the
matter
even,
and
en
titles the prisoner
to
an
acquittal .
The prosecution
must do more than
that .
They must turn the scale by
corroborating
their witness .
The
degree
of corroboration ,
however ,
which is necessary , is not
definable ,
and
any attempt
to
define it will
prove illusory.'
(g) Where
presumptive
and cir
39
cumstantial
evidence is mainly or
wholly relied upon for
the prosecu
tion, witnesses will not probably be
called
for the
prisoner ,
unless
to
speak to
character ,
or
where
an
alibi is meant
to
be established
;
the defence will rather rest upon a
chain of reasoning
so put together
as to show that the
deductions
and
inferences
relied
on for the crown
are not fair, natural , and reasonable
deductions
and
inferences , or
such
as ought alone to satisfy the consci
entious
scruples of ajury.

that the judges
never scrupled to allow a prisoner
counsel
to instruct
him what questions to ask ,
or even to ask
questions for him, with respect to matters of fact : for as to
matters of law arising on the trial , he was entitled
to the
assistance
of counsel.
Lest,
however , this
indulgence
should be intercepted by superior influence , in the case of
state -criminals , the legislature
directed by statute
7 Will.
3,
c. 3, that
persons indicted
for high treason , or mis-
prision thereof, may make their full
defence
by counsel ,
not exceeding
two ,
to be
named
by the
prisoner
and
assigned by the court or judge : and the same indulgence ,
by statute
20
Geo.
2 ,
c.
30,
was
extended
to parlia-
mentary impeachments
for high treason, which
were ex-
cepted in the former act. In misdemeanors , the defendant
was always allowed counsel as in civil actions .
And now ,
by the
6 & 7 Will . 4 , c. 114 ,
s .
1 , all
persons
tried
for
felony are admitted , after the close of the
case
for the
prosecution , to make full answer and defence
thereto by
counsel , or by attorney in courts where
attornies
practise
as counsel .
Also by the 28 & 29 Vict . c. 18 , s. 2 , " upon
every trial for felony
or misdemeanor , whether
the pri-
soners
or defendants , or any of them , shall be defended
by counsel or not ,
each
and every such prisoner
or de-
fendant ,
or
his
or their
counsel
respectively ,
shall
be
allowed , if he or they shall think
fit
,
to
open his
or
their

respectively
:
and
after

of

if

According
to

and commonly

derived
from the civil law

nesses .
And therefore it deserves
to be remembered
to
the honour of queen Mary, that when she appointed
sir
Richard
Morgan
chief justice of the common
pleas ,
she
enjoined him , " that notwithstanding
the old error , which
did not admit
any witness
to speak, or any other matter
to be heard , in favour of the adversary , her majesty being
party ; her highness's pleasure was , that whatsoever could
be brought in favour of the
subject should be admitted
to
be heard
and , moreover , that the justices should not per
suade themselves
to sit
in judgment
otherwise
for her
highness than for her subject " (1).
Afterwards , in
one
particular
instance (when embezzling
the queen's
military
stores
was made felony by statute
31 Eliz . c. 4 ) , it was
provided ,
that
any
person
impeached
for
such
felony ,
" should be received and admitted
to make
any lawful
proof that he could , by lawful witness or otherwise , for his
discharge and defence
:" and the courts grew so heartily
ashamed of a doctrine
thus unreasonable
and oppressive ,
that
a practice
was gradually
introduced
of examining
witnesses for the prisoner , but
not upon
oath (m) :
the
consequence
of which
still
was , that
the jury gave less
credit
to the prisoner's
evidence, than to that produced
by the
crown (n).
At
length ,
however , by the statute
7 Will .
3 ,
c.
3 , the
same measure of justice was esta
blished
throughout
all the realm , in
cases
of
treason
within the act
and it was afterwards
declared by statute
1 Ann . st. 2 , c . 9 , that in all cases of treason and felony ,
witnesses for the prisoner should be examined upon oath ,
in like manner as the witnesses against him .
:
In cases of high treason, or misprision
of such treason ,
it is enacted by statute 7 Will . 3 , c. 3 , that the prisoner
shall have a copy of the indictment , but not the names of
the witnesses , five days at least before the trial ; that is ,
upon the true construction
of the act, before his arraign

examinations
of witnesses against
a person charged with
an indictable
offence
have been completed , and before the
first day of the assizes
or sessions, or first sitting of the
court
at which
such person
is to be tried , he
shall
be
entitled
to have copies of the depositions on which he was
committed
or held to bail, on payment
of a reasonable
sum for the same.
The accused
is also entitled to copies
of the depositions of the witnesses examined on his behalf
before the committing
magistrate , under the 3rd section
of the 30 & 31 Vict . c. 35 (y) .
The object of the prisoner's
counsel at a criminal
trial
may be twofold- 1. to exculpate his client by independent
proofs ; 2. to discredit the witnesses for the crown .
And
evidence to impeach
the credibility of a witness will be
obtained ( 1 ) , should he on
cross -examination
be made to
contradict himself, or be involved in inconsistencies .
Such
evidence may tend to show (2) that he
was a spy and
informer , or (3) that he was an accomplice , or (4) that he
has been convicted of some crime , or (5) that he is not to
be believed upon his
oath .
As to each of these grounds
for attempting
to discredit
a witness at a criminal
trial ,
some brief remarks will be offered.
(1). A witness may be not altogether untrustworthy
who
on a skilful cross -examination
becomes
involved in contra
dictions ,
for this
may be through
the
weakness of his
memory , or possibly through the nervousness
and confusion
in which he finds himself when subjected to so severe and
unaccustomed
an ordeal .
It will be for the jury
to ob
serve the demeanor , and compare the answers of a witness
thus
contradicting
himself,
and
to form
their
opinion
accordingly .
In connection
with this head of our subject we may
add, that if a witness , upon
cross -examination
as to a
former
statement
made by
him
inconsistent
with his
present testimony , does not distinctly
admit that he has
made such statement , proof may be given that he did in

THE TRIAL .
fact
make it ; but
before
such proof
can be
given
the
circumstances
of the
supposed
statement ,
sufficient
to
designate the
particular
occasion
, must be mentioned to
the witness , and he must be asked whether or not he did
make
such
statement (~).
Further,
a witness
may be
cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in
writing or
reduced into writing
relative
to the
subject
matter
of the
indictment ,
without
such
writing
being
shown to him ; though if it is intended to contradict
such
witness by the writing , his
attention
must , before
such
contradictory proof can be given , be called to those parts
of the writing which
are to
be
used for
the
purpose
of
so contradicting
him ;
but
the judge ,
at
any
time
during
the
trial ,
may
require
the
production
of
the
writing
for
his
inspection ,
and
may
thereupon
make
such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he may think
fit (a).
(2) .
To persons
who
enter into communication
with
conspirators
in pursuance of an original purpose of dis-
closing their designs
and machinations
for the benefit of
the public , much
disfavour
naturally
attaches .
The tes-
timony of an informer
is , however , legally admissible ( b) ,
and the
existence of the original purpose on his part is
best
evinced by
a conduct which
precludes
him
from
ever wavering
in
or swerving
from
the
discharge of his
duty , if he might otherwise be disposed to do so (c).
(3). Evidence to impeach the character and credibility of
a witness may tend to show that he was an accomplice-
that he was criminally engaged and
mixed
up
in
the
transactions to which he afterwards deposes .
An accom-
plice is clearly admissible
as a witness (d) .
His testimony
is however to be received and acted upon with
a scru-
pulous
consideration
of its merit and value .

sullied with some degree of contamination
by having par-
ticipated in the very crime which
he imputes
to others .
The witness
who
comes
thus primâ facie contaminated
may nevertheless
be
so confirmed by the
clearness
and
consistency of his own
narrative ,
and still
more by its
conformity
to and
coincidence with the substance of the
testimony of others not likely to have conspired with him
in the crime itself, or to have had the means of concerting
and colluding with him as to the matter of his testimony.
-that the witness may thus become
entitled to the fullest
credence (e).
And still more so if he is found to be con-
firmed by a variety of collateral and independent facts and
circumstances , and to be uncontradicted
in any essential
particular (ƒ).
(4).
Should the fact that the witness has been convicted
of some
offence
be elicited from him-that may
weigh
according
to circumstances with the jury ; but a witness
cannot
be compelled to answer-though it seems he may
be asked
a question , the reply to which might criminate
or tend
to
criminate
him ; and the 3rd sect . of the 14 &
15 Vict. c. 99 , expressly provides that nothing in that act
contained shall render a person compellable to answer any
question
so tending .
A witness
may however be ques-
tioned
as to whether he has been convicted of any felony
or
misdemeanor , and

being
so questioned , if he

answer , the
cross -examining
party may prove such
con-
viction (g).
And a conviction for crime will not affect the
competency of a witness (h).
(5) . Lastly , in
cross -examination , the
practice
which
has long obtained is proper of allowing
the accused
to call
witnesses for the purpose of discrediting
the testimony of
those who
have given
evidence
for the crown-the
ques-
tion to be asked any such witness
being of this kind-
would you , from your knowledge of the general reputation
of A. , believe his statements upon oath ?
An answer to
this question in the negative will be admissible (¿) .
The right to reply where evidence
is given for the pri-
soner or defendant is vested in the counsel for the crown (k)
-though not usually exercised where witnesses are called
to speak merely to the character of the
accused
(l) ; and
if upon the trial of a person for any subsequent felony,
not capital , evidence of good character be given , the pro-
secutor may , in answer thereto , give evidence
of the con-
viction of such person for a previous felony , and the jury
will have to inquire
concerning
such previous
conviction
at the same time
that
they inquire
concerning
the
sub-
sequent felony (m).
When the evidence
and
speeches
of counsel on both
sides
are closed, it is for the court to instruct
the jury as
to matters of law, to read and comment upon the evidence ,
to clear away difficulties
and remove obstacles— in their
way towards a satisfactory
conclusion .
It has been said
that the judge
at a criminal trial is
counsel for the
prisoner-but this can only hold at all specifically

the accused
is undefended (n) .
In a general and scarcely
accurate
sense
however the court
may be spoken of as
counsel for the prisoner , inasmuch
as upon them devolves
the duty of determining
as to the competency of witnesses
and the admissibility
and relevancy of proofs , of deter
mining, moreover, whether
any
case
such as
should
be
submitted
to the jury has been made out on the part of
the prosecution . It

which
a
conviction
might safely rest ,
has
been
adduced

there be such, he will rehearse it from his

appropriate .
And
for the jury will it be (taking the law from the
court ) to
determine as to facts (p) .

THE TRIAL .
while
the jury
are withdrawn
to
confer,
and
return to
receive the verdict in open court .
And
such
public
or
open verdict
may be either general , guilty, or not guilty ;
or special , setting forth all the circumstances of the case,
and
praying
the judgment of the
court ,
whether , for
instance , on the facts stated, it be murder , manslaughter ,
or no crime at all .
This is where they doubt
the matter
of the law, and therefore choose
to leave it to the deter-
mination
of the court ; though
they have an unquestion-
able right of determining
upon all the circumstances , and
finding
a general verdict , if they think proper so to hazard
a breach of their oaths .
But the practice , heretofore
in
use , of fining , imprisoning
, or otherwise punishing
jurors ,
merely
at the
discretion
of the court , for finding their
verdict contrary to the
direction
of the judge , was arbi- *
trary , unconstitutional
, and illegal (t) ; and is treated
as
such by Sir Thomas Smith , two hundred
years ago ; who
accounted " such
doings to be very violent , tyrannical ,
and contrary to the liberty and
custom of the realm of
England (u)." For , as Sir Matthew Hale well observes (x) ,
it would
be a most
unhappy
case for the judge
himself,
if the
prisoner's
fate depended
upon his directions :-
unhappy
also
for
the
prisoner
:
for , if the
judge's
opinion
must rule the verdict , the trial by jury would
be
useless.
If the jury find
the prisoner
not guilty, he is then for
ever quit and discharged of the accusation .
And upon
such his acquittal , or discharge for want of prosecution ,
he shall
be immediately
set at large without
payment of
any fee to the gaoler (y).
But if the jury find him.
guilty, he is then
said
to
be
convicted of the
crime
whereof he stands indicted .
Which conviction may accrue

ing guilty ; or by his being found so by the verdict of his
country .
A verdict of " guilty " must rest upon and be supported
by the indictment ; it must
rest either
upon
the whole
indictment
or upon some portion of it material in itself and
separable from the
other
portions ,
or it must
be sup
portable
in virtue
of some power given to the jury by
express
enactment (≈) .
An
intermediate
state between
that of entire innocence and guilt , is sometimes also thus
evidenced.
It may appear conclusively
that the accused ,
though he has failed
to commit the crime set forth in the
indictment ,
has
nevertheless
attempted
to
commit it.
And our law-though
declining
to concern itself with
a
bare intention - takes cognisance under
divers
and dis
similar circumstances of an
attempt (a) .
Whenever
the
attempt
merely is thus
indictable
the
ends
of justice
require that a jury should
be empowered upon an indict
ment either for felony or for misdemeanor , to convict of the
attempt to commit it , and this power was conferred
upon
them by the 9th sect. of the
14 & 15 Vict .
c . 100 (b) ,
which
leaves
untouched the mode of procedure by indict
ment for an attempt where it seems that an attempt

clergy.
Benefit of " benefit of
clergy ," had
its origin (e) from the pious
regard paid by
Christian
princes
to the
church
in
its
infant state
;
and the
ill
use which the popish ecclesiastics
soon made
of
that pious regard
.
The exemptions
granted
to
the church were principally
of
two kinds
:
1.
Exemp-
tion
of
places
,
consecrated
to
religious duties
,
from criminal
arrests
,
which
was the
foundation
of
sanctuaries
(ƒ
).
2.
Exemption
of
the persons
of
clergymen from criminal
process
before
the
secular
judge
in
a
few
particular
cases
,
whence the origin and meaning
of
the privilegium
clericale
.
But
the
clergy
,
increasing
in
wealth
,
power
,
honour
,
number
,
and interest
,
began soon
to
set up for themselves
:
and that which they had obtained by the favour of the civil
government
,
they now claimed
as
their inherent right
;
and
as
a
right
of
the highest
nature
,
indefeasible
,
and
jure divino
.
By their
canons therefore and constitutions
they
endeavoured
at
,
and
where
they
met
with
easy
princes obtained
,
a
vast extension
of
these exemptions
:
as
well
in
regard
to
the crimes themselves
,
of
which the list
became
quite
universal
:
as
in
regard
to
the
persons
exempted
,
among
whom
were
at
length comprehended
not
only every little
subordinate
officer
belonging
to
the church
or
clergy
,
but even
many
who
were totally
laymen
.
In
England
however
,
although
the usurpations
of
the
pope were very many
and
grievous
,
till Henry VIII
.
exterminated
his supremacy
,
yet
a
total exemption
of
the
clergy
from
secular
jurisdiction
could
never be tho-
roughly
effected
:
and
therefore
,
though
the ancient
privilegium
clericale was
in
some capital
cases
,
yet
it
was
soon after
,
asked by the court
,
if
he
has any thing
to
offer why judgment
should
not be awarded against him
.
And in case the defendant
be found
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
(
the
trial
of
whichmay happen
in
his absence
),
a
capias may be awarded and issued
,
to
bring him
in
to
receive judgment
;
and
,
if
he absconds
,
he may
be
pro-
secuted even
to
outlawry

not universally allowed .
And in those particular
cases ,
the custom was for the bishop or ordinary
to demand his
clerks to be remitted out of the king's courts , as soon as
they were
indicted :
concerning
the
allowance
of which
demand there was for many years a great uncertainty (g) :
till at length it was finally settled in the reign of Henry
VI. , that
the
prisoner
should first be arraigned
; and
might
either then
claim
his benefit of clergy , by way of
declinatory plea ; or, after conviction , by way of arresting
judgment .
Originally
the law was , that no man should be admitted
to the privilege of clergy , but such as had the habitum et
tonsuram
clericalem (h) .
But in process of time a much
wider and more comprehensive
criterion
was established :
every one who could read (a mark of great
learning
in
those days of ignorance and her sister
superstition ) being
accounted
a clerk or clericus, and allowed
the benefit of
clerkship , though
neither
initiated
in holy
orders ,
nor
trimmed with the clerical
tonsure .
But when learning ,
by means of the invention
of printing ,
and other
con-
current causes , began to be more generally disseminated ;
and reading was no longer a competent proof of clerkship ,
or being in holy orders ; it was found
that as many lay-
men as divines were admitted to the privilegium
clericale :
and therefore by statute 4 Hen .
7 , c. 13 , a distinction
was
once more drawn
between mere lay scholars , and clerks
who were really in orders.
And
though it was thought
reasonable
still
to mitigate
the
severity of the law with
regard to the former , yet they were not put upon the same
footing with actual
clergy ;
being subjected
to
a slight
degree of punishment , and not allowed to claim the clerical
privilege
more
than
once .
Accordingly the
statute
directed that no person
once
admitted
to the benefit of
clergy , should
be admitted
thereto a second time , unless
he produced
his orders : and , in order to distinguish

real clergy , were discharged from the sentence of the law
in the temporal courts , and delivered over to the ordinary,
to be dealt with according
to the
ecclesiastical
canons .
Whereupon
the
ordinary , not
satisfied with the
proofs
adduced in the profane secular court , set himself formally
to work to make
a purgation
of the offender by a new
canonical
trial ;
although
he had been
previously
con
victed by his country , or perhaps by his own confession (k) .
This trial was held
before
the bishop
in
person ,
or his
deputy ; and by a jury of twelve clerks
and there , first ,
the party himself was required to make
oath of his own
innocence ; next , there was to be the oath of twelve com
purgators , who swore
they believed he spoke the
truth ;
then , witnesses were to be examined
upon
oath , but
on
behalf of the prisoner only ; and lastly , the jury were to
bring in their verdict
upon
oath , which usually acquitted
the prisoner ; otherwise , if a
clerk , he was degraded ,
or
put to penance ( ).

THE SENTENCE ,
ETC.
467
The
scandalous
prostitution
of oaths and the forms of
justice , in the almost constant acquittal of felonious clerks
by purgation , was the
occasion
, that , upon very heinous
and notorious circumstances of guilt , the temporal
courts
would not trust the ordinary with the trial of the offender,
but delivered
over to him the convicted clerk , absque pur
gatione facienda
:
in which
situation
the
clerk
convict
could not make purgation
; but was to continue in prison
during life, and was incapable
of acquiring
any personal
property , or receiving the profits of his lands , unless the
crown
should
please to pardon him.
And the stat .
18
Eliz . c. 7, enacted that , for the avoiding of such perjuries
and abuses , after the offender had been allowed his clergy ,
he
should
not
be delivered
to the
ordinary ,
as before
;
but, upon such allowance and burning in the hand , should
forthwith be enlarged
and delivered out of prison ; with
proviso , that
the judge might, if he thought
fit
,
continue
the
offender
in
gaol for any time not
exceeding
a
year
.
And
thus
the law continued
unaltered
,
except
in
some
unimportant
particulars
(
m),
for above
a
century
.
Afterwards
indeed
it
was
considered
,
that
education
and learning
afforded
no
extenuation
of
guilt
,
but quite
the
reverse
and that
,
if
the
punishment
of death for
simple
felony
was
too severe for those who
had
been
liberally instructed
,
it
was
,
a
fortiori
,
too severe
for the
ignorant
also
.
And thereupon by the
5
Ann
.
c.
6,
it
was
enacted
,
that the benefit
of
clergy should
be
granted
to
all
those who were entitled
to
ask
it
,
without
requiring
them
to
read by way
of
conditional
merit
,
and by the stat
.

,
it
was further enacted that instead of
burning
in

(
which was sometimes too slight and
sometimes too disgraceful
a
punishment
),
the court
in
all
clergyable
felonies
might
impose
a
pecuniary
fine
;
or
(
except
in
the
case
of
manslaughter
)
might order
the
offender

THE TRIAL .
Moving in
arrest of
consequences
as burning in the hand ; and in this state did
the benefit of clergy stand , until it was abolished by the
statute 6 & 7 Geo. 4 , c. 28, s. 6.
From the preceding
detail we collect , that , however
in
times of ignorance and superstition
that monster in true
policy may for a while subsist , a body of men , residing in
the bowels of a state , independent of its laws ; yet , when
learning
and
rational
religion
have a little enlightened
men's
minds , society can no longer
endure
an absurdity
so gross, as must destroy
its
very fundamentals
.
For
,
by
the original
contract
of
government the price
of
protection
by the united force
of
individuals
is
that of obedience
to
the united will
of
the
community
.
This united will
is
declared
in
the laws of the land
;
and that united force
is
exerted in their due and universal
execution
.

a
defendant who appears
in

as
for want
of

in

which in one or other of the preceding
chapters
has
been
specified as annexed by law to the offence .
It is indeed
one of the glories of our English
law, that
the
species ,
though
not always the quantity
or degree
of punishment
is ascertained for every offence
; and that it is not left in
the breast of any judge , nor even
of
a jury , to alter
that
judgment , which the law has
beforehand
ordained , for
every
subject alike , without respect of persons .
For , if
judgments
were
to be the private opinions of the judge ,
men would
then
be
slaves
to
their
magistrates
; and
would
live
in society , without
knowing
exactly the con-
ditions and obligations
under which it lays them .
More-
over , as this prevents oppression
on the
one
hand , so on
the other it stifles hopes of impunity
or mitigation
; with
which an offender might flatter himself, if his punishment
depended
on the
humour
or
discretion
of
the
court .
Whereas ,
where
an
established
penalty
is
annexed
to
a crime , the criminal
may read its certain
consequence
in
that law ; which ought to be the
unvaried rule , as it is
the
inflexible
judge , of his
actions .
Even
a voluntary
forgiveness , by the party injured , ought not in true policy
to intercept the stroke of justice .

THE
TRIAL .
said (s), " may be an act of good nature
and humanity ,
but it is contrary to the good of the public .
For , although
a private
citizen
may dispense with satisfaction
for his
private
injury, he cannot remove the necessity of public
example .
The right of punishing
belongs not to any one
individual
in particular , but to the society in general , or
the
sovereign who
represents
that
society :
and
a man
may renounce his own portion of this right , but he cannot
give up that of others ."
Referring
to the earlier portions of this volume for the
punishment
attached
to
each
specific offence by our law,
some general
remarks
respecting judicial sentences
may
here be offered .
Wherever
sentence
is passed
for
felony
on a
person
already imprisoned under sentence
for another
crime , the
court may award imprisonment
for the subsequent offence ,
to commence at the expiration of the previous imprison-
ment ; and
where
the party is
already
under
sentence
of imprisonment
or penal
servitude , the court may award
punishment
for the subsequent
offence , to commence at
the
expiration
of
the
previous
sentence ,
although
the
aggregate
term of imprisonment
or penal
servitude may
exceed
the term
for
which
either
of those punishments
could be otherwise awarded (t).
In the
case of a felony
punishable
under
any
one of
the Criminal Law Consolidation
and Amendment
Acts , a
principal
in the second
degree and an accessory
before the
fact is punishable
in like manner
as a principal
in the
first degree (u).
An accessory after the fact to murder
is
punishable
with penal servitude for life or not less than five years , or
with imprisonment
for
not more than two years with or
without hard labour (x).

THE
SENTENCE ,
ETC.
471
An accessory after the fact to any other felony (y) pun-
ishable under
one of the acts above mentioned , may be
sentenced
to imprisonment
for any term not exceeding
two years with or without hard
labour : and in
certain.
cases with or without
solitary
confinement (~) .
Whosoever
counsels or aids the commission of an in-
dictable
misdemeanor
punishable
under
any of the
said
acts , is punishable
as a principal offender (a) .
Further , with reference to the
sentence
which
may be
passed upon a person who
has been convicted of an in-
dictable offence
under any of the last -mentioned
acts , it is
provided that:-
1. Whenever
imprisonment
,
with
or
without
hard
labour , may be awarded for such offence , the court may
sentence the
offender to be imprisoned
in the common
gaol or house of correction ( ) .
2.
Whenever
solitary confinement
may be awarded for
such offence, the court may direct the offender to be kept
in solitary
confinement for any portion
or portions of his
imprisonment , not exceeding one month at any one time ,
and not exceeding three months in any one year (c) .
3. Whenever
whipping
may be awarded for any such
offence , the court
may sentence the offender to be once
privately whipped ; and the number
of strokes , and the
instrument with which
they are to be inflicted , shall
be
specified in the sentence by the court (d).
The discretionary
fines which our courts are sometimes.
enabled to
impose , may seem an exception
to the rule
before stated, that punishment
should be fixed

THE TRIAL .
:
minate
the amount of a fine , however, may properly vary
according to the aggravations
or otherwise of the offence,
the quality and condition of the parties , and from other
circumstances .
It neither
can, nor
ought
to,
be ascer
tained by any invariable
law.
The value of money
itself
changes from a thousand causes
: and , at all events , what
is ruin to one man's fortune , may be matter of indiffer
ence to another's (e).
Our
statute law has not
therefore
often ascertained the quantity of fines ; for instance , we
have already seen
that
when
any person has
been con
victed of an indictable
misdemeanor
punishable
under
any of the Criminal Law Consolidation
and
Amendment
Acts (f) , the court may , in addition
to , or in lieu of, any
punishment by the particular
act authorised , inflict a fine
upon the offender , the amount
or limit whereof has not
been determined
by the
legislature .
Neither
does
the
common law affix a precise limit to the pecuniary
mulct
which , as in the case of a misdemeanor , it sometimes allows
to be imposed
it directs such an offence to be punished by
fine in general , without
specifying
the certain sum :
and
this is
sufficient , when
we
consider ,
that
however un
limited
the
power of the
court may seem , it is far from
being wholly arbitrary
; but its discretion
is regulated by
law.
For the Bill of Rights (9) has particularly
declared ,
that excessive
fines ought not to be imposed , nor cruel and
unusual
punishments
inflicted
: (which had a retrospect
to some unprecedented proceedings in the court of king's
bench , in the reign of king James the Second :)
and the
same statute
further
declares, that all grants
and pro
mises of fines and forfeitures of particular
persons before
(e) Thus the
law of the
twelve
tables
at Rome
fined
every person ,
who struck another , five and twenty
denarii ; this , in the
more opulent
days of the
empire , grew to be a
punishment
of so little
considera
tion , that Aulus Gellius tells a story
of one Lucius Neratius , who made it
his
diversion
to
give
a
blow
to
whomsoever
he pleased,
and then
tender him the legal forfeiture .

:

Now the Bill of Rights
was only declaratory of the
old constitutional
law
and
accordingly
we find
it expressly holden , long
before (h) ,
that
all such
previous
grants
are
void ;
since thereby
many times
undue
means , and more violent prosecution ,
might be used for private lucre , than the quiet and just
proceeding of law would permit .
The reasonableness of fines in criminal
cases has also
been generally
regulated by the determination
of Magna
Carta , c.
14 , concerning
amercements for misbehaviour
by the suitors in matters of civil right.
" Liber homo non
amercietur pro parvo
delicto , nisi secundum
modum ipsius
delicti ; et pro magno
delicto , secundum
magnitudinem de
licti ;
salvo
contenemento
suo :
et
mercator
eodem
modo ,
salvá mercandisa sud ;
et villanus
eodem modo
amercietur,
salvo nainagio
suo ."
A rule that obtained even in Henry
the Second's time (i) , and means only , that
no man shall
have a larger
amercement
imposed
upon him, than his
circumstances or personal estate will
bear : saving
to the
landholder
his contenement ( k) , or land : to the trader his
merchandize ; and to the
countryman
his
wainage , or
team and instruments of husbandry .
In
order to ascer
tain
which , the great
charter
directed that the amerce
ment should be set , ponatur , or reduced
to a certainty , by
the oath of good
and lawful men of the neighbourhood .
Which method , of liquidating
the amercement to a precise
sum , was usually performed in the superior courts by the
assessment or
affeerment
of the
coroner , a sworn
officer
chosen by the neighbourhood ,
under
the
equity of the
statute Westm .

the amount into the exchequer (7) .
But in the
court -leet
and court -baron it was performed by affecrors , or
suitors
sworn to affeere , that
is , tax and moderate
the
general
amercement according to the particular
circumstances of
the offence and the offender (m).
Amercements
imposed
by the superior courts on their own officers and ministers
were affeered by the judges
themselves ;
but
when
a
pecuniary mulet was inflicted by them on
a stranger (not
being party to any
suit ), it was
then
denominated
a
fine ( ~) ; and the ancient practice was , when any such fine
was imposed , to
inquire
by
a jury
" quantum
inde
regi
dare valeat per annum, salva
sustentatione
sud, et uxoris ,
et liberorum suorum " (o).
And since the disuse of such
inquest , it was never usual
to assess a larger fine than a
man might be able to pay , without touching
the imple-
ments of his
livelihood
: but to inflict corporal
punish-
ment , or a limited
imprisonment
, instead of such fine as
might amount to imprisonment
for life .
And this
is the
reason
why fines in the
superior
courts
were frequently
denominated ransoms , because
the penalty must otherwise
have fallen upon a man's person , unless it were redeemed
or
ransomed
by
a pecuniary
fine (p) : according
to
an
ancient maxim , qui non habet in crumenû
luat in corpore .
Under the
Larceny
Act (q) the
court before which
an
offender is tried
and
convicted for any
such felony
or
misdemeanor ,
as
therein
mentioned ,
is
empowered
to
award restitution (r) to the owner of the property
stolen ,
or wrongfully got from him ( s) , and this is usually
done
by an order of the court without
any writ of restitution
(t).
Also by the 30 & 31 Vict . c. 35 , s. 9, it has been provided

that
where
a prisoner
is convicted
of larceny
or
other
offence , which includes
the
stealing
of property , and it
appears that the prisoner
has sold the
stolen
property
to some
person
who
had
no knowledge
that
the
same
was stolen ,
the
court
may , on the application
of such
purchaser ,
and on restitution
of the stolen
property
to
the prosecutor , order that out of any money , which
may
have been taken from the prisoner
on his apprehension ,
a sum not exceeding the
amount of the proceeds
of the
said sale be delivered
to the purchaser (u) .
We have
seen
that , under
certain
circumstances , the
prosecutor
may ,
on
acquittal
of the
accused ,
be
ad-
judged
to pay the
costs
incurred
by him (x).
So ,
on
the
other hand , upon
a conviction
for assault , whether
with or without cutting
and wounding
or either of them ,
the person
convicted
may , in addition
to
any
sentence
which the
court
may
deem
proper
for
the
offence ,
be
adjudged
to pay to the prosecutor
the actual and neces-
sary
expenses
of the prosecution ,
and
such
moderate
allowance for the loss of time as the court shall ascertain
to be reasonable (y).
In a
case
of felony the court is further
empowered
by the

order payment

this

the rule oflaw
is " spoliatus

when the pro-

his power to convict

since the case is
reduced
to this

necessity ,
that
either

the law
prefers
the right

CHAPTER
XX.
I. Setting
aside or re-
versing
judgment .
1.New trial .
PROCEEDINGS
AFTER
THE
TRIAL .
THE proceedings subsequent to trial arrange themselves
under
two
heads :-I.
Such
as are taken
for avoiding ,
reversing , or setting aside the judgment . II. Such as are
consequential thereupon .
I. We will first briefly consider how the judgment
in a
criminal
case may be set aside.
There are several
ways
of doing
this , which
we will examine , first referring the
reader to what
has been already said (a) respecting
the
jurisdiction of the court of criminal
appeal upon
a
case
reserved at the trial for its consideration .
1. Where
the indictment
has
been
preferred in the
court of queen's
bench , or where it has been
removed
thither by certiorari , a new trial will
be granted by that
court in a case of misdemeanor or even of felony-as for
misdirection
or surprise (b) , or the improper admission of
evidence
(c)—to
further
the
ends of justice .
But
after
acquittal
on a charge of felony , or (with certain peculiar
exceptions (d) ) of misdemeanor , a new trial will not be
granted (e).

error.
2. For defects
of substance (f) apparent on the face of 2. Writ of
it, the judgment
may be reversed by writ of error (g) ;
which lies from all inferior
criminal
jurisdictions
to the
court of queen's
bench , and from
the queen's
bench
to
the court of exchequer chamber , and thence to the house
of lords.
It
may be
brought
for
notorious
mistakes
in the judgment or
other parts of the record : as where
a man found guilty of perjury
receives
the judgment
of
felony .
These writs of error , to reverse judgments
in
cases of
felony or misdemeanor , are not to be allowed of course ( ) ,
but , on sufficient
probable
cause
shown to the
attorney-
general , on his fiat (i) ; and then they are understood to
be grantable
of common
right , and
ex
debito justitiæ .
Such a writ if sued out collusively will be set aside ( k) .
Formerly, where the judgment
in
a criminal
case was
reversed
by the
court of queen's
bench on writ of error
from an inferior court , the court was bound to discharge
the prisoner , and could not remit the record to the court
below, that the
proper
sentence
might be pronounced
there .
But
now
on
reversing
judgment ,
the
court
of
error will pronounce
the proper judgment , or will
remit
the record to the court below , in order that such judgment
may be there pronounced (1).
During the pendency of the writ of error , the defendant
in a case of treason or felony , remains in custody , being
in execution
on
the judgment (m).
But in a
case
of
misdemeanor,
the
execution
will be
stayed ,
and
the
defendant will
be discharged
from
custody on entering

PROCEEDINGS
AFTER
THE TRIAL .
3. Reversal
ofjudgment
without
writ of
error.
4
Reversal
into recognizances
to prosecute the writ of error
with
effect, and personally
to appear in the court wherein such
writ may be
returnable
on the day when judgment
is
given thereupon (n).
A judgment reversed upon writ of error is the same in
contemplation of law as no judgment , and the defendant
may be again indicted (0).
3. A judgment may be falsified , reversed , or avoided ,
without a writ of error , for matters
foreign to or dehors
the record , that is , not
apparent
upon the face of it ; so
that
they
cannot
be assigned for error in the superior
court , which
can only judge
from what appears in the
record itself : and therefore , if the
whole
record be not
certified , or not truly certified , by the inferior
court , the
party
injured
thereby (in both civil and criminal cases )
may allege a diminution
of the record (p) , and cause it to
be rectified .
Thus , if any judgment
whatever
be given
by
persons , who
had
no
good
commission
to proceed
against the person
condemned , it is void ; and may be
falsified
by showing the special
matter
without writ of
error.
Ex. gr. , if a commission issues to A. and B. , and
twelve others , or any two of them of whom A. or B. shall
be one, to take and try indictments
; and any of the other
twelve
proceed without the interposition
or presence of
either A. or B.
in this case all proceedings , trials , con-
victions , and judgments
are
void
for
want of a proper
authority in the commissioners , and may be falsified upon
bare inspection without the trouble of a writ of error (g) ;
it being a high misdemeanor in the judges
so proceeding ,
and little (if anything ) short of murder
in them all , in
case the person so attainted
be executed
and suffer death.
4. An attainder may be reversed by act of parliament ,

parliament.
and this has been sometimes done , from motives of com- by
act
of
passion
,
or
perhaps through
the zeal
of
the times
,
after
a
sudden
revolution
in
the government
,
without
examining
too closely into the truth
or
validity
of
the errors assigned
.
Sometimes
,
though the crime has been universally
acknow-
ledged
and
confessed
,
yet
the
merits
of
the criminal's
family have after his death obtained
a
restitution
in
blood
,
honours
,
and
estate
,
or
some
,
or
one
of
them
,
by act
of
parliament
;
which
(
so
far
as
it
extends
)
has all the
effect
of
reversing
the
attainder
,
without
casting
any
reflections upon the justice
of
the preceding sentence
(r).
The
effect
of
reversing an outlawry
,
is
that
the party
shall
be
in
the same plight
as
if
he
had appeared upon
the capias
;
and
,
if
it
be
before plea
pleaded
,
he
shall
be put
to
plead
to
the
indictment
;
if
after conviction
,
he shall receive the sentence of the law
:
for all the other
proceedings
,
except only the
process
of
outlawry for his
non
-
appearance
,
remain good and effectual
as
before
.
But
when judgment
,
pronounced upon conviction
,
is
reversed
,
all former
proceedings
are absolutely
set aside
,
and the
party
stands
as
if
he had
never
been
at
all
accused
;
restored
in
his
credit
,
his capacity
,
his
blood
,
and
his
estates
:
with regard
to
which last
,
though they be granted
away by the crown
,
yet the owner may enter upon
the
grantee
,
with
as
little
ceremony
as
he might enter upon
a
disseisor
(s).
But he still
remains
liable
to
another
prosecution
for
the
same
offence
;
for
,
the first
being
erroneous
,
he
never was
in
jeopardy
thereby
(t).
The
only other remaining
ways
of
avoiding
the execu-
tion
of
the judgment
are by
a
reprieve
,
or
a
pardon
;
whereof the former
is
temporary
only
,
the latter
per-
manent

6. Pardon.
withdrawing
of a sentence for an interval of time ; whereby
its execution is suspended
.
This may be , first, ex man
dato regis, or from the mere pleasure of the
crown , ex
pressed to the
court
by whom
the
execution
is to be
awarded ;
secondly ,
ex
arbitrio
judicis ;
either
before
or after judgment : as , where
the judge is not
satisfied
with
the
verdict ,
or the
evidence
is
suspicious , or the
indictment
is
insufficient ;
or sometimes , if favourable
circumstances
appear in the criminal's
character , in order
to give room to apply to the crown for either an absolute
or a conditional
pardon .
Reprieves
may also be ex necessitate
legis :
as ,
where
a woman
is
capitally
convicted ,
and pleads
her
preg
nancy (x) ; though
this is no cause to stay the judgment ,
yet it is to respite the execution till she be delivered .
This is a mercy dictated by the law of nature , in favorem
prolis ;
and, in
case
this
plea be made in
stay of exe
cution , the judge must
direct
a jury of twelve matrons ,
who are assisted by a surgeon , to inquire
as to the alleged
fact
and if they bring in their verdict quick with child ,
execution will
be
stayed generally till either
she is de
livered ,
or proves by the
course of nature
not to have
been with child .
Another ground
for a reprieve already
treated of may be insanity (y).
6. If
no
special
reason
can
be
adduced to
avoid
the judgment or to stay the execution of it , the last and
surest
resort is to the crown for pardon ;
the granting
of which is indeed its
most
amiable
prerogative .
Law
cannot be framed
on principles
of compassion to guilt
:
yet justice , by the
constitution
of England , is to be ad
ministered in mercy ; this was promised by the sovereign
in her coronation
oath .
The queen herself condemns no
man ; that rugged task she leaves to her courts of justice :
(x) It is
usual
for the clerk of
assize to ask
women , who
receive
sentence of death , if they have any
thing to
say why execution
shall
not be
awarded
according
to the
judgment.

PARDON .

the great operation of her sceptre is mercy.
The power
of pardoning
inherent
in the
sovereign was said by our
Saxon ancestors (2) to be derived a lege suæ dignitatis
: and
it is enacted by statute 27
Hen . 8 ,
c. 24,
s . 1 , that no
other person
shall
have power
to pardon
or remit any
treason
or
felony
whatsoever :
but that the king shall
have the whole and
sole power
and authority
thereof ,
united and knit to the imperial
crown of this realm .
This is indeed one especial advantage of monarchy as a
form of government , that there is a magistrate , who has
it in his power to extend mercy wherever it is found to be
deserved, and to soften the rigour of the general law, in
any such
criminal case
as may merit an exemption from
punishment .
Pardons
(according to some theorists (a) )
should be excluded in a perfect legislation , where punish-
ments
are mild
but
certain :
for the
clemency
of the
prince
seems
tacitly to imply
a
disapprobation
of the
laws .
But the exclusion of pardons must
necessarily in-
troduce a very dangerous power in the judge or jury , that
of construing
the criminal
law by its spirit instead of its
letter (6)
or else it must
be held , which no man would
seriously
maintain , that the situation
and circumstances
of the offender (though they
alter not the essence of the
crime ) ought to make no distinction
in the punishment .
In
a pure
democracy this power of pardoning
cannot
subsist ;
for there
nothing
higher is acknowledged
than
the magistrate
who
administers
the laws
and it would
be impolitic for the power of judging and of pardoning
to
centre in one and the same person .
This would oblige
him very often to contradict himself, to make and to un-
make his decisions : it would tend to confound all ideas of
right among the mass of the people ;
as they would find
it difficult to tell , whether a prisoner were discharged by
his
innocence , or obtained a pardon
through
favour (c).
But in a monarchy
the king acts in a superior
sphere ;

and , though
theoretically
he regulates the whole govern
ment , yet he does
not appear in any of the disagreeable
or invidious
parts of it.
Whenever
the public
sees him
personally
engaged, it is
only in works
of legislation
,
magnificence ,
or
compassion .
To
him
therefore
the
people look up as the fountain of nothing but bounty and
grace ;
and these repeated
acts of goodness , coming im
mediately from his own hand , endear the sovereign to his
subjects , and contribute
more than any thing to root in
their
hearts
that filial
affection , and
personal
loyalty ,
which are the surest establishment of a prince .
Under the
head of pardon , let us very briefly
con
sider , (1) The object of pardon :
(2) The manner of par
doning ,
and
extent
of
pardon
:
(3)
The
method
of
allowing
a
pardon :
(4 )
The
effect
of a pardon
when
allowed .
(1) The crown may pardon
any offence
merely against
itself or the public
; excepting , that to preserve
the liberty
of the subject , the committing
any man to prison
out of
the realm , is by the
Habeas Corpus
act, 31 Car. 2 , c. 2,
made a præmunire , unpardonable
even by the sovereign .
Nor can the crown pardon , where private justice is princi
pally concerned
in
the
prosecution
of offenders
: " non
potest rex gratiam facere cum injuria et damno aliorum
(d). "
Neither can the crown pardon the person guilty of main
taining
a common nuisance , while it remains unredressed ,
or so
as to prevent
an abatement of it, but the fine it
seems may be remitted ;
because , though the prosecution
is vested in the crown to avoid multiplicity of suits , yet
(during its continuance ) this offence
savours more of the
nature of a private injury to each individual in the neigh
bourhood , than of a public
wrong (e).
Neither , lastly ,
can the crown (in general ) pardon
an
offence
against
a
penal statute , after information
laid (ƒ) : for thereby the

informer
has acquired an inchoate
property in his part of
the penalty (g).
There is also a restriction
of a peculiar
nature , which
affects the prerogative of pardoning , in the case of a par
liamentary impeachment
: viz . that a pardon by the crown
cannot
be pleaded
to any
such
impeachment ,
so
as to
impede the inquiry, and stop the prosecution
of a great
and notorious offender.
Therefore when , in the
reign of
Charles II. , the earl of Danby was
impeached by the
house of commons of high treason ,
and
other
misde
meanors , and
pleaded the king's
pardon in bar of the
same (h), the commons alleged ( ) ,
" that there was no
precedent that ever any pardon was granted to any person
impeached by the commons of high treason , or other high
crimes ,
depending
the
impeachment
; " and
thereupon
resolved (k), " that the pardon
so pleaded was illegal and
void , and ought not to be allowed in bar of the impeach
ment of the commons of England ; " for which resolution
they assigned (1) this reason
to the house of lords , " that
the setting up a pardon to be a bar of an impeachment
defeats the whole
use and
effect
of impeachments ; for
should this point be admitted , or stand doubted , it would
totally discourage
the
exhibiting
any for the future ;
whereby the chief institution
for the preservation
of the
government would
be destroyed."
Soon after the revo
lution ,
the
commons
renewed
the
same
claim ,
and
voted (m), " that a pardon is not pleadable in bar of an
impeachment ."
And at length , it was enacted by the act
of settlement , 12 &
13 Will . 3 , c. 2, " that no pardon
. under the great seal of England
be pleadable to an im
peachment by the
commons in parliament ."
But , when
the
impeachment
has
been
solemnly
heard
and deter
mined , it is not understood that the royal grace is further

restrained or abridged ; thus , after the impeachment and
attainder of the six rebel lords , A. D. 1715 , three of them
were from time to time
reprieved
by the crown , and
at
length received the benefit of the king's most gracious
pardon (n).
Moreover , when the lords have delivered their
sentence of guilty , the commons
have virtually the power
of pardoning the impeached convict , by refusing to demand
judgment
against him , for no judgment can be pronounced
by the lords till it is demanded by the commons (0).
(2) . A pardon may either be absolute or conditional
: that
is, the queen
may extend her mercy upon what terms she
pleases ; and may annex to her bounty a condition
either
precedent or subsequent , on the performance
whereof
the
validity
of the pardon will depend : and this
prerogative
is not unfrequently
exerted , through
the home secretary,
in the pardon of felons , or misdemeanants .
(n) The royal prerogative
of par-
doning
a delinquent
convicted
on
impeachment
is
acknowledged
by
the commons
and
asserted
by the
crown in the following remarkable
record -Item prie la

An effective
pardon from the crown must formerly have
been under the great seal (p) , but now a warrant under the
royal sign manual , countersigned
by one of the principal
secretaries of state, granting
a free pardon , or a condi
tional pardon with the performance of such condition , is
equally effectual (q) .
(3. ) A pardon by act of parliament
is thus far more bene
ficial than a pardon by the queen , that a man is not bound
to plead it, but the court must
ex officio
take
notice of
it (r)
neither
can he lose the benefit of it by his
own
laches or negligence , as he may of the queen's
pardon (s) .
The queen's pardon
must
be specially pleaded , and that
at
a proper
time : for if a man is indicted , and has a
pardon in his pocket , and afterwards
puts himself upon
his trial by pleading the general issue , he has waived
the
benefit of such pardon (t) .
But , if a man avails himself
thereof as soon
as by course of law he may , a pardon may
either be pleaded upon arraignment , or in arrest of judg
ment , or in bar of execution .
(4. ) Lastly , the
effect of a pardon
by the crown , is to
make the offender a new man , and to acquit him of all
penalties
and forfeitures annexed to the
offence
for which
he obtains pardon .
But nothing
can restore or purify the
blood when
once
corrupted , if the pardon be not allowed
till after
attainder ,
except the
high
and
transcendent
power of parliament .

PROCEEDINGS
AFTER THE TRIAL .
1. For-
feiture.
1. By attainder
for treason , a man
forfeits
absolutely
to the crown all his lands
and tenements of inheritance ,
whether in fee simple or fee tail, and all rights of entry
thereon , which he had at , or after , the time of committing
the
offence , and also the profits of lands
and
tenements ,
which he had in his own right for life or years , so long as
such interest shall subsist (x). This forfeiture relates back-
wards to the time of the treason
committed
;
so
as to
avoid all intermediate
sales
and incumbrances
(y) .
But ,
though after attainder
the
forfeiture
relates
back to the
time of the treason committed , yet it does not take effect
unless an attainder be had , of which it is one of the fruits ;
and therefore , if a traitor
dies
before
judgment
pro-
nounced , or is killed in open rebellion , this works no for-
feiture
of his
lands :
for
he
never
was
attainted
of
treason (2).
All personal
property
of the
traitor
vests
on his at-
tainder in the crown (a).
Arguments
justifying
the forfeiture
or confiscation of
property for high treason have been founded on these con-
siderations that he who has thus violated the fundamental
principles
of government , has abandoned his
connection
with society ; and has no longer any right to those advan-
tages , which before belonged to him purely as a member of
the community
; among which social advantages , the right
of transferring
or transmitting
property to others is
one
for treason is said to be attaint , at-
tinctus , stained , or blackened , and
by an anticipation
of his
punish-
ment , is already dead in law (3 Inst.
213) .
This
is after judgment
: for ,
after
conviction
only ,
a
man
is
liable to no such disability as men-
tioned in the text ; since
there is
still , in contemplation
of law, a pos
sibility of his innocence .

of the chief ; also that the apprehension of such forfeiture ,
whereby his posterity must suffer as well as himself, will
help to restrain a man from committing
crime ; and will
interest every dependent and relative
he has to keep him
from offending : according to the sentiment of Cicero (b) ,
" nec
vero
me fugit
quam
sit
acerbum
,
parentum
scelera
filiorum pœnis
lui
:
sed hoc præclare
legibus comparatum
est
,
ut
caritas liberorum amiciores parentes reipublicæ red
deret
."
Indeed
the
only plausible
ground
of
upholding
forfeiture for crime
seems
to
be that all property
is
de
rived from
society
,
being
one
of
those civil rights
which
are conferred upon
individuals
,
in
exchange for that de
gree
of
natural freedom
,
which
every man
must
sacrifice
when he enters
into
a
social
community
.
If
therefore
a
member of the
state
violates
the
so called
fundamental
contract
of
his association
,
by transgressing
the municipal
law
,
he forfeits his right
to
such privileges
as
he might
claim
under that contract
;
and the
state
may justly
resume such property
,
or
any part
of
it,
as
the law had
before
assigned
to
him
.
Nevertheless
all
posthumous
punishment
savours
of
hardship
to
the innocent
;
and
must especially
do
so
when applied
to
crimes which do not
strike
at
the very root and foundation
of
society

ments to the crown for treason is by no means
derived
from the feudal
policy , but was transmitted
to us from
our Saxon ancestors (d) , and formed a part of the ancient
Scandinavian
constitution
(e) .
The
infliction of
such
a
penalty
is essentially opposed to the more just and merci
ful
views
now
prevalent ,
and an
effort
which
nearly
proved
successful was long since made to mitigate
the
severity of this law, and to abolish
entirely the heredi
tary
punishment
entailed by it, for it was
enacted by
statute 7 Ann . c . 21 , s . 10 , that , after the
decease
of the
pretender , and the efflux of three years from the demise
of the then sovereign , no attainder for treason should ex
tend to the disinheriting
of any heir , nor to the prejudice
of
any
person
other
than the
traitor
himself during
his lifetime .
By which , the law of forfeitures
for high
treason would by this time have been at an end, had not
a subsequent
statute intervened
to give
them
a longer
duration .
The history
of this matter
is somewhat sin
gular , and
worthy of observation .
At the time of the
union with Scotland , the
crime
of treason was, by the
Scotch law, in many respects different from that
in Eng
land ; and particularly
in its consequence
of working the
forfeiture of entailed
estates , which was more peculiarly
English ; yet it seemed
necessary, that a crime so nearly
affecting government should , both in its essence and con
sequences
, be put upon the
same
footing in both parts of
the united
kingdom .
In new-modelling
these laws , the
Scotch nation and the English
house of commons strug
gled
hard , respectively to maintain
and to acquire a total
immunity from forfeiture
and corruption of blood ; which
the house of lords
as firmly resisted .
At length
a com
promise
was agreed
to,
and
established by the above
mentioned
statute (ƒ) , viz . that the same crimes , and no
other , should be treasons in Scotland that are so in Eng

land ; and that the English
forfeitures
and corruption of
blood should take place in Scotland till the death of the
pretender , and the expiration of three years after the next
succession to the
crown ; and then
cease throughout
the
whole of Great
Britain (g) : the lords
artfully proposing
this temporary
clause , in hopes
(it is said (h) ) that the
prudence of succeeding
parliaments
would
make it per
petual (i) , and this was partly done by the statute 17 Geo. 2,
c.
39,
s .
3, which
further
suspended the
operation of
the clauses
specified till the death of the sons of the pre
tender .
However , by the
39
Geo . 3,
c.
93 , the
above
mentioned clauses in the
7 Ann . c. 21 , and the 17 Geo . 2 ,
c. 39, limiting
the
periods
when
forfeiture
for treason
should
be abolished , were repealed , and the law of for
feiture , in the case of high treason , is now the same
as it
was by the common law, or as it stood prior to the seventh
year of the reign
of Queen
Anne .
It is nevertheless
proper to apprize
the reader that the rigour
of the law
of
forfeiture
generally
is in
practice
much
tempered
in
virtue
of certain
modern
enactments ,
for
lands
to
which the
crown
becomes
entitled " by reason of any
forfeiture ," may under the provisions of stat . 59
Geo. 3,
c . 94 (k), be granted
either
unconditionally
or

sideration

may

to direct , and the

tion
of blood
caused by the attainder , and on
sentence
passed
for felony generally the offender forfeits his chattel
interests absolutely , and the profits of estates
of freehold
during life.
On attainder for murder , moreover , the felon's
lands in fee simple (but not those in tail ) pass to the crown ,
for a short period of time : for the king shall have them for
a year and a day, and may commit therein what waste he
pleases
; which is called the king's year , day , and waste (1) ,
and at the present day is usually compounded for.
For-
merly the king had only a liberty of committing
waste on
the lands of felons , by pulling down their houses , extirpa-
ting their gardens , ploughing
their meadows , and cutting
down their woods.
But this tending greatly to the pre-
judice of the
public , it
was
agreed, in the
reign
of
Henry I. , that the king should
have the profits
of the
felon's land for one year and a day , in lieu of the destruc-
tion he was otherwise
at liberty
to
commit
(m) :
and
therefore
Magna
Carta
(n) provides , that
the king
shall
only hold such lands
for
a year and
a day ,
and
then
restore them to the lord of the fee ; without any mention
made of waste.
But the statute 17 Edw . 2 de præroga-
tiva regis, seems
to suppose, that the king shall
have his
year , day , and waste ; and not the year and day instead of
waste.
Which sir Edward
Coke
(and the author of the
Mirror before him) very justly look upon as an encroach-
ment , though
a very ancient
one , of the royal
preroga-
tive (o) .
This year , day, and waste , if not compounded
for , regularly
belong to the crown : and , after their expi-
ration , the land would
naturally
have
descended
to the
heir (as in gavelkind tenure it still does ) , did not its feudal
quality
intercept
such descent, and give it by way of
escheat
to the lord (p).
These forfeitures for felony arise
only upon attainder ; and therefore a felo de se forfeits no
lands
of inheritance
or freehold , for he never

tainted
as a felon (q) .
They , as well as forfeitures
for
treason, relate back to the time of the offence
committed ;
so as to avoid
all intermediate
charges and conveyances
.
No mention
is here made of the particular
forfeitures
created by the statutes of præmunire ,
because
they may
be looked
upon
rather
as
a part of the judgment and
penalty inflicted thereunder , than as consequences
of such
judgment .
But I may just
mention
that the profits of
lands
are forfeited
during
life
in two other
instances ,
besides
those
already
spoken
of :
viz .
misprision
of
treason (r) , and striking in Westminster -hall, or drawing
a weapon upon a judge there sitting (s).
The forfeiture of goods and chattels (t)
accrues
in high
treason or misprision
thereof , also (with certain statutory
exceptions (u) ) in felony and self murder , and the above
mentioned
offences
of
striking,
&c.
in
Westminster-
hall (x).
Formerly also on an accusation of treason, or
felony , whether the party were found guilty or acquitted ,
if the jury found
that
he had
fled , the
accused
for-
feited his goods and chattels :
for the very flight
was
regarded
as
an
offence , carrying
with it a strong pre-
sumption of guilt , and ,
as
an endeavour to elude and
stifle the
course of justice
prescribed by the law.
But
the jury very
seldom
found
the flight (y) :
forfeiture
being looked
upon as too severe
a penalty for an offence ,
to which
a
man was prompted
by his natural
love of
liberty .
And now by the stat. 7 & 8 Geo . 4 , c. 28, s . 4 ,
where a person is indicted for treason or felony , the jury

inquire
concerning
his lands ,
tenements , or goods , nor
whether he fled for such treason or felony .
A remarkable
difference
or two must here be noticed
between the forfeiture
of lands
and that of goods
and
chattels .
(1. )
Lands
are forfeited upon attainder : goods
and chattels
are forfeited
by conviction ( ) ;
indeed in
many cases where goods are forfeited , there
is no attain
der ;
which happens
only where judgment of
death
or
outlawry is given ;
therefore in those
cases the forfeiture
must be upon conviction , or not at all ; and , being neces
sarily upon conviction in those , it is so ordered in all other
cases , for the law loves uniformity.
(2. ) In outlawry for
treason
or felony , lands
are forfeited
only by the judg
ment
but the goods and chattels are forfeited by a man's
being
first put in the exigent , without
staying till he is
finally outlawed .
(3.) The forfeiture of lands has relation to the time of
the fact committed ,
so
as to avoid all subsequent sales
and
incumbrances ;
but
the
forfeiture
of
goods
and
chattels
has
no
relation
backwards
; so that
those only
which a man has at the time of conviction
shall be for
feited .
Therefore
a
traitor
or felon
may bonâ fide (a)
sell
any of his chattels , real
or personal , for the sus
tenance of himself and family between the fact and con
viction (b) ;
for personal
property
is of so
fluctuating
a
nature , and
passes
through
so
many
hands in a short
time , that no buyer could be
safe , if he were liable to re
turn the goods which he had fairly bought , provided any
of the prior vendors had committed a treason
or felony .
Yet if the
goods were collusively , and
not
bona fide ,
parted with merely to defraud the crown , the law would
(2) By conviction
of
a felon , his
goods and chattels are forfeited , but
by attainder , that is by judgment
given , his lands
and tenements are
forfeited
and his blood
corrupted ,

remarkable
consequence
of attainder
for 2. Corrup-
high treason
or murder
is corruption of blood , to which
blood.
we have sufficiently
adverted in our second Volume (c) .
ment.
The various
punishments
annexed to
offences
having
Punish-
from time to time been specified in the preceding pages ,
and
some
remarks
having
likewise
been made as to the
sentence to be passed
by the
presiding
judge
upon the
convicted person (d) , we need here only repeat that where
such sentence adjudges capital
punishment (e), the sheriff
cannot
alter
the manner of its execution by substituting
one kind
of death for another , without
being guilty of
felony
himself (ƒ) .
It is held , indeed , by
sir
Edward
Coke
(g)
and sir Matthew
Hale
(
h),
that
even the crown
cannot
change the punishment
of
the law
,
as
by altering
hanging into beheading
;
though
,
when beheading
is
part
of
the
sentence
,
the crown may remit the rest
(i).
And
,
notwithstanding
some examples
to
the contrary
,
sir Ed-
ward Coke stoutly maintains
,
that
"
judicandum
est

non exemplis
."
Others
,
however
,
have thought
(j
),
and
more justly
,
that
this
prerogative
,
being
founded
in
mercy
,
and immemorially
exercised by the crown
,
is
part
of the common law
.
For
,
hitherto
,
in
every instance
,
such
exchange
has
been for
a
more
merciful
kind of
death
;
and how far this may also fall within the power
of
the crown
to
grant
a
conditional
pardon
,
(
viz
.
by remitting
a
severe
kind of death
,
on condition
that the
criminal
submits
to
a
milder
),
is

PROCEEDINGS
AFTER THE TRIAL .
was executed for the popish
plot in the reign
of king
Charles II. , the then
sheriffs of London , having
received
the king's writ for beheading him, petitioned the house of
lords
for a command
or order from their lordships , how
the
said judgment should
be
executed ;
for , he being
prosecuted by
impeachment , they
entertained
a notion
(which is said to have been countenanced by lord
Russel )
that the king could not pardon any part of the sentence
(k) .
The lords
resolved (1)
that
the
scruples of the
sheriffs
were unnecessary , and declared that the king's writ ought
to be
obeyed .
Disappointed
of raising
a flame
in
that
assembly , they immediately
signified (m) to the
house of
commons
by one of its
members , that
they
were
not
satisfied
as to the power of the
said writ.
That
house
took two days
to
consider of it ; and
then (n )
sullenly
resolved that the house was content that the sheriff
do
execute lord Stafford , by severing his head from his body.
It is further related , that when
afterwards the same lord
Russel was condemned for high treason upon indictment ,
the king , while
he remitted the ignominious
part of the
sentence , observed
, " that his lordship
would now find he
was possessed of that prerogative , which in the case of lord
Stafford he had denied him " (o) .
One can hardly deter-
mine (distant
as we are from those turbulent
times) which
most to disapprove of, the indecent and sanguinary zeal of
the subject , or the cool and cruel sarcasm of the sovereign .
In concluding this chapter it may be well to take note
of a recent most
salutary statute (p), which
enacts inter
alia as follows : that judgment
of death shall
henceforth
be executed on
any prisoner
sentenced
on
an

CHAPTER
XXI.
THE
RISE AND
PROGRESS
OF THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
In this chapter (a) is attempted a brief historical
review
of the most
remarkable
changes
and alterations
that
have happened in the law of England ; first, however , the
student
must
be reminded that the rise and progress of
many of its doctrines have been already pointed out in the
course of
these
Commentaries ,
under
their
respective
divisions : these having been already particularly
discussed
will not here be re-examined with any degree of minute
ness .
What I at present
purpose is rather to mark out
some outlines of an English juridical
history , by taking
a chronological
view of the state of our laws , and their
successive mutations
at different periods of time .
The several periods , under which the state of our legal
polity will be considered , are the following : I. From the
earliest
times to the
Norman
conquest : II. From the
Norman
conquest to the
reign
of
king
Edward I.:
III. From
thence to the
reformation : IV.
From
the
reformation
to
the
restoration
of
king
Charles II.:
V. From
thence to the revolution
in
1688 : VI. From
the revolution
to the passing
of the Reform
Act , A.D.
1832
and VII . From the passing of the Reform Act to
the present time .

ANCIENT BRITISH LAWS .
499
I. And , first , with regard
to the ancient
Britons , the
aborigines of our island , we have so little handed down
to us concerning
them with any tolerable
certainty , that
our inquiries
here must
needs
be very fruitless
and de-
fective .
However , from Cæsar's
account of the
tenets
and discipline
of the Druids
in Gaul, in whom
centered
all the learning of these western
parts , and who were, as
he tells us , sent over to Britain (that is, to the island of
Mona or Anglesey ), to be
instructed
;
we may
collect
some few affinities
and resemblances to our English law .
The very notion
indeed of an oral unwritten
law, delivered
down from age to
age , by custom
and tradition
merely ,
may have been derived from the practice of the Druids ,
who seem never to have committed
any of their instruc-
tions to writing , possibly for want of letters ; since it is
remarkable
that in none of the antiquities , unquestion-
ably British , which the industry of modern archæologists
has
discovered , is the
least
trace of any
character
or
letter to be found .
The
partible
quality
also of lands
by the custom of gavelkind , which
still
obtains in some
parts of England ,
and did
universally
over
Wales
till
the
reign
of Henry VIII . ,
is
undoubtedly
of British
origin .
The various
nations which
successively broke in upon
and destroyed the British
inhabitants
and constitution
,
the Romans , the Picts , and , after them , the various clans
of Saxons
and Danes , must necessarily have caused con-
fusion and uncertainty
in the laws and antiquities of the
kingdom
; forasmuch
as they became
gradually
incorpo-
rated and blended
together , and therefore , we may sup-
pose , communicated
to each other their respective usages ,
regarding the rights
of property and the punishment
of
crimes .
It is therefore
morally
impossible
to trace
out ,
with any degree of accuracy, when the several mutations
of the common
law were made , or whence
respectively
originated those several customs which we at present use ,
by any chemical
resolution
of them into their first and
KK 2

.
component
principles .
We can seldom pronounce , that
this custom was derived from the
Britons
; that was left
behind by the Romans ; this was a necessary precaution
against the Picts ;
that
was introduced
by the
Saxons ,
discontinued
by the
Danes , but afterwards
restored
by
the Normans .
Wherever
this can be done, it is matter of great curio
sity , and some use : but it can rarely be done, partly for
the reason above -mentioned ,
and also for the following
reasons.
First, from
the
nature
of traditional
laws in
general ; which , being accommodated to the exigencies of
the times , suffer by degrees
insensible variations in prac
tice
so that, though upon
comparison we may plainly
discern the alteration
of
a law from what it was five
hundred years ago, yet it may be impossible to define the
precise period in which
that alteration
occurred , any more
than
we can discern the
changes of the bed of a river,
which varies its shores by continual
decreases
and allu
vions .
Secondly , this
becomes
impracticable
from the
antiquity
of the kingdom
and its
government :
which
alone , though it had been disturbed
by no foreign inva
sions, would make it impossible successfully to search out.
and to fix with certainty the
origin of its laws .
Thirdly ,
this uncertainty
as to the
true source of particular
cus
toms
must
also
in part have arisen
from the
means
whereby Christianity was propagated
among
our
Saxon
ancestors in this
island
; by learned
foreigners
brought
over from
Rome and other countries , who doubtless car
ried with them many of their own national customs ; and
probably prevailed upon the state to abrogate such usages
as were inconsistent
with our religion , and to introduce
others that were more
conformable
thereto .
And this
perhaps may have partly been
the cause , that we find at
an early period rules not only of the mosaical , but also
of the
imperial
and pontifical
laws ,
blended
with
and
adopted into our own system .
A further reason
may
also
be
given
for the
great


ANCIENT

LAWS .
501
variety , and of course the uncertain origin , of our ancient
established
customs :
even
after the
Saxon government
was firmly established in this island : viz . the subdivision
of the
country into a heptarchy , consisting
of
seven in
dependent
kingdoms , peopled and governed by different
clans and colonies.
This must
have tended
to create
an
infinite diversity of laws : even though all those colonies ,
of Jutes , Angles , Anglo - Saxons , and the like , originally
sprung from the same mother -country , the great northern
hive ;
which
poured
forth
its
warlike
progeny ,
and
swarmed all over Europe , in the sixth
and seventh cen
turies .
A multiplicity of laws must necessarily be where
a kingdom
is cantoned out into provincial
establishments ;
not
under
one common
dispensation
of
laws ,
though
under
the
same
sovereign
power .
Much more must it
have existed where each of seven
unconnected
states
had
independently
to
form its
own
constitution
and super
structure of government , though
all these
states
began
to build upon the same or similar foundations .
When therefore the West Saxons had swallowed up all
the rest, and the
monarchy of England, whereof Egbert
was the founder , came into existence , a great
and neces
sary work was begun
and gradually
carried out , being no
less than the modelling of a constitution , the building of it
on a plan that should endure for ages , and the forming out
of many old discordant materials , which were heaped
upon
each other in a vast and rude irregularity
, of one uniform
and well connected whole ,
This was effected , by reducing
the kingdom
under
one regular
subordination of govern
ment , wherein
each man was answerable to his immediate
superior
for his
own
conduct
and that of his
nearest
neighbours
by the subdivision of England into tithings.
and hundreds , if not
into
counties ; all under the
in
fluence and administration
of
one supreme magistrate
;
in whom , as in a general reservoir , all the executive au
thority of the law was lodged , and from whom justice was
dispersed to every part of the
nation
by distinct ,

communicating , ducts and
channels : by collecting
the
various
customs dispersed throughout
the kingdom, and
reducing
and
digesting
them
into
one uniform system :
and by establishing
tribunals
for the trial of causes civil
and criminal ,
in
the very
districts
wherein
complaints
arose ; all of them
subject however to be inspected , con
trolled , and
kept within the bounds of the universal
or
common law, by the king's own courts ; which were then
itinerant , being held in the king's palace, and removing
with his household
in those
royal
progresses , which
he
continually
made from one end of the kingdom to
the
other .
The
Danish
invasion
and
conquest , which
introduced
new foreign
customs , dealt
a severe
blow to this
noble
fabric ; but a plan so excellently concerted could not be alto
gether thrown aside.
So that , upon the expulsion of these
intruders , the English returned for the most part to their
ancient law ; retaining , however, some few of the customs
of their late visitants ; which went under the name of Dane
Lage ; as the code compiled during the heptarchy was called
the West-Saxon - Lage ; and the local constitutions
of the
ancient kingdom
of Mercia , which
obtained in the coun
ties nearest to Wales, and probably
included
very
many
British
customs ,
were
called
the
Mercen-Lage .
And
these three collections
of laws were , about the beginning
of the eleventh century , in use in different counties of the
realm
the provincial
polity of counties , and their sub
divisions
not having
been
materially
altered or discon
tinued through the shocks and mutations
of government ,
though the laws and customs
therein
used, have (as we
shall
see ) often suffered
considerable changes.
:
For King Edgar observing the
ill
effects
of
three dis
tinct bodies
of
laws prevailing
at
once
in
separate parts
of his dominions
,
projected and begun what his grandson
king Edward
the
Confessor
afterwards
completed
;
viz
.
one uniform
digest
of
laws
to
be observed
throughout the
whole
kingdom
;
being
perhaps no more than

503
of some pre-existing
code , with improvements
suggested
by necessity and experience ; particularly the incorpora-
ting some of the British or rather Mercian
customs , and
also such of the Danish as were reasonable and approved ,
into the West -Saxon -Lage , which
was still
the ground-
work of the whole .
And this
appears
to be the best
supported and most plausible
conjecture
(for
certainty is
not to be expected ) respecting the rise and origin of some
considerable portion of that admirable system of maxims
and unwritten customs which is now known to us
as the
common law.
Among the most
remarkable
features
of the
Saxon
system of government
and laws we may reckon ,
1.
The
holding of general assemblies of the principal and wisest
men in the nation : the wittena-gemote , or commune consi-
lium of the ancient Germans ; without
whose concurrence
no new law could
be made, or
old one altered .
2. The
election of their magistrates
by the
people ;
originally
even
that of their
kings , till
dear -bought
experience
evinced
the convenience and necessity of establishing
a
hereditary succession to the crown .
But the right of elect-
ing subordinate magistrates , their military officers or here-
tochs , their sheriffs , their
conservators of the
peace , their
coroners , their portreeves (since changed into mayors and
bailiffs ) , and even their tythingmen and borsholders at the
leet, was vested in the people , some till the Norman
con-
quest, others for two centuries after it, whilst some remain
so to this day .
3. The descent of the crown , when once a
royal family was established , upon nearly the
same
here-
ditary principles
upon which it has ever since continued :
only that , perhaps , in case of minority, the next of kin of
full age would ascend the throne , as king , and not as pro-
tector ; though , after
his
death, the
crown
immediately
reverted back to the heir .
4. The great paucity of capital
punishments
for a first offence
; even the most notorious
offender being allowed to commute his punishment
for a
fine
or weregild, or,
in default of payment ,
perpetual

bondage ;
to which
the benefit
of clergy
afterwards
in
some measure
succeeded
.
5. The
prevalence of certain
customs
and
military
services
which
much
resembled
those
under
the
feudal
constitution ,
but
yet
were
exempt from its rigorous hardships
; and which may have
been imported
by the
Saxons .
6.
That
estates
were
liable to forfeiture
for treason , but
that
the
doctrine
of
escheats
and corruption of blood
for felony , or any other
cause , was unknown .
7. The
descent of land to all the
males equally , without
any right of primogeniture
;
a
custom , which obtained among the Britons , was agreeable
to the Roman law, and continued among the
Saxons till
the
Norman
conquest ;
though
in some
respects
incon
venient ,
especially
destructive
to
ancient
families , and
prejudicial
to the maintenance of an intermediate
state
between the
prince and the
common
people.
8.
The
courts ofjustice consisted principally
of the county courts ,
and in cases of weight
or nicety the king's court before
himself in person , during
the
session of his parliament ,
which was usually held in different places, according
as he
kept the three
great
festivals
of Christmas , Easter , and
Whitsuntide .
In these county
courts
the
ecclesiastical
and civil jurisdictions
were blended together , the bishop and
the ealdorman or sheriff sitting in the same county court ;
and the decisions and proceedings therein were simple and
unembarrassed ; an advantage which will always
attend
the infancy of laws , but wears off as they gradually
advance
to maturity .
9. Trials , among a people who had a very
strong tincture
of superstition , were permitted
to be by
ordeal , by the corsned
, or morsel of execration , or by wager
of law with compurgators , if the party chose it ; but fre
quently a disputed
question
was settled in another tri
bunal composed of persons clothed with judicial authority
over whom the shirereeve
presided , though without
taking
part in their
decision , and by whom the evidence of the
litigants
and the testimony of the neighbourhood
were
entertained .
Thus stood the general frame of our polity


FROM
THE NORMAN
CONQUEST
TO
EDWARD
I.
505
at the time of the
Norman
invasion
; when the second
period of our legal history commences
.
II. This remarkable
event wrought
as great an altera
tion
in our laws , as it did in our ancient line of kings :
and though the alteration of the former was effected rather
by the consent
of the people than
by any right of con
quest , yet that consent seems to have been partly extorted
by fear , and partly given
without
apprehension of the
consequences
which afterwards ensued.
1. Among the first of these alterations we may reckon
the separation of the ecclesiastical from the civil courts :
effected in order
to ingratiate
the
new
king with the
popish clergy , who for some time before had been endea
vouring
all over Europe
to exempt themselves from the
secular power ; and whose demands the conqueror , like a
politic prince , thought it prudent to comply with , by reason
that their reputed sanctity had a great influence over the
minds of the people ; and because
all the little learning
of the times was engrossed into their hands , which made
them
necessary men , and by all means to be gained over
to his interests .
And this was the more easily effected ,
because , the disposal of all the episcopal sees being then
in the breast of the king , he had taken
care to fill them
with Italian and Norman
prelates .
2. Another violent alteration of the English constitution
consisted in the depopulation
of large districts , for the
purposes of the king's diversion
;
and subjecting
both
them , and the ancient forests of the kingdom , to the un
reasonable
severities of forest laws , imported
from
the
continent , whereby the
slaughter of a beast was made
almost
as penal
as the death of a man .
In the Saxon
times , though no person was allowed
to kill or chase the
king's deer, yet he might start any game, pursue , and kill
it, upon
his own
estate .
But the rigour of these new
constitutions
vested the sole property of all the game in
England in the crown ; and no man was entitled
to dis

OF

turb any fowl of the air , or any beast of the field , of such
kinds
as were specially reserved for the amusement of the
sovereign , without
express
licence from him, by the grant
of a chase
or
free-warren :
and those franchises
were
granted
as much with a view to preserve the
breed of
animals
as to indulge the subject .
By degrees
the forest
laws became
mitigated , and at length grew entirely obso
lete, yet from this root sprung
bastard slips , still known
to us as the game laws .
3. A third alteration
effected in the English laws was
by narrowing
the remedial influence of the county courts ,
the great seats of Saxon
justice , and extending
the ori
ginal jurisdiction of the king's justiciars to all kinds of
causes , arising in all parts of the kingdom .
To this
end
the aula regis, with its multifarious
authority , was erected ;
and
a capital justiciary was appointed , with powers
so
large and boundless , that he became
at length
a tyrant to
the people, and formidable
to the crown itself.
The con
stitution
of this
court , and the judges
themselves
who
presided there , were fetched from the duchy of Normandy
:
and the consequence
naturally
was, the ordaining
that all
proceedings in the king's courts
should
be carried on in
the Norman , instead of the English
language .
vision
the
more
necessary,
because
none of his Norman
justiciars
understood English ; but
as evident a badge of
slavery
as
ever
was
imposed
upon a conquered
people .
This lasted
till
king
Edward III.
obtained
a
double
victory , over the armies of France
in their own country ,
and their
language in our courts at home (b) .

; when , among
many other innovations

and
some for

worse , the

was one mischief
too
deeply rooted thereby , and which
this caution of king Edward
came
too late
to eradicate.
Instead
of the plain and
easy
method of
determining
suits in the
county courts , the
chicanes and subtilties of
Norman jurisprudence had taken
possession of the king's
courts , to which
every cause
of consequence
was drawn .
That age , indeed , was an
era of refinement
and
subtilty .
There is an active principle
in the human soul , which will
ever be
exerting
its faculties
to the
utmost
stretch , in
whatever
employment , by the accidents of time and place ,
the general
plan of education , or the customs and man-
ners of the age
and country , it may happen to find itself
engaged .
As regarded literature , the northern conquerors
of Europe were
then emerging
from the grossest igno-
rance ; and those who had leisure to cultivate its progress ,
were such only as were cloistered in monasteries , the rest
being either
soldiers
or peasants .
And,
unfortunately ,
the first rudiments of science
imbibed were drawn
out of
Aristotle's philosophy , and conveyed
through the medium
of his Arabian commentators ;
whose writings , brought
from the east by the Saracens into Palestine
and Spain ,
were
translated
into
barbarous Latin .
So
that , though
the objects to which
students
naturally
applied
them-
records was altered and turned into
English .
But , at the
restoration ,
this
novelty
was
no longer
coun-
tenanced ; the practitioners
finding
it difficult to express themselves
so
concisely
or
significantly
in
any
other
language
as in Latin .
And
this state of things continued
till
the year
1731, when it was
again
thought
proper
that the proceed-
ings
at law should
be in English,
and it was accordingly
so ordered
by
statute
4
Geo . 2, c. 26.
This
provision
was
made
according
to
the
preamble
of the
statute , that
the
common
people
might
have
knowledge
and
understanding
of
what
was alleged
or done
for
and
against
them
in
the
process
and
pleadings , the judgment
and entries
in a cause.
Technical
phrases , however , and
the names of writs and other process,
were found
to
be so incapable
of
wearing
an English dress with any
degree of
propriety
that in
two
years
time it was
found
necessary
to make a new act, 6 Geo. 2, c. 14,
of which sect. 5 allowed
all tech-
nical words to continue in the usual
language .

selves
in the
infancy
of
a rising
state,
were
of
the
noblest kind ; the establishment of religion , and the regu-
lation of civil polity ; yet having only such tools to work
with, their
execution was trifling and flimsy .
Both the
divinity and the law of those
times were frittered
into
logical
distinctions ,
and
drawn
out
into
metaphysical
subtilties , with
a skill
most
amazingly
artificial
;
yet
which
serves
no
other
purpose , than to show
the
vast
powers of the human
intellect , however vainly or pre-
posterously
employed .
Hence
law in particular , which
(being
intended
for
universal
reception ) ought
to be a
plain
rule
of action , became a science
of the
greatest
intricacy ; especially when blended with the
new refine-
ments engrafted upon feudal
property , which refinements
were from
time
to
time
gradually
introduced
by the
Norman
practitioners , with a view to
supersede
(as they
did in great measure) the more homely , but more intelli-
gible , maxims of distributive
justice among the Saxons .
And, to say the truth, these
scholastic
reformers
trans-
mitted their dialect and finesses to posterity , so interwoven
in the body of our
legal
polity , that they have not yet
been wholly shaken off and cast aside.
People even at the present day are apt to be angry at
the want
of
simplicity
in our
laws ,
though
they
often
mistake variety for confusion and complicated for contra-
dictory decisions .
In a nation
of freemen , a polite
and
commercial
people, the
same paucity
of laws , the same
conciseness
of practice ,
cannot , however ,
reasonably
be
looked for, as might suffice under other circumstances .
Under an arbitrary
despotic government , where lands
are at the
disposal of the prince , the rules of succession
to , or the mode of enjoying them must depend upon his
will
and
pleasure .
Hence
there
can be but few legal
determinations
relating
to the property , the
descent, or
the conveyance of real estates ;
and the
same holds in a
stronger
degree
with regard
to goods and chattels , and
the contracts thereto relating .
Under a tyrannical

trade must be continually in jeopardy , and of consequence
can never be extensive :
this therefore puts an end to the
necessity
of
an
infinite
number
of rules ,
which
the
English merchant
daily recurs to for adjusting
commercial
differences .
Marriages
are then usually contracted with
slaves ; or
at least women
are
treated
as such : no laws
can be therefore
expected to regulate the rights of dower ,
jointures , and
marriage
settlements .
Few also are the
persons who can claim
the
privileges
of any laws ; the
bulk of those inhabiting a country
arbitrarily governed ,
viz .
the
comonalty ,
boors ,
or
peasants
,
being
merely
villeins
and
bondmen .
These are therefore left to the
private
coercion
of their
lords , are
esteemed
incapable
either of enjoying
rights
or of sustaining
injuries , and of
consequence are entitled to no redress .
Thus we may see
under an arbitrary
government , how large a field of legal
contests is rooted up and destroyed.
:
Again
were
we
a poor
and
naked
people,
as the
savages of Western
America , strangers
to science , com-
merce , and the arts as well of convenience as of luxury,
we perhaps should
be content to refer all disputes to the
next man
we might
meet upon
the road , and so put a
short end to every controversy .
For in a state of nature
there is no room for municipal
laws ;
and the nearer any
nation
approaches to that
state , the fewer they will have
occasion for.
When the
people of
Rome
were little
better than sturdy shepherds or herdsmen , all their
laws
are said to have been contained in ten or twelve tables ;
but as luxury , politeness , and dominion increased
, the civil
law increased in the same proportion ; and , though suc-
cessively pruned ,
retrenched , and digested by the Em-
perors Theodosius and Justinian , swelled to an enormous
bulk.
So we may
observe , that , in petty
states
and narrow
territories ,
fewer
laws will
suffice
than in large
ones ,
because
there are fewer objects upon which
the laws can
operate . The regulations of a private family are few , simple ,

and well -known
; those of a prince's household are neces
sarily more various and diffuse .
The main
causes
therefore of the multiplicity
of the
English laws are , the extent of the country
which they
govern ; the commerce
and refinement of
its
inhabitants
;
but
above
all
,
the liberty
and rights
of
property
of
the
subject
.
These will naturally
produce an infinite fund
of
disputes
,
which must
be
judicially terminated
,
and
it
is
essential
to
a
free people
,
that these judicial determina
tions
be published
and
adhered
to
;
in
order that their
property may be
as
certain and fixed
as
the very constitu
tion
of
their state
.
With
us
the judge
is
only
to
declare
and
pronounce
,
not
to
make
or
new
-
model
,
the
law
.
Hence
a
multitude
of
decisions
,
or
cases
adjudged
,
will
arise
;
for seldom will
it
happen that any one rule
or
pre
cedent will exactly suit for many cases
.
And in propor
tion
as
the decisions
of
courts
of
judicature
are multi
plied
,
the law will
be
loaded with
decrees
,
that may
sometimes
(
though
rarely
)
interfere
with
each
other
:
either because
succeeding judges may not
be
apprised
of
the
prior
adjudication
;
or
because
they
may
think
differently
from
their predecessors
;
or
because
the same
arguments
did
not
occur formerly
as
at
present
;
or
,
in
fine
,
because
of
the natural
imbecility
and imperfection
that attends all human
proceedings
.
But wherever this
happens
to
be the case
in
any material
point
,
the legisla
ture
may intervene
to
remove the doubt
,
and
,
upon due
deliberation
had
,
to
determine
by
a
declaratory
statute
how the law shall be held for the future
.
But
is
not
(it
will
be
asked
)
the multitude
of
law
-
suits
an argument
against the clearness and certainty
of
the
law itself
?
Not altogether
so
,
for among
the various
disputes and controversies which are daily
to
be
met with
,
it
is
observable that
comparatively
few arise from
ob
scurity
in
the
rules
or
maxims
of our law
.
But the
dubious
points
,
usually
agitated
in
our
courts
,
arise
chiefly
from the difficulty there
is
in
ascertaining the

intentions of individuals, in their solemn
dispositions of
property ; in their contracts , conveyances
, and testaments .
It is an object
indeed of the utmost
importance
in this
free and commercial
country , to lay as few restraints
as
possible upon the transfer
of possessions
from hand
to
hand, or upon
the designations
marked out for them by
the prudence ,
convenience ,
necessities
,
or
even
by the
caprice, of their owners : yet to determine the intention
of the owner
is frequently
a
matter of
difficulty ,
and
although
our law rarely
hesitates
in
declaring
its own
meaning , the judges
are
frequently
puzzled
to
find
out
the meaning of others, who clothe their intentions
in dark
or new-fangled
expressions .
But , notwithstanding
the vast accession
of legal contro-
versies, arising
from
so fertile
a fund as the ignorance
and wilfulness
of individuals
, these will bear no compa-
rison in point of number with those which are caused by
the dishonesty , and disingenuousness of parties : by either
their
suggesting
complaints
that
are false
in
fact, and
thereupon
bringing groundless
actions ; or by their de-
nying such facts as are true , in setting
up unwarrantable
defences .
And thus much , in passing , as to the alleged
uncertainty of our English law .
4. A fourth innovation
was the introduction
of the trial
by combat , for the decision of civil and criminal
ques-
tions of fact in the last resort .
This was the immemorial
practice of the northern
nations ; but first
reduced
to
regular and stated forms among the Burgundi, about the
close of the
fifth
century : and from them it passed to
other nations , particularly
the Franks and the Normans
:
which
last
had
the honour
to establish it here, though
clearly an unchristian
, as well as most uncertain , method
of trial .
But it was a sufficient
recommendation of it to
the conqueror and his warlike
countrymen , that it was the
usage of their native duchy of Normandy .
5. But the last and most important
alteration , both in
our civil and military polity, was the engrafting
on all

LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
landed estates , a few only
excepted
, the fiction of feudal
tenure ; which
drew after it a numerous
and oppressive
train of servile fruits and appendages
; aids , reliefs , primer
seisins,
wardships ,
marriages ,
escheats ,
and
fines
for
alienation ; the genuine consequences
of the maxim
then
adopted , that all the lands in England were derived from
and holden , mediately or immediately , of the crown .
The nation at this period seems to have groaned
under
as absolute a slavery , as it was in the power of a warlike ,
an ambitious , and
a politic
prince
to
create .
The con
sciences
of men were enslaved by ecclesiastics , devoted to
a foreign
power, and unconnected with the civil
state
under which they lived .
The laws , as well as the prayers ,
were administered
in an unknown
tongue .
The ancient
trial by the country gave way to the decision by battle .
The
forest laws unduly restrained
rural
pleasures
and
manly recreations .
And in cities and towns the case was
no better ; all company being obliged to disperse , and fire
and candle to be extinguished , by
eight
at night , at the
sound of the melancholy
curfew .
The
ultimate
property
in all lands , and a considerable share of their present pro
fits , were vested in the king , or by him granted out to his
Norman
favourites ;
who , by a gradual
progression
of
slavery , were absolute vassals to the crown , and
as abso
lute tyrants to the people.
Unheard -of forfeitures , tal
lages , aids , and fines, were arbitrarily extracted from the
pillaged
landholders , in
pursuance of the new system of
tenure .
And , to crown all , as a consequence
of the tenure
by knight-service , the king had always ready at his com
mand
an army of sixty thousand
knights
who
were
bound , upon pain of having
their
estates
confiscated , to
attend him in time of invasion , or to quell any domestic
'insurrection .
Trade , or foreign
merchandize , was carried
on by the Jews and Lombards , and the very name of an
English
fleet was unknown
to Europe : the nation con
sisting wholly of the clergy , who were also the lawyers ;
the
barons , or
great
lords of the
land ;
the knights,

or soldiery , who
were
the subordinate
landholders
;
and
the burghers , or inferior tradesmen , who from their insig
nificancy
happily retained , in socage and burgage tenures ,
some symbols of their
ancient
freedom .
The rest were.
villeins or bondmen .
From so complete and well -concerted a scheme of ser
vility , it
has
been
the
work of
generations
for
our
ancestors , to redeem themselves
and their posterity into
that
state of liberty which we now
enjoy :
and which
therefore is to be looked upon as resulting
not from
mere
encroachments
on the
crown , and infringements
on the
prerogative , as some
have endeavoured to maintain ; but
from
a gradual
restoration
of that ancient constitution ,
whereof our Saxon forefathers had been unjustly deprived ,
partly by the
policy ,
and
partly by the
force , of the
Norman .
How that restoration
has, in a long
series of
years , been step by step
effected , I will now inquire .
William
Rufus proceeded
on his father's
plan , and in
some points extended it ; particularly
with regard
to the
forest laws .
But his brother
and
successor, Henry I.
found it expedient , when first he came to the crown , to
ingratiate
himself with the people ; by restoring , as our
monkish
historians
tell
us,
or
at
all
events
partially
restoring , the laws of King Edward
the
Confessor .
By
charter he gave up the great grievances of marriage , ward ,
and relief, the beneficial pecuniary fruits of feudal tenures ;
but reserved the tenures themselves , for the same military
purposes
that his
father
introduced
them.
He
also
abolished the curfew ; for, though it is mentioned in our
laws
a full
century afterwards , yet it is rather
spoken of
as a known
time of night (so
denominated
from
that
abrogated usage), than as a still subsisting custom .
There
is extant
charter in
his
name which
contains
some
directions
as to crimes and their punishments , and a few
things
relating
to estates , particularly
as to the descent of
lands .
Land descended
by the Saxon laws equally to all
the
sons , by the
feudal
or
Norman
to the eldest only ,

and king Henry in this particular
moderated
the differ
ence between them ; directing
the eldest son to have only
the principal
estate , " primum patris feudum ," the rest of
his
estates , if he had any others , being equally divided
among them all.
On the other hand , he gave up to the
clergy
the
free election of bishops
and
mitred
abbots :
reserving
however
these
ensigns
of
patronage ,
congé
d'élire, custody
of the
temporalities
when vacant ,
and
homage
upon their restitution .
He lastly united
again
for a time the civil and ecclesiastical
courts , which union
was soon dissolved by his Norman
clergy : and , upon that
final
dissolution , the
cognizance of testamentary
causes
seems to have been first
given
to the ecclesiastical
court .
The rest remained as in his father's time .
The
usurper
Stephen ,
as the
manner
of usurpers
is,
promised much at his accession
, especially with regard
to
redressing the grievances of the forest laws , but performed
no great matter
either in that or in any other point.
It
is to his reign , however , that we owe the introduction
and
systematic teaching
of the
Roman
civil and canon laws
within this realm ;
and
at the
same
time was imported
into it the doctrine of appeals to the court of Rome , as a
branch of the canon law.
By the time of king Henry II. , if not
earlier , the
charter of Henry I. seems
to have been in part forgotten :
for we find the claim of marriage , ward , and relief, then
flourishing
in full vigour .
The right of primogeniture
seems also to have tacitly revived , being found more
con
venient for the public than the parcelling
of estates
into
a multitude
of minute
subdivisions .
However , in this
prince's reign much was done to methodize the laws , and
reduce them into a regular order.
Throughout
this reign.
also was continued the important
struggle , which we have
had
occasion
before
to
mention ,
between
the
laws of
England and Rome : the former supported by the strength
of the temporal
nobility , the latter
by the popish
clergy .
Which dispute was kept on foot till the reign of Edward I. :


FROM THE
NORMAN
CONQUEST
TO EDWARD
I.
515
when the laws of England , under the new discipline intro
duced by that
skilful
commander ,
obtained
a complete
and permanent victory .
In connection with the reign of
Henry II. four things peculiarly
merit
the attention of a
legal antiquarian
:
1. The constitutions
of the parliament
at Clarendon , A. D. 1164 , whereby the king
checked the
power of the
pope
and his clergy , and greatly narrowed
the total exemption
they claimed from
the
secular juris
diction :
though
his
further
progress
was
unhappily
stopped , by the fatal event of the disputes
between him
self and Archbishop
Becket .
2.
The
institution
of the
office of justices
in eyre, in itinere ;
the king
having
divided the kingdom
into circuits , and commissioned these
new created
judges
to administer justice , and try writs of
assize in the several counties .
These remedies are said to
have been then
first
invented ;
before which
all
causes
were usually determined
in the
county courts , according
to the Saxon custom ; or before the king's justiciaries
in
the aula regis, in pursuance of the
Norman
regulations .
The latter
of
these
tribunals
travelled
about with the
king's
person ,
and
thus
were
occasioned
intolerable
expense and delay to suitors ; the former , however proper
for the hearing of unimportant
cases , when even
injustice
may be sometimes better than procrastination , had become
too
much
open
to the
charge of ignorance of law , and
partiality as to facts , to determine matters of considerable
moment .
3. The
introduction
and establishment of the
grand assize, or trial by a special kind of jury in a writ of
right , at the option of the tenant or defendant , instead of
the
barbarous
and Norman
trial by battle .
4. To this
period
must
also be referred the introduction
of escuage ,
or pecuniary commutation
for personal military service
;
which
in
process
of time was the parent of the subsidies
granted to the crown by parliament , and of the land tax of
later times .
Richard I. , a brave
and
magnanimous
prince , was a
sportsman as well
as
a soldier ;
and therefore
enforced

.
the forest laws with some rigour ; which occasioned dis
contents among his people : though (according to Matthew
Paris) he
repealed
certain
corporal
penalties
before in
flicted
on
such
as
transgressed
in
hunting
;
probably
finding
that their
severity
prevented
prosecutions .
He
also , when abroad , composed a body of naval laws at the
isle
of
Oleron :
which
are still
extant ,
and of high
authority
for in his time we began again to discover ,
that (as an island ) we
were
naturally
a maritime
power .
But , with
regard
to civil proceedings , we find
nothing
very
remarkable
in this reign , except a few regulations
regarding
the Jews , and the justices
in eyre :
the king's
thoughts being chiefly taken up by the knight errantry of
a crusade against the Saracens in the Holy Land.
In king John's time , and that of his
son Henry III. ,
the rigours of the feudal tenures and the forest laws were
so warmly
kept
up , that
they occasioned many insurrec
tions of the
barons
or
principal
feudatories :
which
at
last
had this
effect , that first king John , and afterwards
his son , consented to the two famous
charters of English
liberties ,
Magna
Carta and Carta
de Foresta .
Of these
the latter was well calculated
to redress many grievances ,
and encroachments of the crown , in the exercise
of forest
law
and the
former
confirmed
many
liberties
of
the
church , and redressed
many grievances incident
to feudal
tenures , of no small
moment
at the time ; though
now,
unless
attentively
considered ,
they
may
seem but of
trifling
concern .
Besides these
feudal
provisions ,
care
was also taken therein to protect the subject against other
oppressions , then
frequently
arising
from
unreasonable
amercements , from illegal
distresses , or other process for
debts or services
due to the crown , and from the tyrannical
abuse of the prerogative of purveyance and pre-emption .
Magna
Carta
fixed
the
forfeiture
of lands
for felony ;
prohibited
future
grants
of
exclusive
fisheries ;
and
restrained
the erection of new bridges
so as to oppress
the neighbourhood .
With
respect
to private rights : it


FROM
THE NORMAN
CONQUEST
TO
EDWARD
I.
517
established
the
testamentary
power
of the
subject over
part of his
personal
estate , the
rest being
distributed
among his wife and children
; and it laid down the law of
dower . In matters of public
police and national
concern
:
it enjoined an uniformity
of weights and measures
; gave
new encouragements
to
commerce
, by the
protection
of
merchant strangers ;
and forbad
the alienation of lands
in
mortmain .
With
regard
to
the
administration
of
justice
besides
prohibiting
all
denials or delays of it ,
Magna
Carta fixed the
court of common pleas at West
minster , that
the
suitors
might
no longer
be
harassed
with following
the king's person in his
progresses
; and
at the same time brought
the trial of issues home to the
very doors of the
freeholders , by directing
assizes
to be
taken in the proper
counties ,
and
establishing
annual
circuits ; it also
corrected
some
abuses
then
incident
to
the trials by wager of law and of battle , directed
the
regular
awarding of inquests for life
or member ; prohi
bited the king's inferior
ministers
from
holding
pleas of
the crown , or trying
any criminal
charge , whereby many
forfeitures
might
otherwise
have
unjustly
accrued
to
the exchequer
and
regulated
the
time
and
place of
holding
the inferior
tribunals
of justice , the county court ,
sheriff's
tourn , and court -leet.
It confirmed and estab
lished
the liberties
of the city of London , and all other
cities , boroughs , towns , and ports of the kingdom .
And ,
lastly (which
alone would
have merited
the title that it
bears , of the great charter ) , it protected every individual
of the nation in the free enjoyment of his life , his liberty ,
and his
property , unless declared to be forfeited by the
judgment
of his peers , or the law of the land .
However , by means of these
struggles , the pope in the
reign of king John gained a still greater ascendant here,
than he ever had before enjoyed ; which continued through
the long reign of his son Henry III.: in the beginning of
which the old Saxon trial by ordeal was totally abolished .
And we may by this
time
perceive, from an inspection of

THE

AND

LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
Bracton's
treatise ,
a still
further
improvement
in
the
method
and regularity
of
the
common
law,
especially
in regard to pleadings .
Nor must it be forgotten , that
the first traces
which remain
of the
separation of the
greater barons from the less , in the constitution of parlia-
ments , are found in the great charter of king John ; though
omitted in that of Henry III. : and that , towards the end
of the latter of these reigns , we find the first record of a
writ for summoning
knights , citizens , and
burgesses
to
parliament .
And here we conclude the second period of
our English legal history .
III. The third commences with the reign of Edward
I. ,
who has justly been
styled
our English Justinian .
For
in his time the law received
so sudden
a perfection , that
sir Matthew
Hale
does not scruple
to
affirm , that
more
was done in the first thirteen
years of his reign
to settle
and establish the distributive
justice of the kingdom , than
had subsequently been effected
up to his own time .
It would
be endless
to enumerate the
particulars
of
these regulations
; but the principal
may be reduced
under
the following
general
heads .
1. He
established , con-
firmed , and
settled , the great
charter
and
charter
of
forests .
2.
He gave a mortal
wound to the
encroach-
ments of the pope and his clergy , by limiting and estab-
lishing the bounds of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
: and by
obliging the ordinary , to whom all the goods of intestates at
that time belonged , to discharge the debts of the deceased .
3. He defined the limits of the several temporal courts of
the highest jurisdiction
, those of the king's bench , common
pleas, and exchequer ;
so as they might not interfere with
each other's proper business .
4. He settled the bounda-
ries
of the inferior courts
in
counties , hundreds ,
and
manors
confining
them to causes of no great
amount ,
according to their
primitive
institution
.
5.
He
secured
the property
of the subject , by
abolishing
all arbitrary
taxes and tallages , levied without consent of the national


FROM
EDWARD
I.
TO THE
REFORMATION
.
519
council .
6. He guarded the common justice of the king-
dom from abuses , by giving up the
royal
prerogative
of
sending mandates
to interfere
in private
causes .
7. He
settled the form , solemnities , and effect, of fines levied in
the court of common pleas ; though
the thing itself was
of Saxon origin .
8. He first established
a repository for
the public
records of the
kingdom
;
few of which
are
more ancient than the reign of his father , and those were
by him collected .
9. He improved upon the Saxon laws ,
by the
method
of watch
and
ward , for
preserving
the
public peace and preventing
robberies , established by the
statute of Winchester
.
10. He settled and reformed many
abuses incident to tenures , and removed
some
restraints
on the
alienation
of landed
property , by the
statute of
quia emptores.
11. He instituted
a speedier way for the
recovery of debts , by granting
execution , not only upon
goods and chattels , but also upon lands , by writ of elegit ;
which was of signal benefit to a trading people : and upon
the same commercial
ideas , he also allowed the charging
of lands in a statute merchant , to pay debts contracted in
trade , contrary to all feudal principles .
12. He effectually
provided for the recovery of advowsons , as temporal rights ;
in which , before, the law had
been
extremely deficient .
13.
He also effectually closed the great
gulph , in which
all the landed property
of the kingdom
was in danger of
being swallowed up by his reiterated statutes of mortmain ,
most admirably
adapted to meet the frauds that had then
been devised, though afterwards contrived to be evaded by
the invention
of uses .
14. He established
a new limi-
tation of property by the creation of estates
tail .
15. He
reduced all Wales to the
subjection ,
not
only
of the
crown ,
but in great measure of the laws , of England,
(which was thoroughly
completed in the reign of Henry
VIII . ;) and seems
to have entertained a design of doing
the like by Scotland , so as to have formed an entire and
complete union of the island of Great Britain .

catalogue much
further-but ,

.
upon the whole , we may conclude that the
scheme and
model for the administration
of justice
between party and
party , were mainly
settled by this
king : and
continued
nearly the same
for several centuries ; abating
some few
alterations , which
the humour or necessity of subsequent
times
occasioned
.
The
forms of writs , by which
actions
were
commenced , were made more
perfect in his
reign .
The
pleadings , consequent
upon
the writs, were
then
short , nervous , and perspicuous ; not intricate , verbose, and
formal .
The legal
treatises , written
in his time , as those
of Britton , Fleta , Hengham , and others , continued to be ,
for the most part , of acknowledged authority , till the alte
ration of tenures took place.
And , to conclude , it is from
this period ,
from
the
date of the
exact observance of
Magna Carta , rather
than
from
that of
its
making
or
renewal
in
the
days
of
king John and Henry III
.,
that
the liberty
of
Englishmen
began again
to
rear its head
:
though the weight
of
the
military tenures hung heavy
upon
it
for some
ages after
.
From
the time of Edward
I.
to
that of Henry VIII
.
there happened very few
,
and those not very considerable
,
alterations
in
the
legal forms
of
proceedings
.
As
to
matter
of
substance
:
the old
Gothic
powers
of
electing
the principal
subordinate
magistrates
,
the sheriffs
,
and
conservators
of
the
peace
,
were taken
from
the
people
in
the reigns
of
Edward
II
.
and Edward III
.;
and jus
tices
of
the
peace
were established
instead
of
the latter
.
In the reign
also
of
Edward III
.
the parliament
is
sup
posed
to
have approached
its
present form
,
by
a
separa
tion
of the commons
from
the
lords
.
The
statute for
defining and ascertaining treasons was one
of
the first pro
ductions of this new
-
modelled
assembly
;
and the trans
lation
of
the law proceedings from French into Latin was
another
.
Much also was done
,
under the auspices
of
this
magnanimous
prince
,
for establishing
our domestic manu
factures
;
by prohibiting the exportation
of
English wool
,
and the importation
or
wear
of
foreign cloth
or
furs

by
encouraging
clothworkers
from
other
countries
to
settle here .
Nor was the legislature
inattentive
to many
other
branches of commerce, or indeed to
commerce in
general
for , in particular , it enlarged the credit of the
merchant , by introducing
the statute -staple ; whereby he
might the more readily pledge
his lands for the security
of his mercantile
debts .
And , as personal property then
grew , by the extension of trade, to be much
more con-
siderable than
formerly , care was taken , in case of intes-
tacies, to appoint
administrators
particularly
nominated
by the law, to distribute
that personal property
among
the creditors
and kindred of the
deceased , which
before
had
been usually applied , by the officers
of the ordinary ,
to uses
then
denominated
pious .
The
statutes also of
præmunire , for
effectually
depressing the civil
power of
the pope , were the work of this and of the ensuing reign .
And the establishment of a laborious parochial clergy , by
the endowment of vicarages out of the overgrown posses-
sions of the monasteries , added
lustre to the close of the
fourteenth
century :
though
the
seeds of the
general
reformation , which were thereby first sown in the king-
dom , were almost overwhelmed by the spirit of persecution
introduced
into the laws of the land by the influence of
the regular clergy .
From this time
to that of Henry VII. , the civil
wars
and disputed titles to the crown gave no leisure for further
juridical improvements
; " nam silent leges inter arma. ” —
And yet it is to these very disputes that we owe the happy
loss of the French dominions of the
crown
on the conti-
nent ; an event which turned the minds of our subsequent
princes
entirely to domestic concerns.
To these
likewise
was due the method of barring
entails by the fiction of
common recoveries ; invented
originally
by the clergy , to
evade
the
statutes of mortmain , but
introduced
under
Edward IV. , for the purpose of unfettering
estates , and
making
them
more liable
to forfeiture
:

on
the
other hand , their owners endeavoured to protect them by

the universal establishment of uses , another of the clerical
inventions .
In the reign of king Henry VII. , his ministers
(not to
say the king himself) were more industrious
in hunting
out prosecutions
upon
old and forgotten
penal
laws , in
order to extort
money from the
subject , than in framing
any new beneficial
regulations .
For the distinguishing
character of this reign was that of amassing
treasure in
the king's
coffers , by every means that could be devised :
and almost every alteration in the laws , however salutary
or otherwise in its future
consequences
,
had
this
and
this
only for its
special and immediate object.
To this
end the court of
star-chamber
was new-modelled ,
and
armed with powers , most dangerous and unconstitutional
,
over the person and property of the subject .
Informa
tions were allowed
to be received , in lieu of indictments ,
at the assizes
and
sessions
of the
peace , in order to mul
tiply fines and pecuniary penalties .
The statute of fines
for landed property was craftily and covertly contrived , to
facilitate
the destruction of entails , and make the owners
of real estates
more liable to
forfeit
as well
as
more
capable of alienating
them .
The benefit of clergy (which
so often intervened to stop attainders and save the inheri
tance) was now
allowed but
once
to lay offenders , who
only could
have inheritances
to lose.
A writ of capias
was permitted in all actions on the case , and the defendant
might in
consequence
be outlawed ; because
upon
such
outlawry his goods became
the property of the crown .
In
short , there is hardly
a statute in this reign , introductive
of a new law or modifying
the old , but what either directly
or obliquely tended to the emolument of the exchequer.

tions with this
island
cut off, the crown restored to its
supremacy
over spiritual
men and causes , and the patron-
age of bishoprics being once
more indisputably
vested in
the crown .
And had the spiritual
courts
been
at this
time reunited to the civil , we
should
have
seen the
old
Saxon
constitution
with regard
to
ecclesiastical
polity
completely
restored .
With regard also to our civil polity, the statute of wills ,
and the statute of uses , (both passed in the reign of this
prince ,)
made
a great
alteration
as
to property :
the
former, by allowing
the
devise of real
estates
by will ,
which
before
was in general
forbidden
;
the
latter , by
endeavouring
to
destroy the
intricate
nicety of uses ,
though the
narrowness
and
pedantry
of the courts of
common
law prevented this
statute from having its full
beneficial
effect.
And thence
the
courts of equity
as-
sumed
a jurisdiction
, dictated
by common
justice
and
common
sense
: which ,
however arbitrarily exercised or
productive of jealousies in
its
infancy
,
has
at
length been
matured into an admirable system
of
jurisprudence
.
From
the
statute
of
uses
,
and another
statute of the
same
antiquity
(
which
protected
estates
for
years from
being
destroyed by the
reversioner
),
a
remarkable
alteration
took
place
in
the mode of conveyancing
:
the
ancient
assurance by feoffment
and livery upon the land
being
very seldom
practised
,
after the
more
easy and
more
private invention
of
transferring
property
,
by secret
con-
veyances
to
uses
;
and long terms
of
years being continu-
ally created
in
mortgages and family settlements
,
which
might
be
moulded
to
a
thousand
useful
purposes by the
ingenuity of an able artist

of the
fraudulent ,
as for the relief of the unfortunate ,
trader ; all these were
capital
alterations
of
our
legal
polity , and highly agreeable to that character , which the
English
began
now to reassume , of a great commercial
people.

of Wales with England , and
the more uniform

of
many grievances
and oppressions which
had been intro
duced by his father , will ever make the administration of
Henry VIII.
a very distinguished
æra in the annals
of
our juridical history .
It must however be remarked , that (particularly
in his
later years) the
royal
prerogative
was
strained by this
sovereign to a very tyrannical
and oppressive height ; and ,
what was the worst
circumstance , its encroachments were
established by law, under the sanction of those pusillani
mous
parliaments ,
one of which , to its eternal disgrace ,
passed
a statute , whereby it was enacted
that the king's
proclamations
should have the force of acts of parliament
;
and others concurred in the creation of that amazing heap
of wild
and
new-fangled
treasons , which
were slightly
touched
upon in a former chapter (a) .
Happily for the
nation , this arbitrary
reign was succeeded
by the minority
of an amiable prince ; during the short sunshine of which ,
great part of these extravagant laws were repealed .
And ,
to do justice
to the
shorter
reign of queen Mary, many
salutary
and popular
laws , in civil matters , were
made
under her administration
; perhaps the better to reconcile
the people to the bloody measures
which she was induced
to pursue , for the re-establishment of religious
slavery :
the well
concerted
schemes
for
effecting
which ,

(through the providence of God ) defeated
by the season-
able accession of queen Elizabeth.
The
religious
liberties of the
nation
being , by that
happy
event established (though in their infancy guarded ,
against
papists
and other
non -conformists , by coercive
and sanguinary
laws) ; the forest
laws having
fallen into
disuse ;
and the
administration
of
civil
rights
in the
courts
of justice
being
carried
on in
a regular
course ,
according
to the wise
institutions
of king Edward
I. ,
without
any
material
innovations
;
all
the
principal
grievances
introduced
by the
Norman
conquest
seem to
have been gradually
shaken off, and our Saxon constitution
restored , with considerable improvements :
except only in
the continuation
of the military tenures , and a few other
points , which still armed the crown with a very oppressive
and dangerous prerogative . It is also to be remarked , that
the spirit of enriching
the clergy and endowing religious
houses had (through the former abuse of it) gone over to
such a contrary extreme, and the princes of the house of
Tudor and their favourites
had fallen
with such avidity
upon the spoils of the
church , that a decent and honour-
able
maintenance
was wanting
to many of the bishops
and clergy .
This
produced the restraining
statutes , to
prevent the alienations
of lands
and tithes belonging to
the
church
and universities .
The number
of indigent
persons having
also greatly increased , by withdrawing
the
alms
of the monasteries ,
a plan was formed in the reign
of
queen Elizabeth
, more
humane
and beneficial than
any which had
been
previously
adopted,
for setting
to
work the able-bodied poor , and affording relief to such as
through age or infirmity
were unable to work .
Considering , however , the reign of queen
Elizabeth
in
its political
aspect , we
can have no reason to regret many
subsequent alterations in the English constitution .
For,
though
in general she was
a wise and excellent princess ,
and loved her people ; though in her time trade flourished ,
riches
increased , the laws
were duly administered ,
the

nation
was
respected
abroad , and the people were happy
at home ;
yet
the increase of the power of the star
chamber , and the erection of the high commission
court
in matters ecclesiastical , were the work of her reign .
She
also kept
her parliaments
at a very awful distance :
and
in many particulars
she , at times , would carry the prero
gative as high as her most arbitrary
predecessors.
It is
true , she seldom exerted
this prerogative , so as to oppress
individuals
, but still
she had it to exert : and therefore
the felicity of her
reign
depended
more on her want of
opportunity
and
inclination , than want of power
to play
the tyrant . This is a high encomium on her merit ; but at
the same time it is sufficient to show , that these were not
indeed
the golden
days of genuine liberty
as some have
taught :
for , surely , the liberty of the subject should be
dependent not so much on the gracious
behaviour , as on
the limited power , of the sovereign .
The great
revolution
which had happened , in manners
and in property , had imperceptibly
paved the way , for as
great a revolution
in government : yet , while that revolu
tion was in progress , the crown
became
for the time more
arbitrary than ever , through those very means which after
wards reduced its influence .
Till the close of the Lancas
trian civil wars , the property and the power of the nation
were
chiefly
divided
between the
crown , the nobility ,
and the clergy .
The
commons were generally in a state
of great ignorance ;
their personal wealth , before the ex
tension of trade was comparatively
small ; and the nature
of their landed
property was such , as kept them in con
tinual dependence
; the feudal lord of each such commoner
being
usually
some
powerful
baron , some opulent abbey ,
or sometimes the king himself.
Though
a notion
of
general
liberty
had
strongly
pervaded and animated the
whole constitution , yet the particular
liberty, the natural
equality , and personal independence of individuals
, were
little
regarded
or thought of ; nay, even to assert them
was treated as the height of sedition and rebellion .
Our

ancestors
heard , with detestation and horror , those senti
ments
rudely
delivered ,
and
pushed
to
most
absurd
extremes , by the violence of a Cade and a Tyler ;
which
have
since
been
applauded , with a
zeal
almost
rising
to
idolatry , when
softened
and
recommended
by the
eloquence ,
the
moderation ,
and
the
arguments
of
a
Sidney , a Locke , and a Milton .
But
when
learning , by the
invention
of printing and
the progress of religious
reformation , began
to be uni
versally
disseminated
;
when
trade and navigation were
suddenly
carried
to an amazing extent , by the use of the
compass and the consequent discovery of the Indies ; the
minds of people, thus enlightened by science
and enlarged
by observation and travel , began to entertain a more just
opinion of the dignity and rights of man.
An inundation
of wealth
flowed
in upon the merchants ,
and
middle
ranks ; while the two great estates of the kingdom , which
formerly
had
balanced
the
prerogative , the nobility and
the clergy , were greatly impoverished and weakened. The
popish
clergy , detected in their frauds
and
abuses , ex
posed to the resentment of the populace , and stripped of
their
lands
and revenues , stood
trembling
for their very
existence .
The
nobles , enervated
by the refinements of
luxury (which knowledge , foreign travel , and the progress
of the politer
arts , are too apt to introduce with them
selves ) , and fired with disdain
at being
rivalled in mag
nificence
by the
opulent
citizens ,
fell
into
enormous
expenses
;
to gratify
which they were permitted , by the
policy
of the times , to dissipate their overgrown estates ,
and alienate their ancient patrimonies .
This gradually re
duced their power and their influence within very moderate
bounds
while the king , by the spoil of the monasteries ,
and the
great
increase of the
customs , grew rich , in
dependent , and haughty ;
and the commons were not yet
sensible of the strength they had acquired , nor urged to
examine
its
extent
by
new
burthens
or
oppressive
taxations , during the sudden opulence of the
exchequer .


528
THE
RISE
AND
PROGRESS
OF THE LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
Intent upon
acquiring
new riches , and
happy
in being
freed from the
insolence and tyranny of the orders more
immediately
above
them , they
never dreamt of opposing
the
prerogative
to
which
they
had
been
so little
ac-
customed ; much less of taking
the lead in opposition , to
which by their weight
and their
property
they were now
entitled .
The latter years of Henry VIII . were therefore
the times of the greatest despotism that have been known
in this
island
since the
death of William the Norman :
the prerogative
as it then stood by common law
(and
much
more when
extended by act of parliament ) , being
too large to be endured in a land of liberty .
Queen
Elizabeth , and the intermediate
princes of the
Tudor line , had almost the same legal powers , and some-
times
exerted
them
as
roughly ,
as their
father
king
Henry VIII .
But the critical
situation
of that princess
with regard
to her legitimacy , her religion , her enmity
with
Spain ,
and
her
jealousy
of the queen of Scots ,
occasioned greater caution in her conduct .
She probably ,
or her
able advisers , had penetration
enough to discern
how the
power
of the
kingdom
had gradually
shifted
its
channel ,
and
wisdom
enough
not to
provoke
the
commons to discover and feel their strength .
She there-
fore threw a veil over the
odious part of prerogative ;
which
was never wantonly
thrown
aside,
but
only
to
answer
some important
purpose : and , though
the royal
treasury
no longer
overflowed with the
wealth
of the
clergy , which
had
been
all granted
out ,
and
had
con-
tributed to enrich the people, she asked for supplies with
such
moderation ,
and
managed
them
with
so
much
economy , that
the commons were happy in obliging
her.
Such , in short , were her
circumstances , her
necessities ,
her wisdom , and her
good disposition , that
never did a
prince
so long
and so entirely , for the space of nearly
half a century , reign in the affections of the people.
On the accession of king James I. , no new degree of
royal power was added
to , or exercised , by him ; but such


FROM
THE REFORMATION

529
a sceptre was too weighty to be wielded
by such a hand .
The unreasonable
and imprudent
exertion
of what
was
then deemed
to be prerogative , upon trivial and unworthy
occasions , and the claim of a more absolute power inherent
in the kingly office than had ever been carried
into prac
tice , soon awakened the sleeping lion .
The people heard
with astonishment
doctrines preached from the throne and
the pulpit , subversive of liberty and property , and all the
natural
rights
of humanity .
They
examined
into the
divinity of this claim , and found it weakly and fallaciously
supported
and common reason assured them , that if it
were of human
origin , no
constitution
could
establish it
without power of revocation , no precedent could sanctify ,
no length of time could confirm it.
The leaders
felt the
pulse of the nation , and found they had ability as well as
inclination to resist it : and accordingly resisted and op
posed it, whenever the pusillanimous
temper of the reign
ing monarch had courage to put it to the trial ; and they
gained
some
little victories
in the cases of impositions ,
monopolies , and the dispensing power . In the mean time ,
very little was done for the improvement of private justice ,
except the abolition of sanctuaries , and the extension of
the bankrupt
laws , the limitation of suits
and
actions ,
and the regulating
of informations
upon penal
statutes .
For we cannot
class the laws against witchcraft
and con
juration
under the
head of improvements
; nor
did the
dispute
between
lord
Ellesmere
and sir Edward
Coke ,
concerning
the
powers
of the
court of chancery ,
tend
directly to the advancement of justice .
Indeed when Charles I. succeeded
to the crown of his
father , and attempted
to revive
some
enormities , which
had been dormant in the reign of king James, the loans
and benevolences
extorted from the subject, the arbitrary
imprisonments
for refusal , the exertion of martial
law in
time of peace , and other domestic grievances , clouded the
morning of that misguided prince's reign ; which , though
the noon of it began a little to brighten , at last
went

down in blood , and left the kingdom
in confusion .
It
must
be acknowledged
that ,
by the
petition
of right ,
enacted
to abolish these encroachments , the English con-
stitution
received
great
alteration
and
improvement .
But there still remained
the latent
power of the forest-
laws , which
the crown most unseasonably revived .
The
legal jurisdiction of the
star-chamber and of the high
commission
courts
was
also
extremely
great ;
though
their usurped authority
was still greater .
And if we add
to these abuses
the disuse of parliaments , the
ill
-
timed
zeal and
despotic
proceedings
of
the
ecclesiastical
go-
vernors
in
matters
of
mere indifference
,
together with the
arbitrary
levies
of
tonnage
and
poundage
,
ship
-
money
,
and other projects
,
we may see grounds most amply suffi-
cient for seeking
redress
in
a
legal
constitutional
way
.
This redress
,
when sought
,
was also constitutionally
given
:
for all these oppressions
were
actually
abolished by the
king
in
parliament
,
before the rebellion broke out
,
by the
several statutes for triennial
parliaments
,
for abolishing
the star
-
chamber and high commission
courts
,
for ascer-
taining the extent
of
forests and forest
-
laws
,
for renounc-
ing ship
-
money and other exactions
,
and for giving up
the prerogative
of
knighting the king's tenants
in
capite
in
consequence
of
their feudal tenures
;
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
that these concessions
were not made with
so
good
a
grace
,
as
to
conciliate
the confidence
of
the
people
.
Unfortunately
,
either by his
own
mismanage-
ment
,
or
by the arts
of
his enemies
,
the king had lost the
reputation
of
sincerity
;
which
is
the greatest unhappiness
that can befal
a
prince
.
Though he formerly had strained
his prerogative
,
not only beyond what the genius
of
the
times would bear
,
but also beyond the examples
of
former
ages
,
he had now consented
to
reduce
it
to
a
lower ebb
than was thought
by many
to
be
consistent
with mo-
narchical
government
.
A
conduct
so
opposite
to
his
temper and principles
,
joined with
some rash actions and
unguarded
expressions
,
made the people suspect that this

531
condescension
was
merely
feigned .
Flushed therefore
with the
success they had gained , fired with resentment
for past oppressions , and dreading the consequences
if the
king should
regain
his
power , the popular
leaders grew
altogether
ungovernable , and joining with a set of mili-
tary enthusiasts , they at length overturned the church and
monarchy ,
and
proceeded
to the trial and
execution of
their sovereign .
I pass by the crude and abortive schemes
for amending
the laws in the times of confusion
which
followed ; the
most promising
and sensible whereof ( such as the estab-
lishment of new
trials , the abolition
of feudal
tenures ,
the act of navigation , and
some
others) were adopted in
the-
V. Fifth
period ,
which I am next to mention ,
viz . ,
after the restoration of king Charles II. , whereupon mili-
tary tenures (which constituted the then principal
remain-
ing grievance ) were immediately
swept away by statute ,
except
as regarded corruption
of inheritable
blood , upon
attainder for treason or felony .
And though the monarch ,
in whose person the royal
government
was restored , and
with it our ancient
constitution , deserves
no commenda-
tion from
posterity , yet in his reign
(wicked , sanguinary ,
and
turbulent
as it was) , the
concurrence of happy cir-
cumstances was such, that from
thence we may date not.
only the re-establishment
of our
church
and monarchy ,
but also the regeneration of English liberty .
For therein
not
only
the
slavish
tenures , with all their oppressive
appendages
, were removed, and
ceased
to encumber the
estates
of the subject ; but also an additional
security of
his person from imprisonment
was obtained by that great
bulwark of our constitution , the habeas corpus act .
These
two
statutes , with regard to our
property
and
persons
,
form
a second magna carta , as beneficial and effectual as
that of Runing-Mead .
That only pruned the luxuriances
of the feudal system ; but the statute of Charles II. for

abolishing military tenures extirpated
its
worst slaveries
.
Magna Carta only
,
in
general
terms
,
declared
,
that
no
man
shall
be
imprisoned
contrary
to
law
:
the
habeas
corpus act points out effectual means
,
as
well for releasing
himself
,
though committed even by the king
in
council
,
as
for punishing
those
who
may
thus
unconstitutionally
misuse him
.
To these benefits derived under Charles
II
.,I
may add
the abolition
of
the prerogatives
of
purveyance and pre-
emption
;
the statute
for holding
triennial
parliaments
;
the
abolition
of the writ
de
hæretico
comburendo
;
the
statute
of
frauds
and
perjuries
,
which
gave
a
great and
necessary security
to
private
property
;
the statute for
distribution
of
intestates
'
estates
,
and that
of
amendments
and jeofails
,
which cut off many superfluous niceties which
had long disgraced
our law
:
and what
has been here
said
,
when we likewise consider the freedom from excessive
taxes and standing armies which the subject then enjoyed
,
will be sufficient
to
demonstrate
this truth
,
that the con-
stitution
of
England had arrived
at
fuller vigour
,
and the
balance between liberty and prerogative was more true
in
the reign
of
king Charles
II
.
than
it
had ever previously
been
.
It
is
far from my intention
to
palliate
or
defend many
very iniquitous
proceedings
,
contrary
to
all law
,
which
occurred during
that reign
,
through the artifice
of
wicked
politicians
,
both
in
and out
of
office
.
What

hands, to assert
and preserve that
liberty , if invaded by
the royal
prerogative .
For which I need
but appeal to
the memorable catastrophe of the next reign .
For when
king Charles's
deluded brother
attempted
to enslave the
nation , he found it was beyond his power :
the
people
both could , and did , resist him
; and, in
consequence
of
such resistance , obliged him to quit his enterprise and his
throne together .
Thus
far, for
the
amusement
and instruction
of the
student, have been delineated the outlines of the history
of our laws and liberties : from their first rise and gradual
progress , among
our British
and
Saxon
ancestors , till
their total
eclipse at the Norman
conquest ; from which
they gradually
emerged , and at length
rose to the degree
of perfection
indicated .
We have seen , in the course of
our
inquiries , in this
and the former Volumes , in what
manner the fundamental maxims and rules of law , which
regard the rights of persons, and the rights of things , the
private injuries that may be offered
to both , and the crimes
which
affect the public , did , up to the latter part of the
seventeenth century , gradually
settle down into a system
:
that the forms of administering
justice
were much im-
proved under Edward I.: that our religion was established
at the reformation
; but that the recovery of our civil and
political
liberties
was a work of longer
time ;
a work
which
greatly
advanced
after
the
restoration
of king
Charles , was more nearly perfected at the era of the happy
revolution , and since that
epoch has received many and
important
touches .
And now we pass on to another portion of our legal
history ; viz.-
VI. From the revolution in 1688 to the passing of the
Reform
Act ,
A.D.
1832.
This
portion
of our
history
may conveniently
be subdivided into two parts , the earlier
of which
reaches
to and includes the date of the
union
with
Ireland , an event which
consolidated
the physical

OF THE

OF
ENGLAND .
strength
of
our
United
Kingdom ,
and
the
latter
of
which
closes with an act of political
justice ;
an act not
indeed final, but
imparting
fresh vigour
to our
consti-
tution .
During the earlier of these two periods
many laws of
primary importance were promulgated
; the bill of rights ,
the
toleration
act, the
act of settlement , the
acts
for
uniting England with
Scotland
and with Ireland, and
other
acts
which , taken together , asserted our liberties
in clear and emphatic terms ; regulated
the
succession
of
the crown by parliament
; confirmed and exemplified
the
doctrine that resistance by the people is justifiable
should
the executive magistrate endeavour to subvert the consti-
tution ; maintained the superiority of the laws above the
king , by pronouncing
his dispensing
power to be illegal
;
indulged
tender
consciences
with an increase of religious
liberty ; established triennial , since turned into septennial ,
elections of members to serve in parliament
; excluded
certain
officers from the house of commons ; efficiently
secured
the independence and supported the dignity of the
speaker of that house ; restrained
the king's pardon from
obstructing
parliamentary
impeachments ;
imparted
to
all the lords an equal right of trying their fellow - peers
;
regulated
and
simplified
trials
for high treason ;
and
declared the functions of the jury in trials
for libel ;
set
bounds to the civil list ; placed the administration
of that
revenue in hands that are accountable to parliament
; and
made the judges
independent
of the
crown .
Though
these provisions
did , in appearance and nominally , reduce
the strength of the executive power to a much lower ebb
than in the immediately preceding period ; if we throw into
the
opposite
scale the
acquisition of force arising
from
the Riot Act , and the existence sanctioned by parliament
of a standing
army ; if we also take into account the vast
increase of persons interested in the maintenance of the
status
quo as
creditors
of the
public , by reason of the
enormous
additions
to our
debt , we shall perhaps
find


FROM THE

535
that the crown
gradually
and imperceptibly
gained , in
this
sixth
epoch ,
almost
as
much in
influence
as it
apparently lost in prerogative .
The chief
alterations of moment in the administration
of private justice during this
period , are the solemn re-
cognition of the law of nations with respect to the rights
of ambassadors : the
cutting
off
excrescences
, that in
process of time had sprung
out of the practical
part of
our law
the protection
of corporate rights by the im-
provements
in writs of mandamus, and
informations
in
nature of quo warranto : the regulation of trial by jury,
and the admitting
witnesses for prisoners upon oath
the
further restraints
upon alienation of lands in mortmain
;
the annihilation of the terrible judgments
of peine forte et
dure , and the burning of females : the
extension of the
benefit of clergy , by abolishing
the pedantic
criterion of
reading : new methods for the
speedy
recovery of rents :
the
establishment
of paper
credit , by recognising
and
giving validity to indorsements
upon bills and notes , and
thus
facilitating for mercantile
purposes the assignment
of choses in action : the translation
of legal
proceedings
into the English
language :
the erection of courts of
conscience for recovering
small
debts, and the reforma-
tion of the county courts : and lastly , the establishing of
our law merchant upon sound and certain principles
: the
extending
to our courts of law of some equitable doctrines ,
and the amplifying
of the remedies respectively available
by actions on promises and on the case .
During the later portion
of the period
under
notice ,
amongst
laws
most generally
operative and affecting our
condition , political , religious , and social , may be enume-
rated the
Reform
Act , the
Roman
Catholic
Relief Act ,
the
various
statutes
for
relieving
non-conformists
from
disabilities , for repealing
enactments which
imposed as a
qualification
for
certain
offices
and
employments
the
sacramental test , and for the further
toleration of dissent .
During this period also the slave trade was abolished , the

ENGLAND .
applicability
of the remedy by habeas corpus was extended
to civil
cases ,
and the
severity
of the game
laws
was
mitigated .
A more liberal
policy
during this period was
observed in reference to the navigation
laws , the
poor
laws
were improved , and
encouragement
was given
by
the
legislature
to
friendly
societies and
savings
banks ,
institutions
well adapted for ameliorating
the condition of
the poorer classes .
During this same period
occurred
a marked
improve-
ment in our criminal law
and its
administration
, the
catalogue of crimes capitally
punishable was much dimin-
ished ,
the
barbarous
accompaniments
of execution
for
treason were done away with, the pillory and the whip-
ping of females
were discontinued .
And to these im-
provements
may be added
the suppression of appeals
in
treason and felony , and of the trial by battle in civil suits ,
the
abolition
of corruption of blood , except in
cases of
treason, murder , or abetting the same.
Moreover , counsel
were allowed for the
defence
in cases of felony ; and the
body of our criminal law was put together in an amended
,
methodised , and digested form .
As regards our civil procedure generally , various useful
measures were at this
time
passed , from amongst which
may be specified those for rendering
more
effectual the
administration
of justice
by abolishing
the courts of the
principality
of Wales and the county palatine of Chester ,
introducing
uniformity
into the
process
of
our
courts ,
amending
and consolidating
the law and practice
as
to
juries ,
preventing
arrest
on
frivolous
grounds
or
for
trivial amounts , improving
and systematising
the laws of
insolvency
and bankruptcy , and establishing
a court
of
bankruptcy .
Amongst
statutory provisions adopted by the legislature
at this
period
affecting
private
property
and dealings
between individuals
, were included
acts which respectively
regulate the law as to factors and the relation
of landlord
and tenant , limit the responsibilities
of land carriers , and

materially amplify the policy of the statute of frauds and
perjuries .
VII. We
have
now
arrived
at the
seventh and last
portion of our
legal
history , during
which
the work of
improvement
has materially
progressed
, and the activity
of our legislature
has been
excessive
.
Since the passing
of the Reform Act , in June , A.D.
1832 , up to the present
time , several thousand statutes have been
enacted , and of
such of them as concern this country
(to which
alone we
can allude) , the tendency has in general been still further
to carry out the policy of our legislature in the immediately
recedent
period .
It
has
been
developed
by
statutes
to extend greatly the franchise , to purify the consciences
and conduct of such as exercise it , and thus to place on a
far broader basis than that on which it had before rested,
the constitution
of the kingdom , which
as having
safely
passed through many and severe ordeals , therefore , is and
ever will be an object of interest
to mankind .
Much has been done
also
during
the
period
under
notice for improving
the social
state of the community .
The condition of the poor has been ameliorated , the rela-
ion of master and
servant , of manufacturer
and work-
nan, has become- though in this particular
much must
ret be done- improved ; and stricter surveillance has been
kept
over
factories
and those
employed in them
than
efore .
Efforts
yet
unperfected
to bring
education and
ts inestimable
benefits within the reach of all
are being
made ; and to the extension of sanitary measures amongst
the lower classes
attention
is being given .
The
erection of
some
new tribunals ,
especially
that
which entertains matrimonial
and divorce cases , and that
which
dispenses justice
in each
locality
throughout
the
country , have thus far had a great ,
and will , there is
reason to believe, hereafter have a yet greater , influence
for good .
The civil procedure of our superior
courts of
equity and
common law has further
been
simplified
and


538
THE
RISE
AND
PROGRESS

THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
amended ; a way being thus in part cleared for that fusion
of law and equity which some desiderate, or for the final
establishment
of one
supreme
court of judicature , of
which other tribunals
shall be but chambers or divisions
.
Should
any
such consummation
be judiciously
effected
,
conjointly
with a revision
of our
statutes , the jurispru
dence
of this country , none
can doubt , will be exalted ,
because the law will be more uniformly administered , and
justice will not fail on the ground
that the judge
appealed
to for it cannot afford redress .
Next in order an important
subject
claims
attention ,
the
briefest
examination
whereof
necessitates
a retro
spect beyond the date at which this period of our epitome
commences .
The
progress
which
reform in the law of real
pro
perty
has made during
the
last
century is not less
re
markable than that which has existed
in
other branches
of our law.
During the past fifty years especially , alte
rations
of a most
marked
and beneficial
character
have
been introduced
by the legislature .
The rendering all land subject to the paramount obliga
tion of paying the debts of its owner both before and after
his decease , is a provision
so obviously consonant to justice ,
that we now wonder at the tenacity with which our ancestors
clung to ideas which had long lost their vital force , and
were never very well founded in reason.
We marvel that
this immunity
ever
existed , but that it should
have con
tinued till within the memory of men
yet young appears
almost
incredible .
That the law is not
easily rendered
perfect , even with such a simple object in view
as this , is
most
true ; as
we
have
seen , it has not
yet reached
a
state approaching
ideal perfection , but the principles
by
which
the modelling
of the law must
be regulated , are
now well ascertained and admitted .
The last
innovation
effected
in the
present
year by which the distinction
between
specialty
and simple
contract
creditors is abo
lished , is especially noticeable for the principle which is


FROM
THE
REFORM

PRESENT
TIME.
539
involved in it ; viz . , of disregarding
all ancient doctrines
and prejudices howsoever derived , when they conflict with
rules
of natural
justice , which
the freedom of thought ,
characteristic
of the present day, renders obvious to every
understanding
.
Again we have seen how the relics of medieval philo
sophy and
a too strict
adherence
to mere artificial
techni
calities
have
been
destroyed
or
rendered
innocuous .
Contingent
remainders , the
existence
of
which
must
necessarily
attend
the
exercise of that
freedom
in the
disposition
of property which modern
notions of liberty
require , have been
released
from the artificial
restraint
and
danger
which
formerly
attended them .
They
are
now capable of having
their natural
effect according to
the intention
of
a settlor ; they are themselves made the
subject of free disposition .
They are only restrained by a
salutary limit as to the time during which a man shall be
permitted to exercise control
over
property .
We recog
nise the sound principle that it is not for the benefit of
society that any person's whims
and caprices
shall con
trol the action and right of posterity .
A reasonable , and
to most minds satisfactory , limit
has been
therefore im
posed or retained , which certainly
does not err on the side
of giving too little liberty .
The singular
caprice of one man has caused
a further
legal
restriction
to be added , one which , had
not expe
rience shown that such unnatural
desires may exist , would
hardly have been anticipated
to be necessary by any spe
culator
in human
nature .
It is now unlawful
to
create
a trust
for accumulation
of income
(except for certain
specified
objects) , to endure beyond the period of twenty
one years after the testator's
or settlor's
death , a period
obviously
chosen by reference to that of legal infancy .
If the
power of alienation
has
been
extended to the
great benefit of all
concerned , the
mode in which
that
alienation
may be effected , has in a still greater
degree
been improved .
Simplicity has been the characteristic of


540
THE RISE
AND
PROGRESS
OF THE
LAWS
OF
ENGLAND .
the changes which have been introduced , but a simplicity
suited to the wants and capabilities
of society in its pre
sent condition .
In ancient times the methods of convey
ance
were of a simple
nature , a man verbally in the
presence of his
neighbours ,
who
were well acquainted
with
his
own
title , made over his
land
upon which he
stood to another ,
and this
public
declaration
operated
as a conveyance.
Simplicity of that kind , however , was
not
such as could
continue , as the law did
not provide
the means of meeting the various
desires of landowners ,
but rather threw every obstacle
in their
way ; by sur
rounding
the
subject
of
tenure
with
technicalities , it
became necessary to use machinery of a highly inconve
nient character . Bargains
and sales for years and releases,
fines and recoveries, held their ground , because , notwith
standing
their
cumbrousness ,
they
effected
what
was
desired.
All
these
technical
difficulties
are now
swept
away, and a simple deed of grant
or assignment , varying
only according to the essential nature of the transaction ,
has replaced all former assurances
.
The almost solitary technicality
as
to language still re
maining ,
that which
requires the use , in a deed , of the
word " heirs " to create an estate
of inheritance ,-might
with advantage be abolished .
It would be simpler
and
more natural
that a grant
should convey a fee simple
or
the whole
estate , whatever it may be , of the grantor , un
less something
else be expressed
; and if it be intended to
restrict
the
grant
to
a life interest ,
nothing
would
be
easier or would more
naturally
occur to the grantor than
to express
such intention by adding the words " for life,"
or " in tail ," or any other suitable words
expressive of
his meaning .
This has already been
done for wills , and
no good reason occurs why the same freedom from techni
cality should not extend to deeds .
The importance is not
great , perhaps , as few deeds
are likely to be prepared by
persons ignorant of the very early rule ; but cui bono the
rule ?
The substitution
of disentailing
and acknowledged
 

541
deeds for fines and recoveries was another revolution
of a
most beneficial kind , and the
present mode of dealing
with the interests which formerly required
a fine or reco
very for their assurance, is almost
free
from
objection .
Though even in this
case we may ask what
good is de
rived from the
inrolment
of a disentailing
deed .
The
improvement
in
the
law
regulating
the
validity
and
construction
of wills
introduced
in the first
year of her
present
Majesty , are amongst
changes
especially
to be
commended .
Though the special value which they possess
can
only be fully recognised by those persons who
are
acquainted with the nature of the difficulties and the cha
racter of the ensuing
litigation
which they were intended
to remove .
It is not likely that any system of statutory
law could obviate the difficulties
which always must arise
in determining
the intention
of testators
so long as free
liberty is given for the exercise of their varied and fanciful
devices in dealing
with their property , and
so long
as
inattention
to
accurate language
continues ,
as it
ever
must continue
to exist in
uneducated or even in educated
minds .
It is much that the
careful
comparison of the
innumerable
errors
and
ambiguities
which
have arisen
has enabled lawyers to classify and distinguish
them by
certain broad rules ; the application of these
rules to the
variations of facts and expressions which must occur , will
always be a cause
of perplexity
and litigation
.
But to
render the formalities , necessary
to a good will , alike for all
species of property , and of a nature easily understood and
complied
with, yet satisfactory in their operation , was
a
valuable contribution
to reform .
The law of inheritance , like
every other ,
even of the
most fundamental
part
of our
jurisprudence ,
has
been
subjected to a careful
scrutiny and subsequent improve
ment .
Accepting
the
doctrine
of
primogeniture
and
priority of males , and assuming
that
a distinction
ought
to
exist
between
the
devolution
of real
and
personal
property , there
are but few points
now to criticise
or

ticed in discussing
the subject .
doctrine
and the
distinction
in
much longer to continue
as the law of the land, seems to
be
matter
of
some
doubt .
There
are
many
actively
working to effect an entire assimilation of the law of real
property
as
regards
devolution
on intestacy
to that of
personal
property ,
and a bill to that
effect has already
been read a second time by the House of Commons . It
does not fall within our province to discuss the merits of
such an innovation .
Another
subject which has occupied a large
portion
of
attention of the legislature , has been that of bankruptcy .
Every attempt to place this part of our law upon a footing
satisfactory
to the community
has hitherto
failed ,
not-
withstanding
that the efforts of our greatest lawyers have
been expended in the attempt .
It would
seem that now
a sufficient
harvest
of experience
has
been
reaped to
enable a sound system to be developed
; and moderate , if
not
sanguine , hopes
may be entertained as to the success
of the measure which this
year
received the sanction of
the legislature .
Amongst
the many
approaching
changes which will be
brought about after no distant interval of time , we may note
that
which
will
place almost
one -half of the community
for the first
time
upon
a legal
footing in
respect of
property .
The
hardship
of married
women
possessing
scarcely any rights
of property
is now being
recognised ,
and will
shortly
cease to exist , or , at all events , be very
greatly alleviated .
Another change worthy of remark re-
lates to the powers which are permitted to be exercised by
aliens over property .
We may shortly expect to see their
present disabilities
abolished .
Glancing
now
for
a few moments
at the
changes
already made in the jurisdiction of our courts of equity :
the simplification
of procedure , the enlargement of powers ,
and tendency to assimilate
the action of the court where

deficient in this respect to that of the common law courts ,
by adopting what is useful of the other jurisdiction with
out losing any of the inherent
powers which the
court
itself possesses -All these , we say , are and must be of
great value.
That the process
of alteration
and remodel
ling is
very far from its termination
is sufficiently
ap
parent to those who have read the report
recently issued
by the Judicature Commission .
It is , therefore , needless
here further to dwell upon this subject .
It will be seen throughout
that a strong spirit of utili
tarianism
has pervaded
the
legislation
of recent times .
As
far
as
possible
to
provide
for
the
difficulties
and
obviate the dangers which experience
has pointed out
as
occurring in practice , has been
a principal
object kept in
view.
Errors
and
misconceptions
are
found
to repeat
themselves
special desires
and wants of a similar cha
racter
occur under most various
circumstances .
Hence
has arisen
a system of legislation
not directly
founded
upon the development of philosophical
ideas of jurispru
dence , but
formed
rather
to
meet the
requirements of
society as constituted at the present day.
As instances of
this we may note the various acts giving new or enlarged
powers to the
court of chancery
for
dealing
with the
administration
of trust and settled
estates
and property
held by several persons in undivided
shares , and lord Cran
worth's
act,
which
declares that deeds

shall be deemed
to contain
certain
clauses , although
no
appearance
of them is to be found within the language of
the parties .
Legislation
of this kind is of great prac
tical benefit , but it is subject to this remark , that ,
as it
does not depend upon
scientific
principles
of law but
rather grows out of the ever -variable
habits
and customs.

in society.
Many
matters
relating
to trade
besides
the law of
bankruptcy
have , since the passing of the Reform
Act ,

of the legislature
; of
such we
can
but
specify
the
position
of the
Bank of
England, and regulation of joint stock banks , of railway
and other companies .
The navigation
laws have also been
repealed, and the laws
as to mercantile
shipping
have
been
consolidated ;
bills
of lading
and
policies
of in-
surance
have
been
made
more
useful
for
mercantile
purposes ; the procedure on bills of exchange has
been
simplified ; and the law of partnership
has been
amended .
The usury laws , long since decried by philosophic jurists ,
have been abolished , and our
postal
system
has
been
remodelled .
Lastly, our criminal
law has
been
consolidated
and
amended , the jurisdiction
of justices of the
peace to con-
vict summarily
has
been
enlarged , magisterial
procedure
has been codified , the law as to oaths and evidence has
been much improved , and the scale of punishments , the
apportioning
of punishment
to crime , and the methods of
punishing
delinquents ,
have
been
brought
more
into
unison with existing
refinement and humanity .
May the great work of legal
improvement
still
con-
tinue ; may the
obstacles which
threaten
to impede
its
progress disappear ; and may one constant rule of right
and justice
be applied throughout
the land !

wrongs and

WE are now arrived at the
fourth
and last branch of Public
these
Commentaries
; which
treats of public wrongs , or punish
crimes .
For we may remember that , in the beginning of
the preceding volume (a) , wrongs were divided
into two
species : the one private , and the
other public .
Private
wrongs, which
are
frequently
termed civil injuries , were
in part the
subject of that book : we are now therefore ,
lastly , to proceed to the consideration
of public wrongs ,
or crimes ; with the means of their prevention and punish
the subject.
In the pursuit of which subject I shall consider , Division of
in the first place, the general nature of crimes and punish
ments ;
secondly ,
the
persons
capable
of
committing
crimes ; thirdly , their several degrees
of guilt ,

NATURE

.
First , gene
ral nature of
crime and
punish
ment.
First, as to the general nature of crime
and punish
ment ; the discussion and admeasurement of which forms
in every country
the
code of criminal
law ;
or ,
as it is
more usually denominated with us in England , the doc
trine of the " pleas of the crown ; " so called , because the
sovereign , in whom
centres
the
majesty
of the
whole
community , is supposed by law to be the person injured
by an infraction
of the public rights
belonging
to that
community , and
is therefore
the
proper
prosecutor for
a public
offence (b) .
Importance
of know
of.
The knowledge
of this branch of jurisprudence
, which
ledgethere- teaches
the nature , extent , and degree of every crime , and
adjusts to it its adequate
and
necessary
penalty , is of the
utmost importance to every individual
in the state.
For (as
a great master of the crown law (c) has observed ) no rank
or elevation in life , no uprightness of heart , no prudence or
circumspection of conduct , should
tempt a man to con
clude , that he may not at some time or other , be deeply
interested in
these
researches
.
The infirmities of the
best among
us, the vices and ungovernable
passions of
others , the instability of human affairs , and the number
less unforeseen events , which the compass of a day may
bring forth, will
teach
us (upon
a moment's
reflection )
that to know with precision what the laws of our country
have forbidden , and the deplorable consequences
to which
a wilful
disobedience may
expose
us, is a matter of uni
versal concern .

and ,
sixthly,
the
method
of
inflicting
those
punishments , which the law has annexed to
each

offence .
In proportion
to
the
importance
of the criminal
law
ought also to be the care
and attention of the legislature
in properly forming and enforcing it. It should be founded

upon
principles
that
are permanent , uniform , and uni-
versal ; and should be always conformable
to the dictates
of truth
and justice , the
feelings of humanity , and the
indelible rights of mankind
; though
it sometimes (pro-
vided

daries ) may be modified , narrowed , or enlarged , according
to the local or occasional necessities
of the state which it is
meant to govern .
And yet , either from a want of atten-
tion to these principles
in the first concoction of the laws ,
and adopting
in their
stead the impetuous
dictates of
avarice , ambition , and revenge ; from
retaining the dis-
cordant political regulations , which
successive
conquerors
or factions have established , in the various
revolutions of
government ; from giving a lasting efficacy to sanctions
that were intended
to be temporary , and made
(as Lord
Bacon expresses
it) merely upon the spur of the occasion ;
or from , lastly , too hastily
employing
such means as are
greatly disproportionate
to their end, in order to check
the progress of some very prevalent
offence : from
some,
or from
all , of these
causes , it has happened , that
the

detain
a
field from another man
,
to
which the law has given him
a
right
,
this
is
a
civil injury
,
not
a
crime
;
for here only the
right
of
an
individual
is
concerned
,
and
it
is
immaterial
to
the public which
of
us
is
in
possession
of
the land
:
but
treason
,
murder
,
and robbery are properly ranked
among
crimes
;
since
,
besides
the injury done
to
individuals
,
they
strike
at
the very being
of
society
,
which
cannot possibly
subsist
,
where actions
of
this sort
are suffered
to
escape
with impunity
.
In
nearly
every case
a
crime
includes
an
injury
;
al-
general
,
also most
every public offence
is
also
a
private
wrong
,
and
somewhat more
;
it
affects the individual
,
and
it
likewise
affects the community
.
Thus treason
in
imagining the
sovereign's death involves
in
it
conspiracy against an indi-
vidual
,
which
is
also
a
civil injury
;
but
,
as
this species
of
treason
in
its consequences
principally tends
to
the disso-
lution
of
government
,
and the destruction
thereby
of
the
order and peace
of
society
,
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
crime
of
the highest
magnitude
.
Murder
is
an
injury
to
the
life
of
an individual
;
but the law
of
society
considers
principally the loss which the
state
sustains by being de-
prived
of
a
member
,
and the pernicious
example
thereby
set for others
to
do the like
.
Robbery may be considered
in
the same view
:
it
is
an injury
to
private property
;
but
were that all
,
a
civil
satisfaction
in
damages might be
allowed
to
atone for
it:
the public
mischief
is
the thing
,
for the prevention
of
which
our
laws
have
made this
offence
severely
punishable
.
In
any
such
gross
and
atrocious injury the private wrong
is
swallowed up
in
the
public
:
we seldom
hear
any
mention
made
of
satis-
faction to the individual
;
the satisfaction
to
the com-
munity
being
so
very great
.
And
indeed
,
as
the public
crime
is
not otherwise
avenged than by forfeiture
of
life
or
liberty and property
,
it
is
in
general impossible
after-
wards
that
any reparation
can be made for the private

5
wrong
for this can only be had from the body or goods
of the aggressor .
But there
are crimes of an inferior
nature ,
in
which
the
public
punishment
is
not
so
severe
but it
affords
room
for
a private
compensation
also ;
and
herein
the
distinction
of
crimes from civil
injuries
is very apparent .
For instance ; in the
case of
battery , or beating
another , the aggressor
may
be in
dicted
for this at suit of the crown , for disturbing the
public peace , and be punished criminally by fine and im
prisonment
;
and
the
party
beaten
may
also have his
private remedy by action
for the injury which he in par
ticular sustains , and
may recover a civil
satisfaction
in
damages .
So also , in case of a public nuisance , as dig
ging a ditch across
a highway , this
is punishable
by in
dictment , as a common offence
to the whole kingdom
and
to
all
her
majesty's
subjects ;
but if
any
individual
sustains
any
special
damage
thereby , his
horse
being
lamed , his carriage
broken , or the like, the offender may
be compelled
to make ample satisfaction , as well for the
private injury as for the public wrong .
Upon the whole we may observe , that in taking cogni
sance of wrongs , or unlawful
acts , the law has a double
view :
viz . not
only
to
redress
the
party
injured ,
by
either restoring
to him his right, if possible ; or by giving
him an equivalent
; the
manner of doing which was the
object of our
inquiries
in the preceding
book of these
Commentaries ; but also to secure to the public the benefit
of society, by preventing
or punishing
every breach and
violation
of those laws , which the sovereign power has
thought
proper
to
establish
for the
government
and
tranquillity of the whole .
What
those breaches
are , and
how prevented
or punished ,
is to be considered in the
present book .
II. The nature of crime in general
being thus ascer
tained
and distinguished
, I proceed in the next place, to
consider the general
nature of punishment
: which is an

being
devised , denounced , and inflicted
by human laws , in con
sequence
of disobedience
or
misbehaviour
in
those , to
regulate whose conduct such laws were respectively made .
And herein we will briefly
consider
the power , the end ,
and the measure of human punishment .
1. As to the power of human punishment , or the right
of the temporal legislator to inflict discretionary
penalties
for crimes (d).
It is
clear
that the right of punishing
crimes against the law of nature , as murder
and the like ,
is in a state of mere nature vested in every individual.
It must
be vested in somebody ;
otherwise the laws of
nature
would
be
vain
and fruitless , if none
were em
powered to put
them in execution : and if that power is
vested in any one , it must also be vested
in all mankind
;
since
all
are by nature
equal.
Whereof the first mur
derer Cain was so sensible , that we find him (e) ,
expres
sing
his
apprehensions , that
whoever
should
find
him
would slay him .
In a state of society this right is trans
ferred from individuals
to the sovereign power ; whereby
men are prevented from being judges in their own causes ,
which is one of the evils that civil government was in
tended to remedy .
Whatever
power therefore individuals
had of punishing
offences
against the law of nature , that
power is now vested in the
magistrate
alone ;
who bears
the sword of justice by consent of the whole community .
As to
offences
merely
against
the
laws
of
society ,
being
only mala prohibita , and
not
mala in se ; the tem
poral
magistrate
is also
empowered
to
inflict
coercive
penalties for such
transgressions : and this by the con
sent of individuals
; who , in forming
societies, did either
tacitly or
expressly invest
the
sovereign power with the
right of making
laws , and of enforcing obedience to them
when
made, by
exercising , upon their
non -observance ,
severities adequate
to the evil .

of punishing
such criminals
is founded
upon this prin
ciple , that the law by which they suffer was made by their
own
consent ; it is
a part of the original contract (ƒ)
into which they entered, when first they engaged in society ;
it was calculated
for , and
has long contributed
to, their
own security .
This right, therefore , being thus conferred by universal
consent , gives to the state exactly the same power , over
all its members , as each individual
member had naturally
over himself or others .

crime committed : for that must be left to the just deter
mination
of the
Supreme
Being :
but
as a precaution
against
future
offences
of the
same kind .
This may be
effected three ways :
either by the
amendment
of the
offender himself, or, by deterring
others by the dread of
his example from offending
in the like way , " ut pœna ad
paucos , metus ad omnes , perveniat ; " (g) or, lastly , by de
priving the
party injuring
ofthe
power to
do
future
mischief , either permanently
or for a season .
The same
one end, of preventing
future crimes , is thus endeavoured
to be answered .
The public gains equal security , whether
the offender himself be amended
by wholesome correction ,
or whether he be disabled
from
doing
any further harm ;
and if the penalty fails in producing
both these
effects , as
it may do, still
the terror
of his
example
remains
as
a
warning
to
other
citizens .
The
method
however
of
inflicting punishment
ought always to be proportioned
to
the
particular
purpose it is
meant to
serve , and by no
means to exceed it.

but it must
be left to the arbitration of the legislature to

inflict
such penalties
as are warranted
by the laws of
nature and society, and such as appear to be best calcu
lated
to answer
the
end
of precaution
against
future
offences .
Hence it will
be evident , that what some
have
so
highly extolled
for its
equity , the lex talionis , or law of
retaliation , cannot be a
fit
or
adequate rule
of
punish
ment
.
It
is
unequal
in
its operation
;
for
a
difference
of
person
,
place
,
time
,
provocation
,
or
other
circumstance
,
may enhance
or
mitigate the offence
;
and
if
so
,
retaliation
cannot
be
a
proper measure
of
justice
.
If
a
man mali
ciously should put out the remaining
eye
of
him who had
lost
one
before
,
it
is
too
slight
a
punishment
for the
maimer
to
lose only one
of
his
and therefore the law of
the Locrians
,
which
demanded an eye for an eye
,
was
in
this instance judiciously altered by decreeing
,
in
imita
tion
of
Solon's laws
(
),
that he who struck
out the
eye
of
a
one
-
eyed man
,
should
lose both his own
in
return
.
Besides
,
there are very many crimes
,
that will
in
no shape
admit
of
these penalties
,
without
manifest
absurdity
and
wickedness
.
Theft
cannot
be punished
by theft
,
defa
mation
by defamation
,
forgery
by forgery
,
adultery
by
adultery
,
and the like
.
And
we may
add
,
that those
instances
,
wherein
retaliation
appears
to
be
used
,
even by
the divine
authority
,
do
not really proceed
upon the rule
of
exact retribution
,
by doing
to
the criminal
the
same
hurt he has
done
to
his neighbour
,
and
no more
but
this correspondence between the crime and punishment
is
barely
a
consequence from some other principle
.
Death
is
ordered
to
be punished with death
;
not because one
is
equivalent
to
the other
,
for that would
be
expiation
,
and
not punishment
.
Nor
is
death always
an
equivalent
for
death
the execution
of
a
needy decrepit
assassin
is
a
poor
satisfaction
for the
murder
of
a
nobleman
in
the
bloom
of
his youth
,
and full enjoyment
of
his friends
,
his
honours
,
and his fortune
.
But
the
reason upon which
(h)

MEASURE
OF

.

this sentence is grounded
seems
to be , that this
is the
highest
penalty that man can inflict , and tends most to
the security of mankind
; by removing one murderer from
the earth , and setting
a dreadful example to deter others :
so that
even
this grand
instance
proceeds
upon
other
principles
than
those of retaliation .
And truly , if any
measure of punishment
is to be taken from the damage
sustained by the sufferer, the punishment
ought rather to
exceed than equal
the injury : since it seems contrary to
reason
and
equity , that the guilty (if convicted ) should
suffer no more than the innocent
has
done
before him ;
especially
as the
suffering
of the innocent
is past and
irrevocable , that of the guilty is future , contingent , and
liable to be escaped
or evaded .
With regard
indeed to
crimes that are incomplete , which
consist merely in the
intention , and are not yet carried into act, as conspiracies
and the like ; the innocent
has a chance to frustrate
or
avoid the villany, as the conspirator has
also a chance
to
escape his punishment
: and this may be one reason why
the lex talionis
is
more proper to be inflicted , if at all,
for crimes that consist in intention , than
for such as are
carried into act.
It seems
indeed consonant to
natural
reason , and has therefore
been
adopted
as
a maxim
by
several theoretical writers ( ) , that the punishment
due to
the crime of which
one falsely
accuses
another , should be
inflicted
on the perjured
informer .
Accordingly
, when it
was once attempted
to introduce into England the law of
retaliation
, it was intended
as a punishment
for such only
as preferred
malicious
accusations
against
others ; it
being
enacted by statute
37 Edw . 3,
c. 18 , that
such as
preferred
any
suggestions
to the king's great
council
should
put in sureties of taliation
;
that
is , to
incur
the
same pain that the other
should
have had , in
case
the suggestion were found
untrue .
But , after one year's
experience ,
this
punishment
of
taliation
was
rejected
,
and imprisonment
adopted
in
its
stead

NATURE
OF
CRIME
AND
PUNISHMENT
.
But
though
from what
has been
said it appears , that
there
cannot
be any regular
or determinate
method
of
rating the quantity of punishment
for crime , by any one
uniform
rule ; that it must
be
referred to the will and
discretion
of the
legislative
power : yet there
are
some
general
principles , drawn
from
the nature
and circum
stances
of a crime , that
may be of some assistance
in
allotting to it an adequate
punishment .
As , first , with regard to the object of it : for the greater
and more exalted the object of an injury is , the more care
should be taken
to prevent
that
injury,
and of course.
under this
aggravation
the punishment
should be
more
severe .
Therefore
treason in compassing and conspiring
the death ofthe sovereign is by the English law punished
with greater rigour than even actually killing any private
subject .
And yet , generally , a design to transgress is not
so flagrant an enormity , as the actual completion of that
design .
For evil , the nearer we approach it, is the more
disagreeable
and
shocking :
so
that
it
requires
more
obstinacy in wickedness to perpetrate
an unlawful
action ,
than barely to entertain the thought of it : and it is an
encouragement to repentance and remorse , even till the
last stage of any crime , that it never is too late to retract ;
and that if a man
stops
even
here , it is better for him
than if he proceeds : for which reason an attempt
to rob ,
to ravish , or to kill , is less penal than the actual robbery ,
rape, or murder .
But in the
case of a treasonable con
spiracy , the object whereof is the king's majesty , the bare
intention will deserve
the highest
degree
of severity ; not
because
the intention
is equivalent
to the act itself : but
because
the greatest rigour is no more than
adequate
to a
treasonable purpose of the heart manifested by some overt
act, and there is no greater left to inflict upon the actual
execution of the deed .
Again : the violence of passion may sometimes alleviate
a crime .
To kill a man upon sudden and violent resent
ment , is less penal than upon cool deliberate malice .

age, education , and character of the offender ; the repe
tition (or otherwise ) of the
offence
; the time , the place,
the company wherein it was committed ; all these , and
a
thousand
other incidents , may aggravate
or extenuate a
crime (1).
:
Further
as
punishment
is
chiefly
intended
for
the
prevention
of future
crime , it is
but
reasonable
that
among crimes of different
natures
those should be most
severely punished , which
are the most destructive of the
public safety and happiness (m) ; and, among crimes of
an
equal
malignity , those which
a man
has the
most
frequent and easy opportunities of committing
, which can
not be so easily guarded
against
as others , and which
therefore the
offender has the strongest
inducement
to
commit
according to what Cicero observes (n ) , " ea sunt
animadvertenda peccata
maxime,
quæ
difficillime
præca
ventur."
Hence it is , that
larceny by a servant is more
severely
punishable
than by a stranger .
And ,
in
the
island of Man , the rule adverted to was formerly
carried
so far, that to take
away a horse or an ox was there no
felony , but
a trespass ,
because
of the difficulty in that
little
territory
to conceal them , or carry
them off ; but
to steal
a pig
or a fowl ,
which is
easily
done , was a
capital
misdemeanor , and the offender was punished with
death (0).
Lastly
as a conclusion
to the
whole , we may observe

that
punishments
of
unreasonable
severity ,
especially
when
indiscriminately
inflicted , have less
effect in pre
venting

the

.
intermixed
with due distinctions
of severity .
It is the
sentiment of an ingenious writer , who
seems to have well
studied the springs of human
action (p ) , that crimes are
more effectually prevented by the
certainty , than by the
severity of punishment .
For the excessive severity
of
laws
(says
Montesquieu
(q))
hinders
their
execution ;
when
the punishment
surpasses
all measure , the public
will frequently
out of humanity
prefer
impunity to it.
Thus also the
statute
1
Mar.
st.
1 , c.
1 , recites in its
preamble , " that
the state of every king
consists
more
assuredly in the love of the subject towards their prince ,
than in the dread of laws made with rigorous
pains
; and
that laws made for the preservation of the commonwealth
without great penalties are more often
obeyed
and
kept ,
than laws made with extreme punishments " (r).
Happy
had it been for the nation , if the
subsequent practice of
that
deluded
princess in
matters of religion , had
been
correspondent
to
these sentiments of herself
and parlia
ment , in matters
of state and government !
We may
further
observe
that sanguinary
laws
are a bad symptom
of the distemper of any state , or at least of its weak con
stitution .
The laws of the Roman kings , and the twelve
(p) Beccar . c. 7.
(q) Sp. L. b. 6, c. 13.
(r) So the statute
1 Edw.
6,
c.
12, sets forth
in its preamble
that
"Nothing is more godly , more sure ,
more to be wished
and
desired be
twixt
a prince , the
supreme head
and ruler ,
and
the
subjects
whose
governor
and
head he is, than
on
the
prince's
part
great
clemency
and
indulgency ,
and
rather
too
much
forgiveness
and
remission
of
his
royal
power
and just punish
ment , than
exact severity
and jus
tice to be shewed ; and on the sub
jects ' behalf , that
they should obey
rather for love , and for the necessity
and love of a king and prince than
for fear of his strait and severe laws ."
It therefore
repeals
every
statute
which had created any treason since
the 25 Edw. 3, st.
5,
c. 2.
It re
peals " all and every Act of Parlia
ment
concerning
doctrine
or mat
ters of religion ." It repeals
every
felony
created by the
legislature
,
during
the
preceding
reign
of
Henry VIII .
It likewise
repeals
the
statute
31
Hen .
8,
enacting
" that proclamations
made by the
king's highness ,
by the
advice of
his
honorable
council ,
should
be
made
and
kept
as
though
they
were made by authority of parlia
ment ."

tables of the
decemviri , were full of cruel punishments
:
the Porcian law, which
exempted all citizens
from sen-
tence of death , silently
abrogated
them .
In this
period
the republic flourished
: under the emperors
severe
pun-
ishments were revived ; and then the empire fell.
It is moreover absurd
and impolitic
to apply the same
punishment
to crimes of different
malignity .
A multi-
tude of sanguinary
laws (besides the doubt that
may be
entertained
concerning
the
right
of making
them )
do
likewise
prove a manifest defect either in the wisdom of
the legislative , or the strength of the executive power. It
is a kind of quackery in government , and argues
a want of
solid skill , to apply the same universal
remedy , the ulti-
mum supplicium , to every case of difficulty .
It is, it must
be owned, much easier to extirpate
than to amend man-
kind ; yet that magistrate must be esteemed
both a weak
and
a cruel
surgeon ,
who
cuts
off every limb
which
through
ignorance
or indolence
he will not attempt
to
cure . It has been therefore ingeniously
proposed (s) , that
in every state a scale of crimes should
be formed , with a
corresponding
scale of punishments , descending from the
greatest to the least : but, if that be too romantic
an idea,
yet at least a wise legislator will
mark the principal
divi-
sions of offences , and leave to judicial discretion
within
certain
indicated
limits
the
task of
meting
out their
punishment .
The inflicting of capital
punishment , now of compara-
tively
rare occurrence ,
has
been
thus justified by that
great
and good
man ,
sir
Matthew
Hale (t) :
" When
offences
grow
enormous , frequent ,
and
dangerous
to
a
kingdom
or state, destructive or highly pernicious
to civil
societies
, and
to the great
insecurity
and danger of the
kingdom
or
its inhabitants , severe
punishment , and even
death itself, is necessary to be annexed to laws in many
cases by the prudence of lawgivers ."
It is therefore the
enormity , or dangerous tendency , of the crime that
alone
(8) Beccar . c. 6.

can
warrant
any earthly
legislature
in putting him to
death who commits it.
It is not its frequency
only , or
the difficulty
of otherwise preventing
it, that will excuse
our
attempting
to prevent it by a wanton
effusion
of
human blood .
For , though the end of punishment
is to
deter
men
from
offending , it
never
can
follow
from
thence , that it is lawful to deter them at any rate and by
any means ; since there
may
be unlawful
methods
of
enforcing
obedience
even
to the
justest
laws .
Every
humane legislator will
be therefore
extremely cautious of
establishing
laws
that inflict the penalty of death , espe
cially for slight
offences , or such as are merely positive .
To shed the blood of our fellow -creature is a matter that
requires the greatest deliberation
and the fullest convic
tion of our own authority
: for
life
is the immediate gift
of God to man ; which
neither
he can resign , nor
can it
be taken from him, unless by the command or permission
of him who gave it : either expressly revealed , or collected
from
the laws of nature or society by clear and indispu
table demonstration .



CHAPTER II.

capableof
crimes.
HAVING , in the preceding chapter , considered in general Persons
the nature
of crime , and punishment , we are
next
led , committing
in the order of our
distribution
, to inquire
what
persons
are , or are not , capable of committing
crimes ; who
are
exempted from the censures of the law upon the commis-
sion of acts , which
in
other persons would
be severely
punished .
In the
process
of this
inquiry, we must have
recourse
to particular
and
special
exceptions :
for
the
general
rule
is, that no person
shall
be
excused
from
punishment for disobedience to the laws of his
country ,
excepting
such as are expressly defined and exempted by
the laws themselves .
be a vicious
unlawful act
thereon.
We have seen that a criminal
act is
one
which
affects
There must
prejudicially
the
public ; it must
also (subject to some will, and
few and peculiar exceptions) have proceeded
from a guilty consequent
mind.
So that the several pleas and excuses , which
pro-
tect the committer of a forbidden act from the punishment
which is otherwise
annexed thereto , may in general
be
reduced to this single
consideration , the want or defect of
will.
An involuntary
act , as it has no claim to merit , so
neither
can it induce
any guilt : the concurrence of the
will , when it has its choice either to
do or to avoid the
fact in question , being the only thing that renders human
actions
either praiseworthy
or culpable .
Indeed , to make
a complete crime
cognisable by human laws , there must
be both a will and an act.
For though , in foro conscientiæ ,
a fixed design or will to do an
unlawful
act is almost
as

Caseswhere
the will does
the act.
heinous
as the
commission
of it, yet ,
as
no
temporal
tribunal can search the heart , or fathom
the
intentions of
the mind , otherwise
than as they are demonstrated by
outward actions , it therefore cannot punish for that which
it cannot know.
For which reason in all temporal juris-
dictions an overt act, or some open evidence of an intended
crime , is necessary in order to demonstrate the depravity
of the will , before the
accused
is liable to punishment .
And ,
as
a vicious will without a vicious
act is no civil
crime , so , on the other hand , an unwarrantable
act with-
out
a vicious will may be no crime
at all .
So that to
constitute
a
crime
against
human
laws ,
there
must in
almost all
cases
be, first , a vicious will ; and , secondly ,
an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will .
Now there are three
cases , in which
the will
does
not
not join with join with the act :
1. Where
there is a defect of under-
standing .
For where there is no discernment , there is no
choice ; and where there is no choice, there can be no act
of the will , which is nothing
else
but a determination of
one's choice to do or to abstain
from a particular
action
:
he, therefore , who has no understanding , can have no will
to guide his conduct .
2. Where
there is understanding
and will sufficient , residing
in the party ; but not called
forth and exerted at the time of the action done ; as where
an offence
is committed by mischance or ignorance .
Here
the will
sits
neuter ; and neither
concurs with the
act,
nor disagrees to it.
3. Where
the action
is constrained
by some
outward
force
and
violence .
Here
the
will
counteracts the deed
; and is so far from concurring with ,
that it loathes and disagrees to, what the man is obliged
to perform . It will be the business of the present chapter ,
briefly to consider the several
species of defect in will , as
they fall under some one or other of these
general heads :
as
infancy ,
idiocy , lunacy ,
and intoxication , which
fall
under the
first
class ; misfortune , and ignorance , which
may be referred to the second
; and
compulsion
or neces-
sity , which may properly rank in the third.


DEFECT
OF UNDERSTANDING - INFANCY .
17
I. First, we will consider the case of infancy , or nonage : I. Infancy.
during which
there
is
a
defect of the
understanding .
Infants ,
under
the
age of discretion ,
ought
not to be
punished
by any criminal
prosecution
(a) .
The
age of
discretion
has , in various
nations , varied .
The civil law
distinguished
the age of minors , or males under twenty
five years old , into three stages
: infantia , from birth till
seven years of age ; pueritia , from seven to fourteen ; and
pubertas , from
fourteen
upwards (6).
The
period
of
pueritia,
or
childhood ,
was
again
subdivided
into two
equal
parts
from
seven to ten
and a half was
ætas
infantia proxima ;
from ten and a half to fourteen
was
ætas pubertati proxima .
During the first stage of infancy
and the next half
stage
of childhood , infantiæ
proxima ,
persons were not punishable
for any crime (c) .
During
the other half stage of childhood , approaching
to puberty ,
from ten and a half to fourteen , they were indeed punish
able , if found to be doli
capaces , or capable of mischief
;
but with many
mitigations , and
not with the
utmost
rigour of the law (d).
During the last stage (at the age
of puberty , and
afterwards ) ,
minors
were
liable
to be
punished , as well capitally
as otherwise .
The law of England
does in some
cases
privilege
an
infant, under the age of twenty -one , as to common misde
meanors , so as to escape fine , imprisonment , and the like :
and particularly in cases of omission , as not repairing
a
bridge (e) , or a highway , and other similar
offences (f) :
for not having
the command of his
fortune till twenty
one , he wants the capacity to do those things
which
the
law requires .
But where there is any notorious breach of
the
peace ,
a riot, battery , assault (g) , or the like (which

infants , when full grown , are
at least
as likely as others
to commit ) , for
these
an infant , above
the
age of four
teen , is equally liable to suffer as a person of the full age
of twenty -one .
With regard to capital
crimes , the law is still
more
minute
and
circumspect ;
distinguishing
with
greater
nicety the several
degrees
of age
and discretion .
By the
ancient
Saxon
law, the age of twelve
years was esta
blished
for the
age of possible
discretion , when first the
understanding
might open ( ) ; and from
thence till the
offender was fourteen , it was
ætas pubertati
proxima , in
which
he might or might
not be guilty of a crime , ac
cording to his natural
capacity or incapacity .
This was
the dubious
stage of discretion : but , under
twelve it was
held that he could not be guilty in will, neither after four
teen could he be supposed innocent , of any capital crime
which
he had in fact committed .
But by the law, as it
now stands , and has stood at least ever since the time of
Edward III. , the capacity
of doing
ill
,
or
contracting
guilt
,
is
not
so
much
measured
by years and days
,
as
by
the strength
of
the delinquent's
understanding
and judg
ment
.
For one lad
of
eleven years old may have
as
much
cunning
as
another
of
fourteen
;
and
in
these
cases
our
maxim
is,
that
"
malitia
supplet
ætatem
."
Under seven
years
of
age
,
indeed
,
an
infant
cannot
be guilty
of
felony
(
);
for
then
a
felonious
discretion
is
almost
an
impossibility
in
nature
:
but
at
eight years old he may
be
guilty
of
felony
(k).
Also
,
under
fourteen
,
though
an
infant shall
be
prima facie adjudged
to
be
doli
incapax
;
yet
if
it
appear
to
the court and jury that he was doli
capax
,
and could discern between good and evil
,
he
may
be convicted and punished
(7).
Thus
a
girl
of
thirteen
has been burnt for killing
her mistress
:

ten

of
nine years old

because
it appeared upon their
trials, that
the
one hid himself, and the other hid the

ness

cumstances of much difficulty and nicety ;
for
instance ,
where there is mental
obliquity
in
reference
only to par
ticular
subjects ,
or where the mental
capacity ,
though
weak and clouded , is still such as might presumably
have
availed
to restrain
from
committing
crime .
As regards
the condition
of mind
first
supposed, the opinion of the
judges (r) in
M'Naghten's
Case (s) , sanctioned
by the
House of Lords , must guide
us ; there certain
questions ,
bearing
directly
on this
subject , were formally proposed
to the judges , which ,
with
the
answers to
them ,
are
below set out :-
1st. " What is the law respecting alleged crimes
com
mitted by persons afflicted with insane delusions in respect
of one or more particular
subjects
or persons ;
as, for
instance , where ,
at the
time of the
commission
of the
alleged
crime , the accused knew he was acting
contrary
to law, but did the act complained of with a view , under
the influence of insane delusion , of redressing or revenging
some supposed
grievance
or injury, or of producing
some
supposed public benefit ? "
To which question the answer was as follows -Assuming
that the inquiries
are confined to persons who labour under
such partial delusions
only , and are not in other respects
insane , notwithstanding
the party
accused
did
the
act
complained of with a view , under the influence of insane
delusion , of redressing or revenging
some supposed griev
ance or injury, or of producing
some public benefit , he is
nevertheless
punishable , according
to the
nature of the
crime committed , if he knew at the time of committing
such
crime that he was acting contrary to the law of the land.
2nd . " What
are the proper questions to be submitted
to the jury when
a person
alleged
to be afflicted with
insane delusion respecting
one or more particular
subjects
or persons is charged with the commission of a crime , and
insanity
is set up as
a
defence ?" and 3rd , " In what
terms ought the question to be left to the jury as to the

prisoner's
state
of mind
at the
time when the
act was
committed ?"
To these
two questions
the answer judicially returned
was-" The jury ought to be told in all cases that every
man
is to be presumed to be
sane (†) , and
to possess
a
sufficient degree
of reason
to be responsible for his crimes ,
until
the
contrary
be
proved to their
satisfaction ; and
that to establish
a defence
on the ground
of insanity , it
must be clearly proved , that , at the time of committing
the act, the
party
accused
was
labouring
under
such
a
defect of reason , from disease
of the mind , as not to know
the nature and quality of the
act he was doing , or if he
did know it, that
he did
not know he was doing what
was wrong .
If the
accused
was conscious that the act
was one which he ought not to do , and if that act was at
the same time
contrary to the law of the
land ,
he
is
punishable ; and the
usual
course
therefore has been , to
leave the question to the jury , whether
the party accused
had a sufficient
degree
of reason to know that
he was
doing
an
act
that
was wrong ;
this
course
is
correct ,
accompanied
with
such
observations
and
explanations
as the
circumstances
of
each
particular
case
may re-
quire (u).
4th. " If
a
person
under
an
insane
delusion
as
to
existing
facts commits an offence in consequence
thereof ,
is he thereby excused
?"
To which question the answer was-That if the accused
labours under a partial
delusion only , and is not in other

that the
deceased
had
inflicted
a serious injury to his
character and fortune , and he killed him in revenge for
such supposed injury, he would be liable to punishment .
In regard to the condition of mind at page 20 , secondly
supposed, we may observe
that , although
a total tem-
porary absence
of reason at the time when an offence
was
committed
will
excuse ,
yet if there
be only a
partial
degree of imbecility , allowing a competent
use of the
reasoning
faculty
sufficient
to
have
restrained
those
passions which
produced
the act charged
as criminal , if
there be thought
and design , a power to distinguish
the
nature of actions , to discern the difference between good
and evil , then
the
fact of the
offence
being
proved , the
judgment of the law must ensue and take effect (x).
According
to
our common law, if a man in his sound
memory commits
a
capital
offence , and
before arraign-
ment
for
it,
he
becomes
mad ,
he
ought
not
to be
arraigned
for it ; because
he
is not able to plead to it
with that advice and caution
that he ought .
And if,
after he has pleaded , the prisoner becomes
mad , he shall
not be tried : for how can he make his defence
? If after
he be tried and found guilty , he
loses
his
senses
before
judgment , judgment shall
not
be
pronounced :
and if,
after judgment , he becomes of nonsane memory , execution
shall
be stayed : for peradventure , says
the humanity of
the English law, had the prisoner been of sound memory ,
he might
have alleged something in stay of judgment
or
execution (y).
Indeed , in the bloody reign of Henry VIII . ,
a statute was made (≈) , which
enacted , that if a person ,
being
compos
mentis , should
commit
high treason , and
after fall into madness , he might be tried in his absence ,
and should suffer death, as if he were of perfect memory .
This savage and
inhuman
law was
however repealed by

the jury must
find

he

and
thereupon

so
that

,
the court may record such finding

and
if
such accused

which ,
de-
priving men of their reason , puts them in a temporary
frenzy ; our law looks
upon this as an aggravation of the
offence , rather than as an excuse
for any criminal
misbe-
haviour .
A drunkard , says
sir
Edward
Coke (c) , who is
voluntarius
dæmon , hath no privilege
thereby ; but
what
hurt or
ill
soever he doth

his drunkenness
doth aggravate

It
has
been
observed
,
that
the

of
strong
liquors
,
and
the abuse
of
them by drinking
to
excess
,
depend much
upon the temperature
of
the
climate
in
which
we live
.
The
same indulgence
,
which
may be
necessary
to
make
the
blood

Norway
,
would
make
an
Italian
mad

A
German

therefore

says the President
Montes-

custom

a

drinks

he
adds
,
ought
to
be more
severely punished
,
where
it
makes men mischievous and mad
,
as
in
Spain
and Italy
,
than where
it
only renders them
stupid
and heavy
,
as
in
Germany and more northern countries
.
And accordingly
,
in
the warm climate
of
Greece
,
a
law
of
Pittacus
enacted
,
"
that he who
committed
a

But the law of England ,
con

weak
an excuse it is (though
real ) , will
not suffer any
man thus to privilege
one crime by another (g).
Nevertheless where malice or a particular

Of this, when it affects

that if any

if a man be doing anything

error in point
of law.
As if a man , intending
to kill a
burglar in his own house , by mistake kills
one of his own
family, this is no criminal
action ( ) : but if a man thinks
he has a right to kill a person excommunicated
or out
lawed , wherever
he
meets him,
and
does
so ; this is
wilful murder.
For
a mistake
in point of law, which
every person of discretion not only may , but is bound and
presumed to know, is in criminal
cases no sort of defence .
Ignorantia juris, quod
quisque
tenetur
scire, neminem
ex

well
the maxim
of our own
(1) , as it
was
of the Roman law (m).
VI. A sixth
species
of defect of will is that
arising
from
compulsion
or
inevitable
necessity ;
from
a con
straint upon the will , whereby a man is urged to do that
which
his judgment
disapproves ; and which , it is to be
presumed , his will (if left to itself) would
reject.
As
punishments
are only
inflicted
for the abuse of that free
will, which
God has given to man , it is therefore highly
just
and equitable
that
a man
should
be
excused for
those acts
which
are done through unavoidable force and
compulsion .

or sound
morality .

Ignorance
of a
law which is of very
recent
enact
ment may , however , in
some cases
afford just ground
for application
to
the
leniency
of the
crown .
Thus
where the prisoner
was indicted for
maliciously
shooting , and the offence
was committed
within a few weeks
after the passing of the 39 Geo. 3,
c. 37, and before notice
of it could
have
reached the place where the
offence was committed ,
the judges
thought
that , as he could not
have
known of that act, he ought to have
a pardon .

excuse will be admitted
in foro
conscientiæ , or
whether
the inferior in this case is
not bound to obey the divine ,
rather
than the human law, it is not my business to de
cide ; though
the
question , I believe, among the casuits ,
will hardly bear a doubt (n).
But , however that may be ,
obedience to the laws in being is undoubtedly
a sufficient
extenuation
of civil guilt before the municipal
tribunal .
The sheriff , who burnt Latimer and Ridley, in the bigoted
days of Queen Mary, was not liable to punishment
from
Elizabeth, for executing so horrid
an office ; being justi
fied
by the
commands
of that
magistracy ,
which
en
deavoured to restore superstition
under the holy auspices
of its merciless sister , persecution .
and wife.
As to persons
in private
relations ;
constraint
of
a Husband
superior
is sometimes allowed
as an
excuse for criminal
misconduct , by reason of the matrimonial
subjection
of
the wife to her husband ; but neither
a son nor a servant
is excused for the commission
of any crime , by the com
mand or coercion of the parent or master (o).
Thus if a
woman commit theft , or burglary , by the coercion of her
husband ; or even
in his company , which
the law primâ
facie construes
a coercion : she
is dispunishable ,
being
considered to have
acted
by
compulsion , and not of her
own will (p).
Which
doctrine
is
at
least
a thousand
years old in this kingdom , being
to be found
among the
laws of king Ina , the West
Saxon (7).
And it
appears
that
among the northern
nations
on the
continent , this
privilege
extended to any woman transgressing
in concert
with a man , and to any servant who committed
a joint
offence
with a freeman ; the male or freeman
only
was
punished , the female or slave was dismissed : " proculdubio
quod alterum
libertas ,
alterum
necessitas
impelleret (r)”.
But, (besides
that in our law,
which
is
a stranger
to
slavery , no impunity is given
to servants ,

much free agents
as their masters) even with regard to
wives this rule
admits of exception in the case of crimes
that are mala in se , and prohibited
by the law of nature ,
as murder (s) and the like : not only because
these are of
a deeper
dye, but also , since in a state of nature no one is
in
subjection
to another , it would
be unreasonable
to
screen
an offender from the punishment
due to natural
crimes , by the refinements
and
subordinations
of civil
society.
In
treason
also
(the
highest
crime
which
a
member of society can, as such , be guilty of) , no plea of
coverture
shall
excuse
the wife ; no presumption
of the
husband's
coercion shall
extenuate her guilt (t) : as well
because
of the odiousness and dangerous
consequence
of
the crime itself, as
because
the
husband , having
broken
through the most sacred
tie of social community by rebel-
lion against the state, has no right to that obedience
from
a wife , which he himself as a subject has forgotten to pay.
In some inferior
misdemeanors
also we may remark ex-
ceptions to the
rule
which
confers immunity
on a feme
covert
thus husband and wife may be jointly convicted of
an
assault (u) ,
and
a wife
may
be indicted
with her
husband for keeping
a brothel
;
for this
is
an
offence
touching
the
domestic
economy
or
government
of the
house, in which
the wife
has a principal
share ; and is
also such an offence
as the law presumes to be generally
conducted by the intrigues
of the female
sex (x) .
And
where the
wife
offends alone ,
without
the
company
or
coercion of her husband , she is responsible for her offence ,
as much as any feme sole.
2. Another
species of compulsion
or necessity is what
our law
calls
duress
per
minas (y) ;
or
threats
and
menaces , which
induce a fear of death or bodily
harm ,
and which
may take away for that reason the guilt of

tribunal .
But then that
fear which compels a man to do an unwarrantable
action ,
ought to be just
and well-grounded
;
such , " qui cadere

as
Bracton

in the words of the civil

sion of the

rebels , which
would
admit

This however
seems
only , or at least principally, to hold as to positive
crimes ,

laws of society ; and
which
therefore
society may
excuse ; but
not
as
to
natural
offences
so
declared by the law of God , wherein

(b) At the
trial of the Duke of
Hamilton
for
treason , during the
time
of the Commonwealth
(4 St.
Tr. 1167-8), the subject
supra was
discussed .
The charge against
the
duke was that he had
traitorously
invaded
this
country
in a hostile
manner , and levied war against the
people , &c.; and to this charge the
answer first relied
upon
was, that
the accused had acted
by command
of
the
parliament
of
Scotland ,
which he could not disobey without
"incurring the severest censures ;"
that
the duke
had
acted but as a
servant in the matter
under investi
gation ,
and
was
tied by oaths and
penalties
to give obedience : if he
had
disobeyed , he had
been liable
to
punishment
;
therefore
it
was
hard
for him
to
be
punished
for
obeying
also .
Referring
to
the
ground thus relied on , the Attorney
General for the Commonwealth
ad
mitted
the rule as
generally
true
" that a man is not to be punished
for
an act which he doth
by the
necessity
of obedience ,
because he
hath
not
solutum
arbitrium ; but
(said the Attorney -General ) this rule
is
capable of restriction , as well in
law as in reason ; for , if the act be
lawful,
a superior
command
may
dispense with some
circumstances ,
but if unlawful, the
servant obey
ing is not the
less to be blamed .
Necessity
of obedience
may excuse
in privatis, but never in publicis

valet privilegium
contra rem
publicam ."
The duke of Hamilton
was convicted
and executed .

And
therefore , though
a man
be violently
assaulted , and has
no other possible means of escaping death, but by killing
an innocent person ; this
fear
and force shall
not acquit
him of murder ;
for he ought
rather
to die himself, than
escape by the murder of an innocent (d).
But in such a
case he is permitted to kill the assailant ; for there the law
of nature and self - defence , its primary canon, have made
him his own protector .
.
3.
There is a third species of necessity , which
may be
distinguished
from the actual compulsion of external force
or fear ; being the result of reason and reflection , which
act upon and constrain a man's will , and oblige him to do
an action , which without such obligation would be criminal .
And that is , when a man
has his choice of two evils set
before him , and being under
a necessity of choosing one ,
he
chooses the less
pernicious of the two .
Here the will
cannot be said freely
to exert itself, being rather passive
than
active ;
or, if active , it
is rather in rejecting
the
greater
evil
than in
choosing the less .
Of this
sort is
that necessity,
where
a man by
the
commandment
of
the law is bound to arrest another for a felony , or to dis-
perse a riot , and resistance
is made to his authority : it
may here be justifiable and
even necessary to beat, to
wound , or perhaps to kill the offenders, rather than permit
the murderer to escape , or the riot to continue .
For the
preservation of the peace of the kingdom , and the appre-
hending of notorious
malefactors , are of the utmost con-
sequence to the public ; and therefore
excuse the felony ,
which the killing would otherwise amount to (e).
4. There
is yet another
case of necessity, which
has
occasioned
speculation
among
writers
upon general law ,
although free from doubt in our own ; viz. whether a man
in extreme want of food or clothing
may justify stealing
either , to relieve his
present necessities ?

Grotius (f) and Puffendorf (g) , together with other foreign
jurists , have held in the affirmative ; maintaining
by many
ingenious , humane , and
plausible
reasons, that in
such
cases the community of goods by a kind of tacit concession
of society is revived .
And some
even of our own lawyers
have held the

doctrine ,
borrowed
from
the
notions of
some
civilians
at least it is now antiquated , the law of England
admitting no such

of the

Cicero (k) , who holds
that " suum cuique

de alterius commodis

;" but also to the Jewish
law, as certified by king Solomon himself (1) : " if a thief
steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry , he shall restore
seven -fold , and shall give all the substance
of his house:"
which was
the
ordinary
punishment
for theft
in
that
kingdom .
And this is founded upon the highest reason :
for men's properties would be under a strange insecurity , if
liable to be
invaded
according
to the wants of others , of
which wants no man can possibly
be an adequate judge ,
but the party himself who pleads them .
In this country ,
especially , there would be a peculiar impropriety in admit
ting so dubious an excuse
for by our laws such sufficient
provision
is made for the poor by the power of the civil
magistrate , that it
is
impossible
that the most
needy
stranger
should
ever
be
reduced
to the
necessity of
thieving to support
nature .
Therefore
our laws
ought
by no means to be taxed with
being
unmerciful
for deny
ing this privilege
to the necessitous ; especially when we
consider that the crown on the representation of its min
isters of justice , has
a power
to
soften the
law, and to
extend mercy in cases of peculiar hardship .

several
cases , in which the incapacity of
posedto be committing
crime arises from
a deficiency of the will , we
incapableof
may add one more , in which
the law
supposes
an inca-
pacity of doing wrong , from the excellence and perfection
of the person ; which
extend
as well to the will as to the
other
qualities
of the mind .
I mean the
case
of the
sovereign ; who by virtue of his royal
prerogative , is not
under the coercive power of the law (m) ; which will
not
suppose him capable of committing
a folly, much
less
a
crime .
We are therefore , out of reverence
and decency
to
forbear any idle inquiries
as to what would
be the con-
sequence if the
sovereign were to act thus
and thus ;
since the law deems
so highly of his wisdom and virtue ,
as not even to presume it possible for him to do anything
inconsistent with his
station and dignity ; and
therefore
has made no provision
to remedy such grievance .
But of
this sufficient was said in a former volume (n), to which I
must refer the reader.

PRINCIPALS

HAVING
shown in the preceding chapter what
persons Principals
are, or are not , capable of committing
crimes , we will rics.
next
make
a few
remarks
on the
different
degrees
of
guilt among persons who are capable of offending ; they
may be principals
or accessories .
pals.
I. A man
may , in the contemplation of our law, be a 1. Princi
principal in an offence
in either of two degrees .
A prin
cipal in the
first
degree , is he who is the actor , or abso
lute perpetrator of the crime ; and in the second
degree
he is , who is present , aiding , and abetting the fact to be
done (a).
Which
presence
need
not always be an actual
immediate
standing
by, within
sight
or hearing
of the
fact ; but there may be also a constructive
presence, as
when
one commits
a robbery
or
murder ,
and
another
keeps watch
or guard
at some convenient
distance (b) .
So in case of murder by poisoning , a man may be a prin
cipal
felon , by preparing
and laying the poison , or per
suading
another
to drink it (c) who is ignorant
of its
poisonous
quality (d) , or giving it to him for that pur
pose ; and yet not administer
it himself, nor be present
when the very deed of poisoning
is committed
( e) .

II. Accesso-

ries.
the same reasoning will
hold , with regard to other mur-
ders committed in the absence of the murderer , by means
which
he had prepared beforehand , and which
probably
could not fail of their
mischievous
effect .
As by laying
a trap or pitfall for another , whereby he is killed : letting
out a wild
beast , with an intent
to do mischief , or ex-
citing a madman to commit murder , so that
death there-
upon ensues ; in every of these
cases the party offending
is guilty of murder
as
a principal , in
the first
degree .
For he
cannot
be
called
an
accessory , that necessarily
presupposing
a principal
;
and the
poison , the
pitfall ,
the beast, and the madman , cannot be held principals ,
being
only the instruments
of death .
As therefore
he
must
be certainly guilty either
as principal
or accessory,
and cannot be so as accessory
, it follows that he must be
guilty
as
principal ,
and if
principal ,
then in
the
first
degree
;
for there
is
no
other
criminal ,
much
less
a
superior in the guilt ,
whom
he
could
aid ,
abet ,
or
assist (f).
II. An accessory
is he who is not the chief
actor in the
offence , nor present at its performance , but is some way
concerned therein , either
before or after the fact com-
mitted .
In considering
the nature of which degree of
guilt ,
we will ,
first ,
examine
what
offences
admit
of
accessories
, and what
not :
secondly ,
who
may
be
an
accessory
before the fact : thirdly , who may be an acces-
sory after
it :
and , lastly, how accessories ,
considered
merely
as
such, and distinct
from
principals ,
are
to be
treated .
1. And , first , as to what
offences
admit of accessories ,
and what
not .
In high treason there are no accessories
,
but all are principals
: the same acts , which make a man
accessory in felony , making
him a principal in treason ,
upon account of the heinousness of the crime (g).

WHAT OFFENCES
ADMIT
OF ACCESSORIES .
35
sides , it is to be
considered , that
the
bare
intent
to
commit treason is many times actual treason : as imag-
ining the death of the king , or conspiring to take away his
crown.
And , as no one can advise and abet such a crime
without
an
intention
to have it done, there can be no
accessories
before the
fact ;
since the
very advice
and
abetment
amount
to
principal
treason.
But this
will
not hold in the inferior
species of treason , which
do not
amount to the
legal idea of compassing the death of the
king, queen, or prince .
For in those no advice to commit
them, unless the thing be actually performed , will
make
a man
a principal traitor (h).
In
murder
and
other
felonies there
may be
accessories
:
except only in those
offences , which in judgment
of law are
sudden and un-
premeditated ,
as
manslaughter
and
the
like ;
which
therefore
cannot
have any accessories
before the fact (i).
So too in crimes
under the degree of felony , there are no
accessories
either before or after the fact ; but all persons
concerned
therein , if guilty
at
all
,
are
principals
(k).
And by the

whosoever
shall

common
or
by
the
statute law
,
shall be
liable
to
be
tried
,
indicted
,
and
punished
as
a
principal
offender
.
The rule that there cannot
be accessories
in treason or
in
misdemeanors
,
the
highest
and
lowest
offences
,
is
grounded
upon
different
reasons
.
In
treason
all
are
principals
,
propter odium delicti
;
in
trespass all
are prin-
cipals
,
because
the law
,
quæ
de
minimis
non
curat
,
does
not descend
to
distinguish
the different
shades
of
guilt
in
petty misdemeanors
.
Further
,
it
is
a
maxim
,
that acces-
sorius sequitur naturam
sui principalis
(1)
:
and therefore
an
accessory cannot
be
guilty
of
a
higher
crime
than
his principal
;
being
only punished
as
a
partaker
of
his
guilt
.

PRINCIPALS
AND
ACCESSORIES .
2. Accessory
beforethe
fact.
2. As to the second point , who
may be an accessory
before the fact ; sir Matthew
Hale (m) defines him to be
one, who
being
absent
at the time of the
crime
com
mitted , doth yet procure , counsel , or command another to
commit
a crime .
Herein
absence
is necessary to make
him an
accessory ; for if such
procurer , or the like , be
present , he is guilty of the crime
as principal .
If A
then
advises B to kill
another , and B
does it in the
absence of A, now B is principal ,
and A is accessory in
the murder .
And this
holds , even though the party
killed be not in rerum naturâ at the
time of the
advice
given .
As if A,
the
reputed
father ,
advises
B , the
mother of a bastard child, unborn , to strangle it when
born , and she does so ; A is accessory to this murder (n) .
And it is also settled (o) , that whoever procures a felony
to be
committed , though it be by the
intervention
of a
third person, is an
accessory
before the fact .
It is like
wise
a
rule , that he who in any
wise
commands
or
counsels another to commit an unlawful act , is accessory
to all that
naturally
or
necessarily
ensues
upon
that
unlawful act ;
but
is not
accessory to any
act distinct
from the other .
As if A commands B to burn C's house ,
and in doing so the house of D is also burnt , B is guilty
of arson as principal , and A is an accessory to the burning
of D's house (p) .
But if A commands B to burn C's
house, and he, in
so doing , commits
a robbery ; now A,
though
accessory to the burning , is not
accessory
to the
robbery , for that is
a thing of a distinct
and unconse
quential nature (7) .
Yet if the felony committed
be the
same in substance with that which
is commanded , and
only varying in some circumstantial
matters ;
as if, upon
a command to poison Titius , he is stabbed or shot , and
dies ; the commander is still
accessory
to the murder , for
the substance of the thing commanded was the death of

Titius , and the manner of its execution is a mere collateral
circumstance ( ).
An accessory
before the fact to any felony may now be
indicted , tried , convicted , and punished in all respects as
if he
were a principal
felon (s).
And
whosoever
shall
counsel, procure , or command any other person to commit
a felony , whether
at
common
or by the
statute
law,
" shall
be guilty of felony ,
and
may be

Therefore ,
to
make
an
accessory
ex post facto , it is in the first
place
requisite
that
he know of the felony committed ( v) .
In
the next place, he must
receive , relieve , comfort , or assist
the felon .
And generally , any assistance whatever given
to
a felon , to hinder
his being
apprehended ,
tried ,
or
suffering
punishment , makes the
assistor
an
accessory .
As furnishing him with a horse
to

his pursuers ,
money or victuals to support him, a house or other shelter
to conceal him, or open force and violence to rescue
or
protect him (x).
So likewise
to convey instruments
to a
felon to enable him to break gaol , or to bribe the gaoler
to let him escape , makes a man an accessory
to the felony .

PRINCIPALS
AND
ACCESSORIES .
But to relieve a felon in gaol with clothes or other neces
saries (unless this be done in breach of the prison regula
tions ) , is
no
offence ; for the crime
imputable
to
this
species
of
accessory
is the
hindrance
of public
justice ,
by assisting
the
felon to
escape
the
vengeance of the
law (y).
:
The felony must
be complete at the time of the assist
ance given ;
else it makes not the assistant
an accessory.
As if one wounds
another mortally , and after the wound
given , but before death ensues , a person assists or receives
the delinquent
this does not make him accessory
to the
homicide ; for , till death
ensues , there is no felony com
mitted (*).
But so strict
is the law where a felony is
actually
complete , in
order
to do
effectual justice ,
that
the nearest
relations
are
not suffered to aid or receive
one another . If the parent assists his child , or the child
his parent , if the brother
receives
the brother , the master
his
servant ,
or the servant his master ,
or
even if the
husband receives his wife , having any of them committed
a
felony ,
the
receiver
becomes
an
accessory
ex post
facto (a).
But a feme-covert cannot become an accessory
by the receipt
and concealment of her husband ; for she
is
presumed
to
act
under
his
coercion , and
therefore
she is
not
bound ,
neither
ought
she , to
discover
her
lord (b).
66
It is now enacted
(c) that an accessory
after the fact to
any felony ,
whether
at common or by the statute
law,
may be indicted
and convicted either as an accessory
after the fact to the principal
felony , together with the
principal
felon , or after the
conviction
of the principal
felon ; or may be indicted
and convicted of a substantive
felony whether the principal
felon shall or shall
not have
been
previously
convicted ,
or
shall
or
shall
not
be
amenable to justice
; and may thereupon
be punished

2ndly ,
subject to some
few
and peculiar exceptions , of which the more important will
hereafter be duly noticed, it must
have proceeded
from
a
guilty mind- it must
have
been
done with
a criminal
intent . A crime involves some degree of moral turpitude ,
because
it
involves
a violation
of our law, which
every
subject of the crown is presumed
to know.

If the prosecutor on a charge of highway robbery is shown
to have connived at it, and to have parted with his goods
or money in virtue of an agreement , it cannot be said in
legal
construction
that
he was
robbed at all ,
since
it
is of the
essence of robbery that the goods or money be
taken against the will of their owner (a).
And , again , it
is by no means unusual
on a trial for a criminal
assault
that the case for the prosecution breaks down on evidence
forthcoming
of consent ; for consent neutralises
as it were
the trespass. Yet this reason does not always hold good so

,
and

,
it

.
For instance
,
the parties
engaged
in

,
and persons present
at

Malice
may also be a material
ingredient
in a criminal
act, which , if this
ingredient
were absent,
might be dispunishable
(h).
Oftentimes the ingredient
of malice is implied
and dis
cerned by our law where there
is
none
ostensible
and
express
; proof that an act was done illegally may suffice
to show that it was
done maliciously .
For
example ,
a
justice of the
peace , acting
under the advice of counsel ,
improperly
refused to grant a beer licence .
There was no
proof that he had
been actuated by any malicious inten
tion in refusing
it ; but , on the contrary , it sufficiently
appeared that he had meant to do in the matter what was
right .
Nevertheless , the act being illegal , was held to be
the subject of an indictment (¿).
If the
governor of an island
dependent

crown
-though
possibly governed by laws differing
from
those
which

one

an illegal
punishment ,
or
employ
illegal
means-as the infliction of torture , for extracting
a con

misapprehension of
his powers and misconception
of the law, the person
so
acting may expose himself to
a criminal
prosecution (k),

having " unlawfully and

done
an
act
oppressive and grievous to the prosecutor .

INDICTABLE OFFENCES
or negli
gence.
3. An act may be criminal
and indictable
as involving
a breach of duty
evidenced by negligence ;
and
such
breach of duty , may be commissive
or permissive—may
consist in some sort of misfeasance , or malfeasance , or
in nonfeasance (m).
It might not be possible to enumerate all legal
duties ,
though
they
do admit
of being
classified
more
or
less
elaborately by reference to the matters whereto
they have
relation , and the
persons by and
to whom
respectively
they
are owing .
Perpetually
,
as
new
combinations
of
circumstances
present themselves , do legal duties
novel
to
the
practitioner
become
disclosed .
Sometimes
the
legislature
by express enactment
creates
and
defines
a
legal duty owing
to the public , or to some
section of it ;
sometimes
our customary law, by that
inherent power of
accommodating
itself to new facts which
pre-eminently
distinguishes
it , declares
, as it were, such a duty , when an
apt occasion arises for so doing .
For exemplifying
our
present
subject , it will
suffice, however , to
specify
one
ordinary form of breach of duty constituted by negligence .
The negligent doing
of an act may afford ground
for
an
indictment .
Thus ,
a
body
corporate will be indictable
for negligently
executing works
entrusted to them to the
detriment of the
public , the object of the
proceeding in
such a case
being
the abatement
or suppression of the
nuisance (n).
Again , by s. 36 of the
statute
hereafter
noticed con
has been judicially observed (Rex v.
Dover , 6 St. Tr. 547) that there are
some things which a jury
are
not
to expect
evidence
of, which
it is
impossible
to know but by the act
itself.
(m) Nonfeasance is the omittingto
do that which there is alegal obliga
tion
or it may be an obligation
by
contract - to perform .
Misfeasance
is the doing in an improper
manner
of that which it was a man's duty
to do, or which he had
a right to
do .
Malfeasance
is the wrongful or
unjustifiable
doing of an act which
the party had no right to do, or had
contracted
not to do . Chitty's Gen.

Here we

commissive

permissive
breach of
duty-breach of duty evidenced by an unlawful
act, and
breach
of duty evidenced
by wilful
omission , -and the
reason
why such commission
or omission is by statute
made indictable
is this-the breach of duty prejudices the
public , or is calculated to do so , and therefore ought to be
repressed .
The main ingredients
in
an indictable

:
punishment
was
liable
to be inflicted .
Treason
itself,
says sir Edward
Coke (q) , was anciently comprised
under
the name of felony
and in confirmation
of this we may
observe that the statute of treasons , 25 Edw . 3 , st . 5 , c. 2 ,
speaking of some dubious
crimes , directs
a reference to
parliament ; that it may there
be
adjudged , " whether
they be treason, or other felony ."
All treasons therefore ,
strictly speaking , were felonies ; though
all felonies were
not treason.
And to this we may add, that not
only all
capital
offences
were in some degree
or other felony , but
that this was likewise the case with some other offences ,
which were not
punished with
death ;
as
suicide ,
and
homicide by chance -medley , which were (strictly speaking )
felonies ,
as
they
subjected the
committers
of them
to
forfeitures .
So
that
upon the whole the only adequate.
definition
of felony seems
to be
that
before laid
down ;
viz . , an offence which
occasioned
a total forfeiture of either
lands , or goods , or both , at the
common
law ;
and
to
which capital or other punishment
was formerly in almost
every case superadded , according to the degree ofguilt .
To explain
this
matter
a little
further
:
the
word
"felony " or felonia , is of undoubted feudal origin, being
frequently to be met with in the books of feuds , &c. ; but
the derivation of it has much
puzzled
the juridical
lexi
cographers , Prateus , Calvinus , and the rest :
some
de
riving it from the Greek
onλos, an impostor
or deceiver ;
others from the Latin fallo, fefelli , to countenance which
they would have it called fallonia .
Sir Edward
Coke , as
his manner is , has given us a still stranger etymology (r) ;
that is crimen animo felleo
perpetratum , with a bitter
or
gallish inclination
.
But all our authentic writers
agree
in the
description , that
felony is such
a crime
as occa
sioned a forfeiture of the offender's lands or goods .
And
this gives probability
to sir Henry Spelman's Teutonic
or
German
derivation
of it (s) : in which
language

THEIR
CLASSIFICATION
.
47
as the word is clearly of feudal origin , we ought rather to
look for its signification
,
than
among
the
Greeks
and
Romans.
Fe-lon then , according to him, is derived from
the two northern
words :
fer ,
which
signifies
(we well
know) the fief, feud , or beneficiary
estate : and lon , which
signifies
price or value .
Felony is
therefore the same as
pretium feudi, the consideration for which a man gave up
his fief; as we say in common
speech , such an act is as
much
as
your
life , or
estate , is worth .
Thus it will
clearly signify the feudal
forfeiture , or act by which
an
estate was forfeited , or escheated
to the lord.
To confirm
which
we may observe , that it is
in
this
sense, of forfeiture
to the lord , that the
feudal
writers
constantly use it.
For all
those
acts ,
whether
of
a
criminal
nature
or not , which
at this day are generally
forfeitures of
copyhold
estates (t) , are styled felonia in
the feudal law : " scilicet, per quas feudum amittitur ” (u).
As,
si domino deservire
noluerit (x) ;
si per
annum
et
diem
cessarerit
in petendâ
investiturâ (y) ;
si
dominum
ejuravit , i.e.
negavit
se a domino
feudum
habere (≈) ; si a
domino , injus eum vocante , ter citatus non comparuerit ” (a) ;
all these, with many others , are still
causes
of forfeiture
in our copyhold
estates , and were
denominated
felonies
by the feudal
constitutions .
So
likewise
injuries
of a
more
substantial
or
criminal
nature
were denominated
felonies , that
is , forfeitures
: as assaulting or beating the
lord (b) ; vitiating
his
wife
or
daughter , " si
dominum
cucurbitaverit,
i.e.
cum
uxore
ejus
concubuerit " (c) ;
all
these were esteemed
felonies , and the latter was expressly
so
denominated , " si
fecerit
feloniam ,
dominum
forte
cucurbitando " (d).

offences , were felonies ,
or
acts
of forfeiture , of course
greater
crimes ,
as
murder
and
robbery , fell under
the
same denomination .
On the other hand , the lord
might
be guilty of felony , or forfeit
his seignory to the
vassal ,
by the
same
acts as the vassal would
have forfeited
his
feud to the lord . " Si dominus commisit feloniam , per
quam vassallus amitteret feudum si eam commiserit
in domi-
num, feudi proprietatem etiam dominus perdere
debet " (e).
One instance
given of this sort of felony in the lord
is
beating the servant of his vassal , so as that
he loses
his
service ;
which
seems
merely in
the
nature
of
a civil
injury, so far as it respects the vassal .
And all these
felonies
were to be determined " per laudamentum sive
judicium parium suorum " in the lord's
court :
as with us
forfeitures
of
copyhold
lands
are
presentable
by
the
homage in the court -baron .
Felony, and the act of forfeiture
to the lord , being thus
synonymous terms in the feudal law, we may easily trace
the reason why ,
upon the introduction
of that law into
England, those crimes which
induced
such forfeiture
or
escheat
of lands
(and, by a small
deflection from the
original
sense , such
as
induced the forfeiture
of goods
also) were denominated
felonies .
Thus it was said , that
suicide ,
robbery , and rape, were felonies : that
is , the
consequence
of such
crimes was forfeiture
; till by long
use we began to signify by the term of felony the actual
crime committed , and not the penal
consequence
thereof.
And upon this system only can we account for the
cause ,
why treason in ancient times was held to be a species
of
felony : viz . because
it induced a forfeiture .
Hence it follows , that
capital
punishment
does
by no
means enter into
the true idea and definition
of felony .
Felony might have been without inflicting capital punish-
ment ,
as in the
cases
of self-murder ,
and
excusable
homicide
and capital
punishment
was formerly
inflicted
for an offence
not felonious
; thus heresy by the common

law, of which in the
ensuing
chapter
we
shall

though capital , never worked

of lands
or

inseparable
incident
to felony .
And of
the
same nature was the punishment
of standing mute ,
without pleading to an indictment
; which at the common
law was capital , but without
any forfeiture , and therefore
such
standing
mute was no felony .
In short , the
true
criterion of felony is forfeiture
; for , as sir
Edward
Coke
justly observes (g) , in all felonies punishable with death ,
in his time , the offender lost all his lands in fee -simple ,
and also his goods and chattels ; in such

Introduc-

CHAPTER
V.
OFFENCES
AGAINST
RELIGION .
IN the present
chapter we are to enter upon the detail
of the several
species
of
crimes , with the
punishment
annexed to each by the law of
England .
It was
ob-
served, in the beginning
of this Book (a) , that a crime
is a breach
and violation
of
a public right
and
duty ,
owing to the whole
community , considered as a commu-
nity, in its social aggregate capacity .
And at the very
commencement of these Commentaries (b) it was
shown ,
that human laws can have no concern with any but social
and relative duties ;
being
intended
only to regulate
the
conduct of man , considered
under various
relations , as
a
member
of
society.
All crimes
ought
therefore
to be
estimated merely according
to the mischiefs which
they
produce in society (c) : and , of consequence
, private vices,
in breach of mere
absolute duties , which a man
is
bound
to
perform
considered
only
as
an
individual
, are
not,
cannot be, the
object of any municipal
law ;
any further
than as by their evil example , or other pernicious
effects ,
they may prejudice
the community , and thereby become
public crimes .
Thus the vice of drunkenness , if com-
mitted
privately
and alone , is beyond the knowledge
and
of course beyond
the reach of human
tribunals
:
but if
committed
publicly, in the
face of the
world ,
its
evil
example
makes it liable
to temporal
censure.
The vice
of lying , which consists (abstractedly taken ) in a criminal

51
violation
of truth, and therefore
in
any shape is dero-
gatory from
sound morality , is not however taken
notice
of by our law, unless it carries with it some
public
in-
convenience
, as if there be a conspiracy to raise the price
of the funds by spreading
false
news (d) , or some social
injury , as slander and malicious
prosecution , for which
a
private recompense is given .
And yet drunkenness
and
malevolent lying may in foro conscientiæ
be as thoroughly
criminal when
they
are
not ,
as when they are, attended
with public inconvenience .
The
only difference is , that
both public
and
private
vices are subject to the
ven-
geance
of eternal
justice
; and public vices are besides
liable to temporal punishment by human tribunals .
On the other hand , there are
some
offences
punishable
by the municipal
law, which
have in themselves nothing
criminal , but are made unlawful
by the positive
constitu-
tions
of the
state
for
public
convenience.
Such
as
smuggling , shooting
game without
a certificate , and the
like.
These are naturally no
offences
at all ; but their
whole
criminality consists in disobedience to the supreme
power , which
has an undoubted right , for the well-being
and
peace of the
community , to make some things
un-
lawful, which were in themselves indifferent .
Upon the
whole , therefore , though some of the
offences
to be enu-
merated in the following
sheets
are offences
against the
revealed law of God , others
against the law of nature ,
and some are offences against
neither ; yet in a treatise
of municipal
law we must
consider them all as deriving
their
particular
guilt , here punishable , from the law of
man .
the subject.
Having premised this caution , I shall proceed to distri- Division of
bute the several offences , which
are either
directly
or by
consequence
injurious
to
civil
society,
and
therefore
punishable
by the laws of England , under the following
general
heads : first, those which
are more immediately
injurious
to
religion ;
secondly ,

thirdly,
such
as
more
especially

and

;
fourthly, such as more directly infringe
the rights of the
public
or commonwealth
; and , lastly, such
as derogate
from those rights
and duties , which
are owing to parti
cular individuals
, and in the preservation and vindication
of which the community
is deeply interested .

;
and mediately

consequence
,

;
which consti
tutes that guilt
in
the action
,
which human tribunals
have
in
former
,
far more frequently than
in
later times
,
assumed
to censure
.
I.
Of this species
the first
to
be mentioned
is
apostasy
,
or
a
total renunciation
of
christianity
,
by embracing
either
a
false religion
,
or
no religion
at
all
.
Apostasy
is
now
punishable
only when
brought
within the words
of
a
statute
presently
set forth
,
and can only
take
place
in
such
as
have once professed the true religion
.
The per
version
of
a
christian
to
judaism
,
paganism
,
or
other false
religion
,
was punished by the emperors Constantius
and
Julian
with
confiscation
of
goods
(e);
to
which the
emperors
Theodosius
and
Valentinian
added
capital
punishment
,
in
case the apostate endeavoured
to
pervert
others
to
the
same iniquity
(f
).
A
punishment
too
severe for any temporal laws
to
inflict upon any spiritual
offence
and yet
the zeal
of
our
ancestors imported
it
into this country
;
for we find by Bracton
(
g),
that
in
his
time
apostates were
to
be burnt
to
death
.
Doubtless the
preservation
of
christianity
,
as
a
national
religion
,
is,
abstracted from its own intrinsic truth
,
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
the civil state

affronts

in

For
a
long time
,
indeed
,
the offence
of
apostasy was cognisable
only by the
ecclesiastical
courts
,
which
corrected
the
offender pro salute animæ
.
But about the
close
of
the
17th century
,
the civil liberties
to
which
we were then
restored
being used
as
a
cloak
of
maliciousness
,
and doc
trines
subversive
of
all
religion
being
publicly avowed
both
in
discourse and writings
,
it
was thought
necessary
for the civil power
to
interpose
,
by not admitting
those
miscreants
(

to
the privileges
of
society

who
maintained such principles
as
destroyed all moral obliga

OFFENCES

II. Heresy.
of being guardian , executor , legatee , or donee , and
shall
suffer three years ' imprisonment
without
bail.
To give
room however for repentance , if, within four months after
the first conviction , the delinquent
in open court publicly
renounces
his error , he is discharged
for that once
from
disabilities .
II. Concerning
heresy, although
no longer
cognisable
by courts
temporal , a few remarks
may not be inappro-
priate .
Heresy consisted , not in a total
denial of chris-
tianity, but in a denial of some of its essential doctrines ,
publicly and
obstinately
avowed ;
being
defined by sir
Matthew Hale, " sententia
rerum divinarum
humano
sensu
excogitata , palam docta
et pertinaciter defensa (k)."
What
doctrines were to be adjudged heresy , was left by our old
constitution
to
the
determination
of the
ecclesiastical
judge ; who had herein a most arbitrary
latitude
allowed
him.
For
the
general
definition
of a heretic
given
by
Lyndewode
(1) , extends to the smallest
deviations
from
the
doctrines of holy church : " hœriticus est qui dubitat
de fide catholicâ,
et qui negligit servare ea, quæ Romana
ecclesia statuit , seu servare
decreverit ."
Or, as the statute
2 Hen. 4,
c.
15 , expresses
it in English , " teachers of
erroneous
opinions ,
contrary
to the faith
and
blessed
determinations
of the holy church ."
Very contrary this
to the usage of the first general councils , which defined all
heretical
doctrines with the utmost precision
and exact-
ness .
And what ought to have alleviated the punishment ,
the
uncertainty
of the
crime ,
seems
to have enhanced
it in those days of blind zeal and pious
cruelty .
It is
true that the sanctimonious
hypocrisy
of the canonists
went
at first
no
further than
enjoining
penance, ex-
communication , and ecclesiastical deprivation , for heresy ;
though afterwards they proceeded
boldly
to imprisonment
by the ordinary , and confiscation
of goods
in pios
usus .
They prevailed also upon the weakness of bigoted princes ,
